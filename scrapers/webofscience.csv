Traditionally, SBL is practised in architecture and art programmes, however there is a growing number of research in other areas such as computer science, engineering, entrepreneurship and design courses. Nevertheless, in Malaysia, studies have only focused on architecture programmes. Therefore, this study focuses on reporting the experience and challenges of implementing SBL for a design course in the area of Visual Communication. By employing a qualitative methodology, findings show positive perception towards SBL where respondents reported awareness in improved design and communication skills, and increased acceptance towards team work. They found the critique sessions, facilitated their learning progress. Nevertheless, students reported challenges with inept teaching and learning facilities for design work, collaboration and communication breakdown with stakeholders. The study also reports on improvement strategies to enhance students learning experience through SBL.;"[Kumar, Jeya Amantha] Univ Sains Malaysia, Ctr Instruct Technol & Multimedia, George Town, Malaysia; [Silva, Paula Alexandra] Univ Coimbra, Dept Comp Sci, Fac Sci & Technol, Rua Silvio Lima,Polo 2, Coimbra, Portugal; [Prelath, Renugha] Politekn METrO Tasek Gelugor, Tasek Gelugor, Penang, Malaysia";Kumar, JA (reprint author), Univ Sains Malaysia, Ctr Instruct Technol & Multimedia, George Town, Malaysia.;jeya.amantha@gmail.com;"Kumar, Jeya Amantha/B-3262-2018; Silva, Paula Alexandra/N-5939-2014";"Kumar, Jeya Amantha/0000-0002-6920-0348; Silva, Paula Alexandra/0000-0003-1573-7446";Universiti Sains MalaysiaUniversiti Sains Malaysia [304/PMEDIA/6315219];The Universiti Sains Malaysia supported this work under USM Short Term Grant [304/PMEDIA/6315219].;;45;0;0;8;8;SPRINGER;DORDRECHT;VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS;0957-7572;1573-1804;;INT J TECHNOL DES ED;Int.

In this paper, authors present main results and lessons learned from courses on software engineering. Specifically, the aim of this paper is the study of the selection and the adoption of software engineering tools by students working in teams, in the context of a software engineering course. The purpose of the study is analysing the students' decision making process and reasoning strategies to such selection. In this scenario, driven by a project based learning approach, a qualitative study on the use of specific tools to support group work was conducted. Results reveal that students demonstrate a rational decision making process based on logical efficient reasoning. As consequence six lessons have been learned: everything in one place; the new over the known; freedom over imposition; performance and freedom; social influence and secondary role of project management. In addition, these six lessons have been compared with previous literature in the topic and backing them up with main theories in the field. Finally, authors reflect on the implications of such lessons learned analyzing deeply aspects like freedom of choice, performance, tools features, imposition and social influence, to bring a set of grounded argumentations to the reader.";"[Colomo-Palacios, Ricardo; Samuelsen, Terje] Ostfold Univ Coll, BRA Veien 4, N-1783 Halden, Norway; [Casado-Lumbreras, Cristina] Univ Complutense Madrid, Campus Somosaguas, Madrid 28223, Spain; [Larrucea, Xabier] Tecnalia, Parque Tecnol Bizkaia,Calle Geldo,Edificio 700, E-48160 Derio, Bizkaia, Spain";Colomo-Palacios, R (reprint author), Ostfold Univ Coll, BRA Veien 4, N-1783 Halden, Norway.;"ricardo.colomo-palacios@hiof.no; terje.samuelsen@hiof.no; crcasado@ucm.es; xabier.larrucea@tecnalia.com";;;;;;54;0;0;9;9;TEMPUS PUBLICATIONS;DURRUS, BANTRY;IJEE , ROSSMORE,, DURRUS, BANTRY, COUNTY CORK 00000, IRELAND;0949-149X;;;INT J ENG EDUC;Int.

Since social and teamwork issues have been consistently identified as serious problems in such projects, we aim to better understand the breakdown between the expectations teams have at the start of a group project and their experiences at the end of the project. In this paper, we investigate how 35 teams of undergraduate students approach software engineering group project courses, and how their previous experience with collaborative software development matches their expectations for group work. We then analyse the retrospective documents delivered by the same teams at the end of a 27-week software engineering group project course, mirroring the expectations at the start of the project with the realities described by the end of it.

Engineering students of several knowledge areas may benefit with the introduction of internet of things concepts in the undergraduate courses, since there is an increasingly need of professionals to work in multidisciplinary teams. This paper proposes an undergraduate course to teach internet of things concepts for engineering students using cooperative problem-based learning (CPBL). The students have to develop a project using different internet of things technologies: sensing and actuation, embedded computing, communication and networking, cloud computing, and data analytics. The proposed course may help students to improve not only their technical skills but also soft skills, such as teamwork, communication and creativity. The developed projects achieved good results, and positive feedback was received from the students.

On the other hand, they have also proven to be difficult to grade in a balanced way which would be perceived as fair by the students. Numerical ratings such as those delivered by the Fink method provide ways to determine the shares of contributions of each individual team member. But such bare numerical evaluation needs also some secondary justification that helps team members to understand why their rating is high or low. Methods to collect such additional feedback often rely on surveys; however, extensive surveys may be perceived as tedious by the students, especially as they need to be filled out for each other team member participating in the team. This may have negative effect on the quality of feedback collected in form of surveys. We present a novel approach to peer assessment of a team-based project exploiting badges that represent individual contributions to the task and teamwork related traits. We show that this approach has positive influence on engagement in peer assessment compared to free-text open questions.

Creation of new interdisciplinary capstone courses may not be feasible for some departments or institutions, however, due to administrative or funding complexities. As an alternative, the inclusion of interdisciplinary projects engaging students enrolled in separate single-discipline capstone courses may offer the opportunity to undertake interesting projects, or engage with certain sponsors, that would not be possible without the contributions of students from diverse disciplines. Having such projects undertaken by interdisciplinary teams of students who remain in their single-discipline capstone courses does not reduce, and may amplify, the challenges found in full-fledged interdisciplinary capstone courses (e.g., misaligned schedules, differing requirements, and unfamiliar working cultures). This paper provides findings from the pilot year of a series of opportunistic interdisciplinary capstone projects associated with NASA's Psyche Asteroid Mission involving students from computer science, computer systems engineering, engineering management, industrial design, and graphic design. The findings highlight the importance of close communication and flexibility between faculty and identify a novel and potentially-replicable approach of including project management capstone students on interdisciplinary teams. The paper also describes changes that were implemented for the national expansion of the program with the 2018-2019 academic year and provides early lessons learned associated with those changes, outlining a plan for iterative improvement.;"[Bowman, Catherine D.

Faculty accumulated nearly 12 years of experience running a graduate software engineering capstone course perceived the need to better assist students on the learning process. Course adaptations are required, particularly considering the heterogeneity of student's background and work experience, as well as the use of current technologies and tools. The paper outlines an evolved graduate software engineering capstone course for part-time graduate professional students. The capstone course is intended to create a meaningful student experience while providing a productive environment to apply knowledge learned from the program. Moreover, the new proposal emphasizes agile methodologies and code as the primary artifact. Our main contribution is to present the evolution of this capstone course, from inception to coding, testing and deployment. The course revision includes new artifacts, such as a work breakdown structure and burndown chart, as means to improve the course learning outcomes based on lessons learned and student experience. For evaluation purposes, we selected groups of most recent capstone course sections totaling 175 students. Two learning objectives of the program were evaluated: teamwork and critical thinking. Critical thinking was assessed via the project plan artifact. Teamwork was assessed through discussion forums, team test plans and reports.

Combined FC-PBL makes use of learning technologies and supports authentic learning in terms of authentic context, multiple perspectives through team work and collaboration. FC involves watching educational videos prior to class session, and using the class session for practical tasks, thus supporting programming skills development. PBL enables authentic learning activities through group work and helps students to develop 21st century skills such as self-direction, collaboration, creativity and innovation. A research case study was conducted that considered a three-stage based delivery of the module that involved traditional, only FC, and combined FC-PBL teaching approaches applied on a number of programming topics. Both the educational and edutainment benefits were analyzed. The results show that combined FC-PBL approach is effective and the knowledge acquired by students improves, in particular, for the weaker students. Only 1.9% of students have scored an assessment mark lower than 40% compared to 28.3% and 24.5% when the traditional teaching and FC-only approaches respectively were used. Overall, a 26.56% increase in the assessment results was noticed when combined FC-PBL was used. The edutainment element was investigated through a questionnaire that assessed learning environment, engagement, learner satisfaction and whether the students have enjoyed learning sessions. The survey analysis shows that the combined FC-PBL approach does aid in the edutainment of mature students and provides an enjoyable learning experience.;"[Chis, Adriana E.; Moldovan, Arghir-Nicolae; Murphy, Lisa; Pathak, Pramod; Muntean, Cristina Hava] Natl Coll Ireland, Sch Comp, Dublin, Ireland";Muntean, CH (reprint author), Natl Coll Ireland, Sch Comp, Dublin, Ireland.;"adriana.chis@ncirl.ie; arghir.moldovan@ncirl.ie; lisa.murphy@ncirl.ie; pramod.pathak@ncirl.ie; cristina.muntean@ncirl.ie";;;NEWTON project under the European Union's Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation programme [688503];This research is supported by the NEWTON project (http://www.newtonproject.eu/) funded under the European Union's Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation programme, Grant Agreement no. 688503.;;57;5;5;3;42;NATL TAIWAN NORMAL UNIV, TAIWAN;TAIPEI;129, SEC 1, HEPING E RD, EDUCATION BUILDING, RM 611, TAIPEI, 10644, TAIWAN;1176-3647;1436-4522;;EDUC TECHNOL SOC;Educ.

Findings from this paper suggest that it is not enough to consider student-reported data in assessing team dynamics; hidden gendered behavior may be impacting students in ways that students do not realize or report. Background: Although the number of women in engineering is rising, difficulties still exist for female students in electrical engineering and computer science, particularly in team projects. Male and female students may have very different project experiences, due to differing levels of confidence/self-efficacy, difficult team dynamics, or inequitable task division. Research Questions: This paper aimed to elucidate what differences exist in the project experience between male and female students, considering self-reported measures (engineering confidence/self-efficacy, time spent on task, and team satisfaction) and observational study. Methodology: Students completed pre/post-project surveys, weekly logs, and post-project interviews to report and discuss their engineering confidence/self-efficacy, project task selection, and team satisfaction. This paper reports a case study of one student team, observed by a researcher throughout the project course. Findings: While student-reported data implied a lack of gender division (male and female students had the same levels of confidence, completed the same project tasks, and were similarly satisfied with their teams), the observational study implied that the student-reported data may not be telling the whole story. Given the difficult team dynamics observed in the student team (but not reported by students), findings suggest that difficult gender dynamics may go unrecognized by students.";[Hirshfield, Laura J.] Univ Michigan, Dept Chem Engn, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA;Hirshfield, LJ (reprint author), Univ Michigan, Dept Chem Engn, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.;lhirshfi@umich.edu;;Hirshfield, Laura/0000-0002-6723-670X;University of Michigan through Transforming Learning in the Third Century Grant;This work was supported by the University of Michigan through the Transforming Learning in the Third Century Grant.;;30;1;1;0;3;IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC;PISCATAWAY;445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA;0018-9359;1557-9638;;IEEE T EDUC;IEEE Trans.

This paper investigates the use of diverse sensors, including computer vision, user-generated content, and data from the learning objects (physical computing components), to record high-fidelity synchronised multimodal recordings of small groups of learners interacting. We processed and extracted different aspects of the students' interactions to answer the following question: Which features of student group work are good predictors of team success in open-ended tasks with physical computing? To answer this question, we have explored different supervised machine learning approaches (traditional and deep learning techniques) to analyse the data coming from multiple sources. The results illustrate that state-of-the-art computational techniques can be used to generate insights into the ""black box"" of learning in students' project-based activities. The features identified from the analysis show that distance between learners' hands and faces is a strong predictor of students' artefact quality, which can indicate the value of student collaboration. Our research shows that new and promising approaches such as neural networks, and more traditional regression approaches can both be used to classify multimodal learning analytics data, and both have advantages and disadvantages depending on the research questions and contexts being investigated.

J;Yagci, M;;;;Yagci, Mustafa;;;Web-Mediated Problem-Based Learning and Computer Programming: Effects of Study Approach on Academic Achievement and Attitude;JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL COMPUTING RESEARCH;;;English;Article;;;;;;"problem-based learning; study approach; attitude toward programming; academic achievement; blended learning; web-based learning";"PROCESS QUESTIONNAIRE; STUDENTS; STYLES; ONLINE; IMPLEMENTATION; PARTICIPATION; PERFORMANCE; EFFICACY";In the relevant literature, it is often debated whether learning programming requires high-level thinking skills, the lack of which consequently results in the failure of students in programming. The complex nature of programming and individual differences, including study approaches, thinking styles, and the focus of supervision, all have an effect on students' achievement in programming. How students learn programming and the relationships between their study approaches and their achievement in programming have not yet been adequately illuminated. In this regard, the present study aims to investigate the effect of the study approach used on students' attitudes toward programming and on their academic achievement within an online problem-based learning environment. In this study, a single-factor, pretest posttest single group and semiempirical method was utilized. The study was conducted on 41 students from a public university in Turkey. To implement problem-based learning activities, a teaching environment was created with the Moodle platform, allowing for group work and discussions. Seven status of the problems were prepared exclusively for the 12-week application period so that students could make suggestions about how to solve them. In the data collection phase, the Study Approach Scale, the Attitude Towards Programming Scale, and the Academic Achievement Test were employed. T-test and covariance analyses were carried out in the statistical analysis phase. According to the findings of the present study, students adopting the deep study approach were more successful than the students adopting a superficial approach. Moreover, it was determined that the problem-based learning application had a positive effect on students' attitudes toward programming and that the study approach did not significantly affect the students' attitude toward programming.;[Yagci, Mustafa] Ahi Evran Univ, Dept Comp Educ & Instruct Technol, Kirsehir, Turkey;Yagci, M (reprint author), Ahi Evran Univ, Fac Educ, TR-40100 Kirsehir, Turkey.;mustafayagci06@gmail.com;Yagci, Mustafa/V-4203-2017;;;;;75;2;2;3;23;SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC;THOUSAND OAKS;2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA;0735-6331;1541-4140;;J EDUC COMPUT RES;J.

Most of the instructional strategies used to help students take advantage of these activities focus on supporting agile programming, which is appropriate for capstone courses. This is not always recommended in initial software engineering project courses, however, where novice developers run projects in teams while simultaneously taking other courses. To enhance the learning and teamwork experience in this latter instructional scenario, this paper proposes a formative monitoring method, reflexive weekly monitoring (RWM), for use in project courses that involve disciplined software processes and loosely coupled work. RWM uses self-reflection and collaborative learning practices to help students be aware of their individual and team performance. RWM was applied in a case study over nine consecutive semesters. The results obtained indicate that RWM was effective in enhancing the learning experience in the instructional scenario studied. While students in the monitored teams were more effective and coordinated, and experienced a higher sense of team belonging and satisfaction, little evidence was found of them being more productive than students working in non-monitored teams.;"[Marques, Maira; Ochoa, Sergio F.; Bastarrica, Maria Cecilia; Gutierrez, Francisco J.] Univ Chile, Dept Comp Sci, Santiago 8370459, Chile";Marques, M (reprint author), Univ Chile, Dept Comp Sci, Santiago 8370459, Chile.;"mmarques@dcc.uchile.cl; sochoa@dcc.uchile.cl; cecilia@dcc.uchile.cl; frgutier@dcc.uchile.cl";SAMARY, MAIRA MARQUES/Q-8247-2019;SAMARY, MAIRA MARQUES/0000-0001-5347-1664;"Project Fondef IDeAComision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)CONICYT FONDEF [IT13I20010]; Conicyt Chile (CONICYT-PCHA/Doctorado Nacional) [2012-21120544]";This work was supported by the Project Fondef IDeA under Grant IT13I20010.

Along the previous editions of the course several issues have been discovered, which are intended to be solved with the proposed method that was used as evaluation system of the subject in year 2016-2017. The issues are related to the number of students of each degree that compose the group each year, the contents' deviation, the low marks obtained in previous years, the methodological mismatch in relation with other subjects and the bad alignment of the evaluation method used before. With the idea of obtaining better marks, a closer experience to the real situation in software companies and higher satisfaction level of the students, the learning experience proposed implies teamwork, a project-based learning perspective and a balanced use of the technologies. Taking the results obtained through its implantation along the last academic year, it can be concluded that the evaluation method shown in this document enhances the learning process and the contents are closer to the course initial conception, and students got more involved and obtained better results.;"[Gutierrez-Martinez, Jose-Maria; Castillo-Martinez, Ana; Aguado-Delgado, Juan; Barchino, Roberto; Oton, Salvador] Univ Alcala De Henares, Super Polytech Sch, Dept Comp Sci, Alcala De Henares 28871, Spain";Gutierrez-Martinez, JM (reprint author), Univ Alcala De Henares, Super Polytech Sch, Dept Comp Sci, Alcala De Henares 28871, Spain.;"josem.gutierrez@uah.es; ana.castillo@uah.es; j.aguado@edu.uah.es; salvador.oton@uah.es";Barchino, Roberto/G-5837-2011;Barchino, Roberto/0000-0002-5657-5191;University of Alcala [UAH/EV860];This work has been supported by the University of Alcala under the training innovation project UAH/EV860 Evaluacion por proyectos en computacion Ubicua, which was rewarded with 500 (sic) to buy material for the following years.;;26;0;0;1;2;TEMPUS PUBLICATIONS;DURRUS, BANTRY;IJEE , ROSSMORE,, DURRUS, BANTRY, COUNTY CORK 00000, IRELAND;0949-149X;;;INT J ENG EDUC;Int.

However, the lack of well-defined methodologies and processes for implementing the PBL approach represents a major challenge. The approach requires great flexibility and dynamism from all involved, whether in mapping content, in teacher performance, or laying out the process of how learners should go about solving problems. This paper suggests that management processes can help in implementing PBL throughout its life cycle (planning, implementation, monitoring, and enhancement), and proposes an assessment model called PBL-SEE for use in software engineering education (SEE). Two examples of its use are provided.

They address a key educational objective, provide students critical experience relevant to their future careers, allow instructors to set problems of greater scale and complexity than could be tackled individually, and are a vehicle for socially constructed learning. While all student teams experience challenges, those in fully online programmes must also deal with remote working, asynchronous coordination, and computermediated communications all of which contribute to greater social distance between team members. We have developed a facilitation framework to aid team collaboration and have demonstrated its efficacy, in prior research, with respect to team performance and outcomes. Those studies indicated, however, that despite experiencing improved project outcomes, students working in effective software engineering teams did not experience significantly improved individual achievement. To address this deficiency we implemented theoretically grounded refinements to the collaboration model based upon peer-tutoring research. Our results indicate a modest, but statistically significant (p =.08), improvement in individual achievement using this refined model.;"[Neill, Colin J.; DeFranco, Joanna F.; Sangwan, Raghvinder S.] Penn State Univ, Sch Grad Profess Studies, Malvern, PA 19355 USA";Neill, CJ (reprint author), Penn State Univ, Sch Grad Profess Studies, Malvern, PA 19355 USA.;jfd104@psu.edu;;Neill, Colin/0000-0001-8712-0918;Research Initiation Grant from the Center for Online Innovation in Learning (COIL-RIG) at Penn State University;This research was supported by a Research Initiation Grant from the Center for Online Innovation in Learning (COIL-RIG) at Penn State University.;;44;1;1;0;4;TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD;ABINGDON;2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND;0304-3797;1469-5898;;EUR J ENG EDUC;Eur.

We provide a description of the teaching and assessment processes adopted, based on a Problem Based Learning (PBL) approach and a weighted self/peer/teacher assessment schema respectively, tackling the main issues that arise when considering these methodologies. Throughout these three course editions a total of 37 students have followed the subject and instructors have given them a great degree of freedom to propose their own projects. This has led to a high degree of motivation and ambition, and it has been rarely necessary to push any additional functionality into their initial proposals. Moreover, the projects as a whole have covered not only a good sample of the most important mobile computing aspects but also very different application areas. On top of this, we have also analyzed the implications of introducing peer-and self-assessment components into the evaluation system. In this respect, we have concluded that not only peer-but also self-assessment can be acceptably close and correlated to the marks given by the teachers.

It is therefore important for graduates to have experienced teamwork before they enter the job market. We describe an experiential learning exercise that we designed to teach the software engineering process in conjunction with teamwork skills. The underlying teaching strategy applied in the exercise maximises risks in order to provide maximal experiential learning opportunities. The students are expected to work in fairly large, yet short-lived, instructor-assigned teams to complete software engineering tasks. After undergoing the exercise our students form self-selected teams for their capstone projects. In this article, we determine and report on the influence the teaching exercise had on the formation of teams for the capstone project. By analysing data provided by the students through regular peer reviews we gain insight into the team dynamics as well as to what extent the members contributed to the team effort. We develop and present a graphical model of a capstone project team which highlights participation of individuals during the teaching exercise. The participatory history of the members is visualised using segmented concentric rings. We consider how this visualisation can aid the identification of capstone project teams that are at risk. In our experience the composition of the team and the behaviour of other members in the team may have a marked impact on the behaviour of each individual in the team. We established a team classification in order to model information about teams. We use a statistical clustering method to classify teams. For this we use team profiles that are based on the participatory levels of its members. The team types that emerge from the clustering are used to derive migration models. When we consider migration, we build spring models to visualise the teams through which individuals migrate. We colour code the teams to characterise them according to the team types that were identified during the cluster classification of the teams. Owing to the complexity of the resulting model, only migrations for capstone team members who have worked together during the exercise or for solitary capstone team members are modelled. These models support the identification of areas of interest that warrant further investigation. To conclude, we present our observations from the analysis of team compositions, team types, and team migrations and provide directions for future work and collaborations.;"[Marshall, Linda; Pieterse, Vreda] Univ Pretoria, Dept Comp Sci, ZA-0002 Pretoria, South Africa; [Thompson, Lisa] Univ Pretoria, Dept Informat Sci, ZA-0002 Pretoria, South Africa; [Venter, Dina M.] RL Technol Trading Red Leaf, Johannesburg, South Africa; [Venter, Dina M.] RL Technol Cc TA Red Leaf, 21 Beauchamp Proctor Rd, ZA-0157 Pierre Van Ryneveld, Centurion, South Africa";"Marshall, L; Pieterse, V (reprint author), Univ Pretoria, Dept Comp Sci, ZA-0002 Pretoria, South Africa.; Thompson, L (reprint author), Univ Pretoria, Dept Informat Sci, ZA-0002 Pretoria, South Africa.; Venter, DM (reprint author), RL Technol Trading Red Leaf, Johannesburg, South Africa.; Venter, DM (reprint author), RL Technol Cc TA Red Leaf, 21 Beauchamp Proctor Rd, ZA-0157 Pierre Van Ryneveld, Centurion, South Africa.";"lmarshall@cs.up.ac.za; vpieterse@cs.up.ac.za; Lisa.Thompson@up.ac.za; dina@red-leaf.co.za";Pieterse, Vreda/AAL-2520-2020;"Pieterse, Vreda/0000-0002-7487-2704; Marshall, Linda/0000-0002-5270-243X";;;;62;3;3;1;24;ASSOC COMPUTING MACHINERY;NEW YORK;2 PENN PLAZA, STE 701, NEW YORK, NY 10121-0701 USA;1946-6226;;;ACM T COMPUT EDUC;ACM Trans.

Through a case-study approach, we test a developed teamwork framework, using manual content analysis and sentiment analysis, to determine if the framework can provide insight into students' teamwork behavior and to determine if the wiki task encouraged students to collaborate, share knowledge, and self-adopt teamwork roles. Analysis revealed the identification of both active and cohesive teams, disengaged students, and particular roles and behaviors that were lacking. Furthermore, sentiment analysis revealed that teamsmoved through positive and negative emotions over the course of developing their solution, toward satisfaction.

In the fall of 2009, we started exploring how software development teams form and interact in a computer science college capstone course setting. Our initial findings were presented at ICER 2010 in Aarhus, Denmark. The focus of our research was on the experiences of computer science college course teams as compared and contrasted to the theory of Bruce Tuckman's stages of small group development model, which he characterized as forming, storming, norming, performing, and adjourning. We continued data collection with the computer science capstone course in the fall of 2010 and added an information systems capstone course as well. At the conclusion of the spring 2014 semester, we have collected and analyzed data for a total of 5 academic years from nine cohorts of students taught by five instructors involving 215 students on 51 teams. Each year, participants repeatedly self-assessed their enthusiasm and skill levels over time using a questionnaire by agreeing or disagreeing to statements. The data shows patterns similar to that of Tuckman's model. Since most people find Tuckman's model easy to understand, it may provide an effective tool to teach teamwork and monitor team development. In addition to briefly presenting our empirical findings in this article, we provide a simple conceptualization of Tuckman's model that can be captured in two data points: enthusiasm and skill level. By comparing changes in these two dimensions over time, team development can be tracked through the various Tuckman stages of small group development.

Involving student teams in real-world projects developed by professional software engineers for actual users is invaluable. Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) has emerged as an important approach to creating, managing, and distributing software products. Involvement in a FOSS project provides students with experience developing within a professional environment, with a professional community, and has the additional benefit that all communication and artifacts are publicly accessible. Humanitarian Free and Open Source Software (HFOSS) projects benefit the human condition in some manner. They can range from disaster management to microfinance to election-monitoring applications. This article discusses the benefits and challenges of students participating in HFOSS projects within the context of undergraduate computing degree programs. This article reports on a 6-year study of students' self-reported attitudes and learning from participation in an HFOSS project. Results indicate that working on an HFOSS project increases interest in computing.

In this article, we examine the implications of multidisciplinarity for students' learning experiences during a one-semester project course for real customers. We use a qualitative research approach and base our analysis on students' learning reports on three instances of a project course titled Multidisciplinary working life project. The main contribution of this article is the unified theoretical picture of the learning mechanisms stemming from multidisciplinarity. Our main conclusions are that (1) students generally have a positive view of multidisciplinarity; (2) multidisciplinary teams enable students to better identify their own expertise, which leads to increased occupational identity; and (3) learning experiences are not fixed, as team spirit and student attitude play an important role in how students react to challenging situations arising from introduction of the multidisciplinarity.";"[Heikkinen, Juho] Univ Jyvaskyla, Agora Ctr, POB 35, FI-40014 Jyvaskyla, Finland; [Heikkinen, Juho; Isomottonen, Ville] Univ Jyvaskyla, Dept Math Informat Technol, FI-40014 Jyvaskyla, Finland";Heikkinen, J (reprint author), Univ Jyvaskyla, Agora Ctr, POB 35, FI-40014 Jyvaskyla, Finland.;juho.e.heikkinen@jyu.fi;;;;;;24;10;10;1;21;TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD;ABINGDON;2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND;0304-3797;1469-5898;;EUR J ENG EDUC;Eur.

More frequently the software industry requires more skilled and qualified staff; however at the university level students are young, inexperienced, and relatively homogeneous in background and abilities. This article describes an approach that integrates a student teamwork methodology (TSPi) and project-based learning (PBL) to improve software project managerial skills in undergraduate students. As complementary support, a computational tool, the Teamwork Platform for Software Engineering Education, has been developed to establish an interactive software engineering course with local software industry collaboration.

This paper presents a model of team dynamics adapted to the specificities of SE project teams. The taxonomy is composed of nine episodes that are likely to be found in any software team process. Each episode is described in terms of the input-process-output cycle and illustrated with examples. The measurability of the episodes is validated on a capstone student project carried out with an industrial partner. The team activities are recorded by each developer, throughout the project's duration, in the form of work tokens. These work tokens are then associated with episodes by two independent coders. The results show that all the episodes of the proposed taxonomy are measurable, and very few (less than 5% in this field study) remain ambiguous. Most of the ambiguities arise from short episodes that alternate during team process activities. This paper's contribution to software team process research is to synthesize the team literature and draw up a theoretically driven taxonomy of team dynamics specific to SE teams and to provide initial evidence of measurability of the taxonomy.

Previous studies on MF have shown the technical benefits of monitoring student work and product quality. This study investigated the approach further, from the perspective of team management. The effects of MF were examined through an experiment with team-related hypotheses.

Although both emphasise interactive participation, somewhat surprisingly, they do not readily support bond creating and motivating collaborative learning opportunities. Providing project-based learning and team formation services in Open Learning Environment can overcome these shortcomings. The differences between Open Learning Environments and formal learning settings, in particular with respect to scale and the amount and types of data available on the learners, suggest the development of automated services for the initiation of project-based learning and team formation. Based on current theory on project-based learning and team formation, a team formation process model is presented for the initiation of projects and team formation. The data it uses is classified into the categories ""knowledge"", ""personality"" and ""preferences"". By varying the required levels of inter-member fit on knowledge and personality, the team formation process can favour different teamwork outcomes, such as facilitating learning, creative problem solving or enhancing productivity. The approach receives support from a field survey. The survey also revealed that in every-day teaching practice in project-based learning settings team formation theory is little used and that project team formation is often left to learner self-selection. Furthermore, it shows that the data classification we present is valued differently in literature than in daily practice. The opportunity to favour different team outcomes is highly appreciated, in particular with respect to facilitating learning.

Industrial and organizational psychologists study teams in the industry settings for which we prepare students, yet this research does not effectively inform engineering education. Purpose This research review sought to demonstrate the relevance of literature on teams literature from industrial and organizational psychology to engineering education and to identify implications for practice and future directions for research. Scope/Method Phase 1 systematically reviewed 104 articles published from 2007 to 2012 describing engineering and computer science student team projects and sought to answer the following questions: What professional learning outcomes have been met by team projects? What negative student team behaviors have faculty sought to minimize? What literature has been used to inform development of teamwork outcomes? Phase 2 reviewed five team effectiveness constructs selected according to the results of Phase 1: social loafing, interdependence, conflict, trust, and shared mental models. Examples from Phase 1 articles and our own work explain how this research informs facilitation and assessment of engineering student teams. Conclusions Engineering faculty sought to achieve a variety of outcomes through team projects, including teamwork, communication, sustainability, and consideration of global/societal design context. They sought to avoid social loafing and conflict while building trust to ensure equal team effort.

To overcome the problem of the limited teaching resources, electronic resources can help students to engage in self-learning more easily. This study addresses electronic resources usage in problem-based learning. Therefore, the aim of this article is to investigate the relationship between the capability to use electronic resources and problem-based learning performance. A quantitative analysis was conducted through the structural equation modeling approach in order to indicate the direction and relationship between these constructs. To conclude, this study suggests that tutor support, peer participation, and internet search capability should be conceptualized as forming part of an important learning context.

Among many schools' SE curricula, senior projects serve as a capstone course that provides comprehensive training in collaborative project development. With the focus on collaboration training, instructors of senior projects often address issues that include how to encourage collaboration and ensure that collaborative efforts are sustained throughout the project's development. In order to help resolve these issues, the MFS takes a holistic approach. The meetings-flow concept that undergirds the MFS introduces a novel macro-level and meeting-oriented group process to guide the proceeding of the project's collaborative work. The design of the MFS facilitates a computerized environment that helps to institutionalize and monitor such a group process. In introducing the MFS, we focus initially on the elaboration of the concept and design, after which we present and validate the system implementation and usage. We also evaluate the MFS and receive a positive result with respect to the educational issues raised in this paper. Finally, we comparatively summarize the MFS to discuss its values and the role it plays in CSCL (computer supported collaborative learning) and PBL (project-based learning) of SE education.

Senior projects, which often feature industrial involvement, serve the function of a 'capstone course' in SE curricula, by offering comprehensive training in collaborative software development. Given the characteristics of student team projects and the social aspects of software development, instructional issues in such a course must include: how to encourage teamwork, how to formalize and streamline stakeholder participation, and how to monitor students' work, as well as sustain their desired collaborative effort throughout the development. In this paper, we present an exploratory study which highlights a particular case and introduces the meetings-flow approach.
