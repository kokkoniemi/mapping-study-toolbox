These systems are integrated into several software development platforms (including GitLab and GitHub) which support additional software engineering functionalities. Using these platforms in an educational context allows students to gain skills relevant to industry, whilst providing a means of keeping track of their activities. In this paper, we investigate the effect of presenting teams of students with GitLab metrics about their performance at coursework consultation sessions (checkpoint sessions), with a particular focus on the number of issues assigned and completed, and the number of commits made to the repository. A comparative analysis of project marks in two consecutive academic years indicates that these checkpoint sessions may lead to better student outcomes. An interview study with students and teaching assistants identified viewing the GitLab metrics in the checkpoints as an opportunity to see the relative contributions of team members and address resulting issues, and as a catalyst for improving engagement with the team project. The study also identified drawbacks of using the metrics too simplistically, and suggested that it was important to consider the quality and amount of written code, as well as the number of times someone committed to the repository. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.","Elsevier Inc.","J Syst Software",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85084171536

Accordingly, the use of IoT in new agronomic practices might be a vital part for improving soil quality, optimising water usage, or improving the environment. Nonetheless, the implementation of IoT systems to foster environmental awareness in educational settings is still unexplored. This work addresses the educational need to train students on how to design complex sensor-based IoT ecosystems. Hence, a Project-Based-Learning approach is followed to explore multidisciplinary learning processes implementing IoT systems that varied in the sensors, actuators, microcontrollers, plants, soils and irrigation system they used. Three different types of planters were implemented, namely, hydroponic system, vertical garden, and rectangular planters. This work presents three key contributions that might help to improve teaching and learning processes. First, a holistic architecture describing how IoT ecosystems can be implemented in higher education settings is presented. Second, the results of an evaluation exploring teamwork performance in multidisciplinary groups is reported. Third, alternative initiatives to promote environmental awareness in educational contexts (based on the lessons learned) are suggested. The results of the evaluation show that multidisciplinary work including students from different expertise areas is highly beneficial for learning as well as on the perception of quality of the work obtained by the whole group. These conclusions rekindle the need to encourage work in multidisciplinary teams to train engineers for Industry 4.0 in Higher Education. © 2020 by the authors.

Gamification is among the new training methodologies, which is a didactic approach based on the game structure with an attractive component for students. Within gamification, flipped learning and problem-based learning, escape rooms can be found as a technical aspect, which is focused on providing enigmas and tracks for the various educational content that students have assimilated through learning based on problem solving. The aim of this study is to identify how the use of gamification with the use of educational escape rooms affects activation and absence of a negative effect on students. 61 Master students of the Autonomous City of Ceuta participated in this case study. They were divided into three study groups (1 control group; 2 experimental groups) that followed different formative actions (control group—traditional; experimental groups—escape rooms). To achieve the objectives, a mixed research design based on quantitative and qualitative techniques was followed. The instrument used for data collection was the GAMEX (Gameful Experience Scale). The results reveal that the students who had taken a gamified formative action through escape rooms obtained better assessment results in the indicators concerning motivation, teamwork, commitment, activation, and absence of a negative effect on the learning process than those with the traditional methodology. © 2020 by the authors.

There is little research that has studied interactivity in online PBL settings through the lens of Social Network Analysis (SNA) to explore both student and teacher factors that could help monitor and possibly proactively support PBL groups. This study adopts SNA to investigate how groups, tutors and individual student's interactivity variables correlate with group performance and whether the interactivity variables could be used to predict group performance. Methods: We do so by analyzing 60 groups' work in 12 courses in dental education (598 students). The interaction data were extracted from a Moodle-based online learning platform to construct the aggregate networks of each group. SNA variables were calculated at the group level, students' level and tutor's level. We then performed correlation tests and multiple regression analysis using SNA measures and performance data. Results: The findings demonstrate that certain interaction variables are indicative of a well-performing group; particularly the quantity of interactions, active and reciprocal interactions among students, and group cohesion measures (transitivity and reciprocity). A more dominating role for teachers may be a negative sign of group performance. Finally, a stepwise multiple regression test demonstrated that SNA centrality measures could be used to predict group performance. A significant equation was found, F (4, 55) = 49.1, p < 0.01, with an R2 of 0.76. Tutor Eigen centrality, user count, and centralization outdegree were all statistically significant and negative. However, reciprocity in the group was a positive predictor of group improvement. Conclusions: The findings of this study emphasized the importance of interactions, equal participation and inclusion of all group members, and reciprocity and group cohesion as predictors of a functioning group. Furthermore, SNA could be used to monitor online PBL groups, identify important quantitative data that helps predict and potentially support groups to function and co-regulate, which would improve the outcome of interacting groups in PBL. The information offered by SNA requires relatively little effort to analyze and could help educators get valuable insights about their groups and individual collaborators. © 2020 The Author(s).","BioMed Central Ltd.","BMC Med.

For a team to work well towards achieving project objectives, it is important that there is effective team communication. Conventionally, face-to-face interactions allow students to interact with each other in multiple communication channels, simultaneously sending and receiving verbal and nonverbal messages in real time. Today, modern mobile technology offers students a variety of alternative digital communication media for collaboration. Unlike a full-channel communication medium such as the face-to-face interaction, a digital communication medium like instant messaging does not normally transmit nonverbal cues. As a result, to compensate for insufficient nonverbal cues, users of instant messaging services have to put more effort and time into understanding each other. If more effort and time is required to understand each other better, then why is it that today’s students prefer instant messaging to face-to-face interactions for collaborative project work? To answer this question, this study conducted a questionnaire survey to collect responses from university students who have been involved in team projects. This study analysed students’ copresence (a second-order formative construct consisting of two first-order constructs: self-copresence and partner-copresence) and its relationships with media satisfaction and communication effectiveness. It investigated whether these relationships differed between the students who used instant messaging and those who used face-to-face interactions. In addition, this study also examined whether media satisfaction played a mediating role between copresence and communication effectiveness. The findings of this study could help explain how different communication media can facilitate teamwork in collaborative learning environments. © The Author(s) 2020.","SAGE Publications Inc.","E-Learning Digit.

These include, a lack of inspiring female role-models, limited exposure of girls to science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) subjects, gender-biased stereotypes, and preferences for different learning styles between genders. Dedicated to the ideas of women and space, the “She Space” research project for high school girls was a joint effort of the Earth and Planetary Image Facility (EPIF) at Ben-Gurion University in the Negev and Beit Yatziv. The participants included 20 high-school aged female students and a predominantly female staff of up to eight university researchers and advanced degree students. The goal of this project was to advance and support female students engaging with various scientific fields and, in particular, the field of space science. The project emphasized the quality and development of the research process and used project-based learning to help participants learn to use a research-based approach when encountering challenging scientific concepts or subjects. This, together with active learning and teamwork was set as the educational framework to meet the different learning styles and motivational needs of girls. Furthermore, special attention was given to the suppression of gender stereotypes by 1) introducing women role models 2) overcoming self-induced prejudices related to STEM abilities by introducing new and unknown subjects (remote sensing), about which participants lack preconceptions. Using participant surveys, we found that self-reported confidence with and interest in STEM subjects increased after the project. We also found that participants’ feelings about participating in an all-female program did not noticeably change after the program. However, the vast majority (87%) of participants did report that having a majority female staff was very important to them. © 2019 IAA","Elsevier Ltd","Acta Astronaut",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85076685051

To close this gap, this paper aims to investigate the direct effects of team reflection on team performance over time, as well as indirect effects because of the development of similar and accurate team mental models to explain this relationship. Design/methodology/approach: Within a longitudinal experimental study on 22 student project teams working on a complex problem-solving task, the effects of repeated team reflection interventions on the development of team performance and team mental models over six measuring times were analysed. Findings: Results show that team reflections caused significant increases in team performance and team mental models over time. Results also provide evidence that team mental models’ quality mediates the effects of team reflections on team performance. Research limitations/implications: The results are interesting for both research fields, team reflection and team mental models, as the findings indicate the merits of recurrent reflection for improving team mental models’ quality. Practical implications: For organisational practice, the question of how reflection processes can be deliberately triggered in teams and effectively integrated into the daily routine should be considered. Originality/value: The findings accentuate the role of team reflections for improving team performance team mental models over time. By continuous reflecting teams increase awareness and insights into effective team processes and strategies (i.e. shared and accurate team mental models), which lead to better performance. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Emerald Group Publishing Ltd.","Team Perform.

With collected knowledge from the field study, we choose three XP processes to augment the design of a mature software engineering project course. We choose processes that are 1) considered important by professionals, and 2) complete with respect to coverage of the taxonomy's main categories.We then compare the augmented course design with the original design in a case study. Our results suggest that 1) even without extra resources, adding these new processes does not interfere with learning opportunities for XP processes previously existing in the course design; 2) student teams experience similar benefits from these new processes as professional teams do, and students appreciate the usefulness and value of the processes. In other words, our approach allows instructors to make conscious choices of XP processes that improve student learning outcomes while exposing students to a more complete set of processes and thus preparing them better for professional careers.

Background: Internships and capstone projects are widely used to integrate work-related learning in computer engineering curricula. Both activities offer numerous benefits for students, industry, and academia. Although their effects have been extensively studied separately, the interaction between them remains unexplored. Research Questions: What is the effect of internships on the development of a subsequent capstone project? Methodology: The hypothesis was that the completion of an internship will have positive effects on several aspects of the capstone projects: 1) improved student competencies; 2) improved capstone project outcomes; and 3) decreased supervision effort. Further, these positive effects were expected to be greater in industry-based projects than in academic projects. The hypothesis was tested through a quantitative study of data collected from 274 computer science engineering capstone projects. A period of time with internships was compared with another period without internships, and differentiating between academic and industry projects. Findings: Internships prior to capstone projects improve student skills in autonomy, technology, methodology, and project management; increase the complexity and technological novelty of the resulting projects; and reduce advisor involvement in practical (technology, execution) and keep-the-project-alive issues, and increase advisor involvement in monitoring student work (meetings, reports, and initial arrangements). This effect was observed in both industrial and academic projects. © 1963-2012 IEEE.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","IEEE Trans Educ",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85070375099

The current study demonstrates that VR and 3D prototyping in the context of project-based learning (PBL) promote effective communication, increase problem solving skills, and enhance learning outcomes. VR and digital prototyping have been extensively used in industries for the purpose of product design and usability evaluation. In the context of engineering education, many research studies have attempted to explore the effect of VR on teamwork, engagement, retention, and motivation. In this paper, VR is used in conjunction with PBL in self-directed approach to design and implement a product using 3D software whilst also using virtual reality immersive CAVE display to evaluate their design. The hypothesis is that the use of VR with a project-based-learning approach to facilitate the attainment of desirable goals in the engineering design project, improved achievement of course learning outcomes and promoted effective communication. According to the research findings, VR approach significantly affected the distribution of cumulative project grades. Students’ project grades improved, particularly the implementation component.

As web-based technologies are becoming prominent in higher education, there is a need to examine this effect among students working in online learning environments. Hence, this study was set to characterize team diversity of science and engineering students, and identify factors that might predict innovation in team projects conducted in different learning environments. This study was carried out in the settings of a nanotechnology course, delivered both on-campus and as a massive open online course (MOOC). The study compared between three groups of learners: face-to-face (F2F) university students (n = 103), online university students (n = 108), and MOOC learners (n = 109). The number of participants in each group is derived from the number of team projects that were submitted and analyzed. Applying a quasi-experimental research design, data were collected via a survey and analysis of projects' innovation. Findings showed that diversity in ‘academic discipline’ and ‘academic level’ were positive predictors of project innovation, in all three groups. Diversity in ‘mother tongue’ was found as a positive predictor of innovation for the face-to-face university students, but as a negative predictor for both online groups.

These projects require significant collaboration and, as such, the project's success is largely dependent on the students' teamwork. This work presents an exploratory study of capstone design teams in a large engineering school in Canada. The goal of the study was to draw valuable insights about the teamwork experiences, skills and gaps of students in capstone design teams. These insights will support evidence-based development and improvement of teamwork training for engineering students. The study was conducted in two phases. First, semi-structured interviews with 12 instructors of capstone design courses solicited their perspectives on students' capstone design teams. Findings from the instructor interviews and related literature were used to design a student survey. The survey was administered to more than six hundred fourth-year engineering students to further explore capstone design teams' dynamics.Wecollected information on students' team formation, distribution of tasks and roles in teams, project management methods used, and the different types of conflicts experienced. In addition, we investigated the potential links between those variables and team effectiveness and enjoyment. In general, our results provide strong evidence that having clear roles, a high degree of a match between students' interests and skills with their assigned tasks, similar expectations about the outcomes, a clear project management plan, and lower levels of conflicts in student teams are significantly correlated with perceived team effectiveness and enjoyment. We discuss the implications of our findings for targeted instructional interventions on required teamwork skills for students. © 2020 TEMPUS Publications.","Tempus Publications","Int. J. Eng.

Hence, there is an evident need for developing life-long learning skills and particularly in fostering self-regulation of learning in engineering programmes. Project-Based Learning (PjBL) is a teaching pedagogy that supports the development of intellectual skills and autonomy through self-regulation. Individual self-regulation of learning has been studied over the years in a range of education situations [7,14]. As teamwork becomes commonplace in education, the need to study team regulation has become apparent and models that include social and cognitive processes during teamwork have emerged [2]. However, new empirical evidence is still required to develop models of shared regulation in groups. This study builds on the body of empirical evidence about shared regulation focusing on Project-Based Learning environments. It investigates how teams of engineering students actually develop shared team regulation and how this is related to individuals' self-regulation. The study uses data from students' project meetings during a one-semester long project as part of a Chemical Process design course. As the emphasis of the study is in describing and analysing how shared regulation takes place within a group context, focusing the attention on verbal and non-verbal mechanisms as indicators of shared regulation displayed by the students; naturalistic data of teams of students are gathered while carrying out PjBL meetings (~5) via video recording (~10 hours). Transcripts of conversations/actions are coded in the first instance to describe what takes place and then to support the analysis. These data enable the identification of elements of regulatory behaviour as displayed through language. © 2020 SEFI 47th Annual Conference: Varietas Delectat...

As a result, there is a need to develop teamwork competence in related activities such as, software engineering education. In higher education educational settings, courses often propose several tools for student groups to either guide or support their work. In this paper, authors present main results and lessons learned from courses on software engineering. Specifically, the aim of this paper is the study of the selection and the adoption of software engineering tools by students working in teams, in the context of a software engineering course. The purpose of the study is analysing the students' decision making process and reasoning strategies to such selection. In this scenario, driven by a project based learning approach, a qualitative study on the use of specific tools to support group work was conducted. Results reveal that students demonstrate a rational decision making process based on logical efficient reasoning. As consequence six lessons have been learned: everything in one place; the new over the known; freedom over imposition; performance and freedom; social influence and secondary role of project management. In addition, these six lessons have been compared with previous literature in the topic and backing them up with main theories in the field. Finally, authors reflect on the implications of such lessons learned analyzing deeply aspects like freedom of choice, performance, tools features, imposition and social influence, to bring a set of grounded argumentations to the reader. © 2020 TEMPUS Publications.","Tempus Publications","Int.

Based on this premise, the present work focuses its research on the design, implementation and assessment of a methodological change applied in the Final Degree Project (FDP) of Building and Construction Engineering degree, going from being an individual work to a teamwork. It has been demonstrated, how main specific competences required by professional sector are properly worked and validated in the design of the current curricula and in the FDP development.

This is partly due to the lack of a framework that supports the considerations for affordances and product semantics during the design process. As a consequence, many designers rely on their own intuition, and this can be problematic. To avoid the potential negative effects of relying on intuition, we designed a framework to support the designer in explicitly considering affordances and applying product semantics during product design.

In this context, the shared e-leadership approach is determined to be useful especially in terms of fostering the sense of belonging to the group by sharing the leadership role within the group, ensuring a fair distribution of responsibility and workload among the group members. The vertical e-leadership approach was found to be useful in providing communication, cooperation and coordination among the group members thanks to the group leader, ensuring the planned progress of the group works. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Springer","J.

Research, however, has shown that graduates still fall short of the expectations of industry. These deficiencies are not limited to technical shortcomings. The ever changing landscape of 'lean' enterprise software development requires engineers to be equipped with abilities beyond the technical. How can higher education help students become great software developers in this context? As a first step towards answering this question, we present the results of a systematic literature review, focusing on noncognitive abilities, better known as 'soft skills'. Our results identify self-reflection, conflict resolution, communication, and teamwork as the top four taught skills. Internships and capstone projects require more attention as a teaching aspect to facilitate the learning of multiple skills, including creativity. Interdisciplinary teaching and group composition are other important factors that influence learning. By providing novel insights on relationships between noncognitive abilities and teaching aspects, this work contributes to the continuous improvement of software engineering curricula. These findings may also serve as a springboard for further investigation of certain undervalued skills. © 2020 SEFI 47th Annual Conference: Varietas Delectat...

However, past research has identified that working with other students online has the potential to cause anxiety for learners, particularly when work is being assessed. There is concern that, as well as the emotional distress this may cause, anxiety may affect students' participation and performance in these activities. This paper investigates these issues by exploring part-time distance learners' experiences of a group project where they were required to collaborate online to create a wiki resource and a website. An online survey and interviews were conducted with students who had recently completed the project. Results revealed that anxiety was commonly experienced, and causes of anxiety included relying on ‘unknown others’, fear of negative evaluation, and worries about non-active group members. It was found that anxiety reduced over the course of the project, as feelings of uncertainty were resolved. Findings also revealed that, although anxiety is often viewed to have detrimental consequences, more learners perceived anxiety to have had a facilitative effect on participation and performance than a debilitative one. Students who employed problem-focused coping strategies, rather than avoidance coping ones, were more likely to experience facilitative effects. These findings will be of value to educators who are designing and running online collaborative activities, and students who are participating in them. © 2019","Elsevier Ltd","Comput Educ",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85071884263

The author of this paper has previously examined such analogies critically in connection with his own research concerning the actual patterns of decision-making in a music performance. One conclusion from this research is that these patterns are, to a large extent, generalizable to decision-making in other group contexts. At the same time, however, analogies always “hide” and “highlight” certain aspects of what they are meant to say something about (to repurpose vocabulary from George Lakoff & Mark Johnson's Metaphors We Live By [1]). Exploring the limits of an analogy may consequently lead to a clearer idea of the special traits of each of the two compared entities. This paper uses the critical examination of an analogy between a small music ensemble (such as a rock band) and a team of engineering students to emphasize where the two fundamentally differ in their decision-making patterns. At a first glance, the way musicians base their actions in a performance on a combination of goals (broadly construed), expectations for the actions of others, internalized routines, and prior communication with exact agreements, is very close to that of a team of engineering students. Where the two differ is especially in the way goals emerge and are negotiated in a group. Engineering processes tend to be problem-based, and problems can be discussed differently (and often more constructively) than a musical idea. © 2020 SEFI 47th Annual Conference: Varietas Delectat...

To respond, in recent years, inclusive reforms are being implemented to adopt Outcome-Based Education (OBE) approach and transform engineering education in India. The 12 Program Outcomes (POs) defined by NBA guides for development, execution & delivery of curriculum, evaluation of student learning and performance at various levels. The scope of mechatronics subject at colleges affiliated to Savitribai Phule Pune University (SPPU) in 2015 course was mostly restricted to theoretical and study approach, which do not exhibit involvement of students in creative, inventive and innovative thinking. This motivates to adopt Project Based Learning (PBL) at undergraduate level. Three large classes of 70+ students are grouped in to 3-5 students per batch. Project phases are defined; direct and indirect assessments are mapped with outcomes and it is carried out using pre-and post-intervention survey of students. It is observed that, the presented PBL framework has served as an efficient pedagogy. This approach not only ensured holistic development, teamwork, sustainability, improved higher-order cognitive skills, learning ability, soft skills, self-efficacy and communication but also accumulated near about 60 innovative prototypes in a mechatronics laboratory. It is projected that, PBL could enable students to acquire lifelong learning to tackle new difficulties arise in corporate/non-corporate life, thinking on future modification, filing a patent, converting prototype into commercial product. © 2019, Rajarambapu Institute Of Technology.

The study attempts to expand the existing literature on integrated design and construction education and offer an alternative model for academic students’ collaboration when restructuring curriculums is not possible in the short term. Design/methodology/approach: The study adopted a qualitative research methodology, which involved designing a structured learning experiment, then followed it with collecting the “lived experience” of 31 participants from three majors according to the institution’s institution review board (IRB) office’s guidelines. The author hypothesized that students from different, but related disciplines working on a real-life project, would better understand the value of each other’s knowledge brought to the teamwork before graduation. The data were analyzed and compared to existing literature on integrated project delivery, and collaborative learning models. Data collection (surveys) was approved by the higher education’s IRB No. 13-021. Findings: Despite the already-existing curriculum obstacles, the majority of students were very pleased with this collaborative experiment. The results confirmed many of the expectations about how students viewed each other’s discipline. The preconceived notions were dissipated at the end of the study, and students expressed more appreciation for each other’s field and expressed interest in learning more about the thought processes of other disciplines. Research limitations/implications: Typical conflicting academic schedules were the greatest obstacle in this experiment. Architecture students often devote majority of their time to design studios and therefore are unable to fully engage in an integrated capstone project like this one as extracurricular. Because of the chosen research approach, the research results may lack generalizability. Therefore, researchers are encouraged to test the proposed propositions further. Practical implications: It is possible to develop a successful collaborative experience in the architecture, engineering and construction higher education system without major restructuring of the curriculums. The impact on students’ learning experience is greater than the existing separated education model. Originality/value: This paper fulfills an identified need to study how integrated design and construction education occurs without creating new dedicated programs or coursework. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Emerald Group Publishing Ltd.","Eng.

The adoption of the PBL approach has been growing in computer education, where problem-solving and group work are essential. Despite the compatibility and benefits of PBL, some challenges remain, in particular, with respect to the assessment process. For an effective assessment process, it needs to be well defined and managed by both teachers and students themselves, considering that, in PBL, the students are at the center of the teaching and learning process, they are active, and self-regulating. In this context, this paper proposes an interface for student progress monitoring (a 'student board') based on an authentic assessment model called PBL-SEE. Constructed using the Design Science Research (DSR) method, this interface was initially prototyped and validated by PBL specialists. The results showed a good acceptance of the student board and important recommendations for improvements. © 2019 IEEE.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","Proc. Front. Educ.

There are many examples of agile methods taught in, for instance, capstone courses in software engineering programmes. It has been shown to be a popular and beneficial method of learning. However, most agile teams in the software industry are made up of members with different educational backgrounds (i.e. not just software developers, as there will also business analysts, designers, testers etc.). Such a diversity of roles might be beneficial in teaching agile methods in an academic setting.This reflective educational paper describes the evolution of an industry sourced problem-based agile student project, which over three successive years has included students from three different faculties. Although the experience has broadly been positive each year, this paper describes and reflects on both the good and problematic observations that the teaching staff has made over the years. The changes of the projects has been based by reflecting on these insights. These reflections are described and several recommendations are drawn from the experiences.These include, that it is important that the cohorts collaborate and work together in parallel. Individual groups, of diverse cohorts, should work in isolation. It is important to have industrial partners who are participating actively in the process, and it is important to not underestimate the work that is required by the academics to coordinate the projects to make them successful. © 2019 IEEE.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","Proc.

Proponents of the problem-based learning model argue that by providing authentic, real-world problems in a peer-supported group setting, learners are better able to apply their knowledge after graduation. Studies have shown that problem-based learning affords students advantages such as increased motivation, teamwork skills, improved critical thinking abilities, increased knowledge retention, and better organization and integration of new knowledge. Critics of problem-based learning argue that the model adds additional burdens on instructors and negatively affects the amount of knowledge gained (facts), which in turn leads to lower test scores. This paper seeks to explain the characteristics of the problem-based learning model and examine its merits and limitations. An examination of past and future progression of this model will also be undertaken.

The capstone experience in mechanical engineering at the University of Maine consists of a senior year, 2 semester 7ch sequence, where student teams design, build and test a mechanical device. It not only constitutes the culmination of the plan of study, but also represents a signature component of the curriculum and student experience in the department due to its intensive nature that includes the construction and testing of the project. In the past, and due to stagnant teaching capacity coupled with high student growth in the major, the aim had been to streamline the implementation by increasingly standardizing the experience and assessment around a common land-drone theme. However, a recent change and expansion of the instructor team to two faculty members, combined with the necessity to improve the assessment of the ABET outcomes linked to the course, motivated the transformation of the sequence presented here. This transformation has included the development of a robust and transparent assessment system that incorporates both formative and summative feedback modes including continuous peer evaluation, as well as an active outward-opening of the projects to research entities on and off-campus as well as industry. Initial results indicate an almost three-fold increase in externally sponsored projects, as well as the successful assessment of the learning outcomes as evidenced by ABET and anonymous student surveys that support the perception of the system being capable of fair and transparent allocation of individual grades in a team environment. © 2019 IEEE.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","Proc.

Forming student teams that are more likely to be successful is a goal of every teacher or instructor using teams as a part of their pedagogy. CATME is a team formation and team management website tool. It contains team formation, peer evaluation and teamwork training tools to help an instructor make and manage student teams. CATME's team building algorithms include validated teamwork research with practical constraints provided by instructors.CATME's Team-Maker algorithm uses a heuristic score based on instructor-determined criteria to form teams that optimize the student team composition. The tool includes 20 built-in questions for the instructor to choose from with the option to create individual questions. One question type not accounted for in the current CATME algorithm is a preference ranking question.Augmenting the Team-Maker algorithm to include student project preference as a part of the heuristic score will ease the time struggle of instructors while still forming well-balanced groups. Given that the problem at hand is very similar to the stable marriage problem, the Gale-Shapely algorithm was determined as the best possible options. The Gale-Shapley algorithm, better known for its implementation in the Medical Residency Matching Program, matches entities based on ranked preference lists. Once the algorithm terminates, no two unmatched resident/residency entities prefer each other over their current assignment.This paper documents the testing of the Gale-Shapley algorithm, illustrating methods to use student/instructor/ sponsor ranked preference lists for project selections. These techniques will be used to form teams in the 2018/2019 academic year and results included in final paper versions. © 2019 IEEE.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","Proc.

However, the curriculum guidelines of the ACM/IEEE and Brazilian Computer Society emphasize the need of providing students with sufficient practical experiences for the development of competences expected for SE professional. Student-centered and learn-by-doing approaches, such as Project-Based Learning (PBL), have been advocated as suited for the development of competences. These approaches aim to promote higher motivation for the learner, a more active role in the learning process, and better learning in the application level. The goal of this paper is to evaluate the students' perception on the adoption of PBL in SE education. To achieve this goal, we performed a long-term study spanning for about 2 years. This study includes a survey to collect responses of 32 undergraduate students enrolled in an introductory SE course that used PBL. We compare the results to the responses of 17 students who participated in a SE course with similar syllabus but with a traditional teacher-centered learning method (non-PBL). Our results show a positive reception of the PBL method, and an increased perception of the contribution of a practical software development assignment in learning specific SE topics in the context of the PBL course, in comparison to a non-PBL method. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.","Association for Computing Machinery","ACM Int.

The 18-week course plan created in this research features the context of Industry 4.0. A total of 48 participants were enrolled in the course and divided into groups each of which was expected to develop a thematic project. To provide a holistic understanding of the CPS approach’s influence on students’ creativity, the present research applied a mixed methodology, which included survey questionnaires (team cohesion questionnaire), creativity measurement (creativity test), as well as semi-structured interviews. Descriptive statistics, t-test and Pearson product-moment correlation were adopted to analyze the quantitative results. Qualitative contents of semi-structured interviews were used to support the quantitative data. The results showed that the engineering college students had a significant improvement between their pre-test score on creativity and their post-test score. Furthermore, a significant change in students’ types of creative thinking was also found in terms of their innovative creativity. Besides, interviews with student participants echoed with the quantitative results and showed preferences among students toward certain types of creativity. The qualitative results reveal how some students praised the benefits of the CPS steps as well as those of creative thinking techniques taught in class, how some of them also pointed out the difficulties and reasons that might have influenced their development of a team project, and how the same challenges caused them to struggle with creative thinking and the maintenance of team cohesion. Finally, the research results are summarized and limitations are acknowledged to engage instructors and future studies in a discussion about the implementation of creative training among students and about how it may facilitate their creative thinking. © 2019, National Taiwan Normal University.

In this paper, I review the main features of project-based learning, the advantages it offers to higher education, and the main challenges that its successful implementation faces. On the basis of a synthesis between theoretical and practical knowledge, I present and demonstrate ways for integrating the project-based learning principles with available information and communications technologies, and offer implementation guidelines for lecturers and institutions of higher education. © 2019 by authors, all rights reserved.","Horizon Research Publishing","Univers.

However, little knowledge currently exists on how to provide useful and tangible tools that could help software developers and designers implement ethical considerations into practice. In this paper, we empirically evaluate a method that enables ethically aligned design in a decision-making process. Though this method, titled the RESOLVEDD strategy, originates from the field of business ethics, it is being applied in other fields as well. We tested the RESOLVEDD strategy in a multiple case study of five student projects where the use of ethical tools was given as one of the design requirements. A key finding from the study indicates that simply the presence of an ethical tool has an effect on ethical consideration, creating more responsibility even in instances where the use of the tool is not intrinsically motivated. © 2019 IEEE.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","Proc. - Euromicro Conf.

This paper describes this approach, and an evaluation strategy using Perry's model for intellectual development. The results show that students can reach the relativism stage of Perry's model in their first year of studies. Background: Students must move beyond a dualistic worldview to be engineers. Felder and Brent provided a list of recommendations to promote this type of intellectual development in students; active learning strategies strongly align with these recommendations. While active learning is common in programming courses (sometimes taking the form of project-based learning), they are typically tightly controlled by the instructor, and limited in scope (both in time and complexity), potentially reducing their impact on students. Intended Outcomes: This course and term-long project provided students a supportive environment in which to develop their decision-making skills, and promoted their intellectual development through Perry's stages related to software design. Application Design: Aligned with Felder and Brent's recommendations and Kuh's High Impact Practices, a course was built to: 1) teach students procedural programming, with 2) a focus on software design and open-ended problem solving, while maintaining 3) a supportive environment for skill acquisition. Findings: A mixed methods study showed the majority of students align themselves with the relativism stage of intellectual development at the end of the course. This study also illuminated the decision-making processes of teams of students in a first-year software design course. © 1963-2012 IEEE.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","IEEE Trans Educ",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85067828550

WebQuest is a web-based learning model that is derived from Web 1.0 to help students to learn. However, with today’s advances in internet-based learning and the evolution from Web 2.0 to Web 5.0 applications, which have been widely adopted, new web-based learning models are necessary. Learning in a sheltered online scaffolding environment (SOSE) consists of three main stages: a preparation stage including task exploration and information collection; a data refinement stage including refining data and extracting evidence and findings; and a cooperation and publishment stage including decision-making, final agreement and publishing. The theoretical bases of the suggested model basically rely on six main educational theories and approaches: web-based learning, constructivist theory, scaffolding strategies, project-based learning, inquiry-based learning, discovery learning, problem-based learning and active learning. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Springer New York LLC","Educ.

Many positive aspects were highlighted such as peer learning and improvements in problem-solving, project management and task priority analysis. However, this hackathon phenomena is something that is happening outside the curriculum, with scarce reports of teachers taking advantage of similar approaches in undergraduate courses. In this article, we present our experience of an undergraduate introductory course on Distributed Systems where students have to participate in a ""hack day"" at the end of the semester. The goal is to take advantage of the hackathon model to bring a more realistic and engaging scenario where students can develop their course project and put into practice what they have learned in the semester. With this model, they have to do face-to-face group work and also have the opportunity to share knowledge with other groups. Our experience indicates positive results with this approach. Students reported a high level of engagement and enthusiasm. There were different situations of peer learning being reported, and according to their perception, students felt they learned more in the hack day than in lectures or laboratory practice. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.","Association for Computing Machinery","Annu.

Project-Based Learning (PBL), Scrum and rapid prototyping are utilized to support student projects over the three years. Students developed a number of prototypes for various IoT domains related to ongoing research projects within our research center. The results show that students could easily use their JavaScript knowledge for any type of IoT development.

Its perceived educational value is exemplified by its explicit mention in ABET's Criterion 5, which requires engineering programs to provide a culminating design experience that incorporates engineering standards and multiple constraints. Capstone courses and design-build-test projects allow students to synthesize and apply engineering knowledge, skills, and tools to open-ended design problems. Students work and communicate in teams to complete tasks like generating requirements, and testing and integrating equipment. There appears to be widespread consensus that project-based learning is valuable, but, how well do these projects prepare students for engineering challenges in professional practice? We consider one aspect of professional practice-failure. Despite many improvement efforts by organizations, systems engineering failures continue to occur. Previous research identified a set of common causes for these project failures. Does PBL provide students with opportunities to fail safely, and thereby learn to avoid failure in professional practice? We present here an approach to compare the rates of occurrence of failure causes in student team projects with industry projects. By comparing the occurrence rates, we achieve our first research goal to evaluate whether PBL offers sufficient opportunities of failure to students. Out of the ten failure causes we examined, we found that four are underrepresented in PBL, two of which are fundamentally related to systems engineering practice. Failure causes may be hard to identify without the benefit of hindsight, so, we developed a set of crowd signals that may point to their presence. We observed 18 different student design projects across two semesters. Each week, the students answered a set of questions we developed to measure these crowd signals, while the instructors directly pointed out any instances of the failure causes they observed during the students' efforts. With the availability of such data we built logistic regression models to find correlations between specific crowd signals and the occurrence of a particular failure cause. By interpreting the regression coefficients, we achieve our second research goal to suggest specific improvements that instructors can use to give their students more failure opportunities during PBL. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2019","American Society for Engineering Education","ASEE Annu.

Branch campuses are no exception in terms of assigning projects as a way to achieve learning outcomes. However, the differences arise and are more distinguishable when the cultural diversity of the student population is taken into consideration. This paper aims at forming a better understanding of engineering students' perceptions of project-based learning in the diverse context of an international branch campus located in Qatar, as well as to provide educators with suggestions on how to better manage group projects that involve a diverse population. The research project bases its results and recommendations on data taken directly from the branch campus in the form of a focus group. A diverse group of students, from different majors, genders, and classifications were involved in an open-ended discussion on their perspective and experiences with projects, and what elements of a project were the most important to them. Major findings discussed the role that the culture, of both the diverse group of students and of the physical location of the campus, plays when the students are working on projects. Students ranked teams, and their interaction with fellow team mates as the primary factor responsible for their satisfaction with the project. Other factors that influenced the perspective of the students about projects included relevance of the project to the major and the interest of the students. We also argue that cultural factors play a large role in students' perceptions of projects. Recommendations based on this will be useful for instructors working with diverse student populations on project-based learning. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2019","American Society for Engineering Education","ASEE Annu.

Given their traditional comfort with abstraction and universalization in the process of problem definition, engineering students can be challenged by the immersive problem-framing processes demanded by a contextual research design investigation [2]. Using the process of GIS site-mapping as an engagement tool may provide a strategy by which students can develop alternative methods of stakeholder engagement as part of their data gathering process and thus integrate social and community aspects into their site problem-framing in new ways. Originally designed as an experiment to explore the potential for GIS mapping as a tool for creative spatial exploration in site design, this study uncovered an unexpected additional benefit to the open-ended site analysis processes undertaken. Student focus on geo-spatial site data and generative mapping processes seems to have simultaneously, perhaps through the head-fake of indirect learning [3], enabled ways of integrating stakeholder engagement with site visualization leading to a range of creative problem framing and problem research outcomes. Taking a qualitative approach, this study analyses a graduate level Civil and Environmental engineering project-based GIS course and uses a text analysis of student interviews as well as visual analysis of student project work to extract student attitudes and approaches to site engagement. Transcribed interviews are bundled into representative issues and coded into categories by constant comparison of emergent data, using a phenomenographic educational research methodology [4]-[6]. The resultant analysis describes the variety of ways in which creative geo-spatial mapping as an instructional approach seems to enable alternative ways for students to integrate stakeholder and site engagement into their problem-framing process. Aspects such as sensations of safety, emotional connections, changing businesses and community paths made their way into students' spatial data structures, issues which otherwise might not be integrated into the engineering curriculum. Outcomes suggest that the specific effort of producing consistent creative spatial-data site visualizations of community and site issues may give students a greater depth of stakeholder understanding or needs than might have been achieved through traditional engagement processes. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2019","American Society for Engineering Education","ASEE Annu.

Creating effective teams can be a difficult task for an instructor, especially when creating them from first year students who have yet to establish preferences for work habits or teammates. In many cases, instructors of first year courses will form student teams by randomly assigning students to teams, by allowing students to self-select teammates, or, at best, by trying to optimize teams using whatever limited knowledge they have about these new students. Here, we present and analyze gruepr, a new software tool for partitioning up to 200 students into optimal project teams. The tool has been released under an open source license so that the C++ source code is freely available. The software tool runs on the instructor's computer using survey data entered by the students into, and then downloaded from, a Google Form. The instructor has considerable flexibility in choosing the content of the survey questions as well as their definition of a quantitatively optimal team. The optimization problem is computationally difficult, and the search space is immense. For example, there are over 1019 ways to partition 32 students into 8 teams of 4. Thus, manually assembling a set of teams is time consuming and highly unlikely to provide an optimal result. It is for this reason that gruepr was created. Gruepr uses a genetic algorithm to perform the optimization. In this paper, we first discuss the need for such a program, then describe how an instructor uses gruepr, then present the design of the program, and finally provide initial analysis of gruepr and results from its recent use by 6 faculty members in the formation of teams within 18 sections of a project-based, first year engineering course. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2019","American Society for Engineering Education","ASEE Annu.

We can expect that in the future, engineers work globally and change their place of residence, which means that international companies need engineers who understand the issue of working with other cultures and have worked in real world global with teammates and partners from other cultures and countries. Engineering programs in many universities include following elements in their syllabuses in order to train students as”global engineers”: • knowledge of languages and cultural skills, • teamwork and group dynamics in international teams, • knowledge of the business and engineering cultures in different countries, • knowledge of international variations in engineering education and practice. Joint students' projects (from Purdue University in USA and Technical University of Denmark in Denmark) were established to ensure acquisition of these skills and capabilities through out common real-world projects provided by industrial companies. In this paper, we describe our experiences with three industrial projects performed by students from America and Denmark during which the students dealt with international standards, adapted to working with a different culture, and applied effective project management tools. As part of these projects, the Danish students visit Purdue University early in the projects while American students went to Denmark at the end of the projects in order to present the results of their work for the companies involved. The first face-to-face visit is absolutely crucial for the development of common goals in the project, as well as in order to establish the proper communication during the entire project work. The visit is always planned in cooperation with the American team as they are the host and provide both housing and activities for the stay of Danish students. Danish students stay with a couple of the American students and their mates and spend a lot of time socializing with them. By spending all this time together both parts of the team, Americans and Danish, are able to get a better idea of culture, language and professional skills. Participating in non-professional activities creates a friendly bond in which formalities and barriers are overcomes. For the same reason, communication become easier during the entire project work.

One of the important skills for successful engineering students is their ability to work effectively in a team environment. There are many opportunities for students to participate in team-based work in various courses and capstone projects to help them practice teamwork skills. However, in many cases, students are on their own to make their teams work and these team-based activities do not necessarily allow students to develop effective teamwork abilities. At Arizona State University, two cohorts of first year engineering students took Introduction to Engineering and Small Group Communication together during Fall 2018 semester with cohered schedule, content, and assignments, around a small design challenge and a large design project. The impact of this model on team dynamics in the design projects was assessed using the CARE model and assessment tool developed by the Individual and Team Performance Lab at University of Calgary. This assessment tool contains 81 Likert Scale questions about Team Dynamics covering the following areas: strategy formulation & planning; role clarity; cooperative conflict management; team monitoring & backup; goal progression; coordination; contribution equity; healthy, fact-driven conflict; lack of personal conflict; trust; constructive controversy; exploitative learning; and exploratory learning. The experimental group consisted of two sections of the cohered courses whereas the control group involved students enrolled in four sections of the traditional Introduction to Engineering course during the same semester. This assessment tool was given to both groups three times during the semester. Overall the experimental group outperformed the control group for the majority of the questions in all three evaluations. Less personal conflict was found in the control group from the first evaluation where differences in results between the two groups were of statistical significance. Other statistically significant differences with better performance from the experimental group were found in results from areas of healthy, fact-driven conflict (first evaluation); coordination (final evaluation); and contribution equity (final evaluation). © American Society for Engineering Education, 2019","American Society for Engineering Education","ASEE Annu.

For a large STEM Capstone program in a major Midwestern university we collected peer evaluation data three times and examined both peer evaluation data and the relationships to the peer ratings of additional questions on teammates perception of psychological safety, team conflict, team cohesiveness, personal satisfaction with their team experience, and their written peer to peer comments explaining their peer ratings. We used the CATME peer evaluation system to collect the peer ratings and the additional questions data. CATME is a tool for forming and managing teams that has been used by over one million students to date. CATME's peer evaluation tool has five behaviorally anchored dimensions and additional team process measures that can be collected along with the peer evaluation data. We found strong correlations among team cohesiveness, team conflict and psychological safety questions. In addition, we developed heuristics by which problematic teams can be identified based on examining several of these team process scores simultaneously. In particular, psychological safety questions are strongly correlated negatively with team conflict feedback and positively correlated with team cohesion question feedback. These problem team indicators were strongly confirmed by the faculty mentoring our sample teams. A second useful team problem indicator was a lack of participation in the peer evaluation process. A final indicator of problematic teams was one or more low absolute levels of peer ratings for an individual team member and the nature of written peer to peer comments explaining the students' self and teammate peer ratings. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2019.","American Society for Engineering Education","ASEE Annu.

We conducted a design-based research study to investigate how an asset-mapping activity could help team members to value each other's contributions in chemical engineering design projects. As part of our ongoing effort to redesign the curriculum to better support diverse students to persist in chemical engineering, we have been guided by the notion of building on students' assets and seeing their potential, rather than focusing on their deficits [2], [3]. We extended this notion by investigating how to help students see the assets they and their teammates bring. We report on student progress in a sophomore-level material and energy balance course (n= 63 in 10 teams) and a capstone chemical engineering design course (n= 53 in 12 teams) at a large, Hispanic-serving research university in the Southwest. The sophomores had prior design experience, as they were in a cohort that began after the curriculum had been redesigned to incorporate design challenges throughout the core chemical engineering coursework. The seniors did not have prior design experience within the curriculum. Both courses stressed the importance of teamwork and engaged students in working on design challenges. Students completed a two-part activity: They first identified their own assets and the assets of their teammates. They were then guided to map the assets across their team members and critically evaluate areas of strength and weakness. To aid them on the second portion, we provided a list of specific skills valued in professional engineering practice. In this paper, we focus on professional communication, project management, and interpersonal / teamwork skills. We collected all student work related to the activity. We developed a coding scheme to analyze the qualitative data and conducted basic statistics (correlations and t-tests) to analyze quantitative data. The two areas that fewer students reported having skills were in project management and communication, particularly communicating outside of engineering. Overall, the sophomores tended to report similar numbers of team members with each professional skill as the seniors. Whereas the seniors could clearly distinguish between the professional skill areas, the sophomores were not adept at this. To understand the impact of the team asset-mapping activity, we compared the sophomores' scores on items from a peer evaluation conducted twice during the semester. Early in the semester, students tended to report some difficulty managing conflicts related to team tasks, but by the end of the semester, significantly fewer teams did so. We also describe an asset-based modification we made to the teams in the senior capstone class. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2019","American Society for Engineering Education","ASEE Annu.

To develop an innovation-based ecosystem, the US must produce more STEM graduates capable of driving innovation. “At the heart of an innovative local ecosystem is its capacity to absorb new knowledge for industrial use. Industrial innovation is defined by the capability and propensity to engage, translate, absorb and exploit new knowledge and the active participation of a university, including facilities, faculty, staff and students who can aid this process.” [2] In 2018, the US declined from fourth to sixth in the Global Innovation Index with the United Kingdom (fourth) and Singapore (fifth) advancing. [3] The 19 States comprising the “American Heartland” have a State Technology and Science Index (STSI) significantly below the mean for the US. And, five states in the southern Heartland are in the bottom ten for the country. [4] Research Universities can be (and are) major sources of innovation through the commercialization of their research. However, research does not need to be the only source of innovation from research universities. Innovation can also come through students by way of purposely developed or enhanced courses, pedagogy, and experiences designed to create a spark or foster an existing spark, fan the flames, and fuel them to help them grow. It is unfortunate to create the spark in first-year students and then ignore it until it is time for the senior design / capstone project; the innovators need to continue to learn, experience, and grow throughout their academic career. To be a meaningful real-world experience, an innovation concentration needs to incorporate learning and experiences within disciplines students will encounter once they have begun their professional career including: engineering (of many types); business, marketing, finance, accounting, manufacturing, supply chain, sales, and management; industrial design, architecture, science, service and support; and, an understanding of business customers and users - from first-year through to capstone. Translating this into pedagogy and curriculum means innovation-based or innovation-infused courses, problem-based and active learning-based, real-world experiences in partnership with the innovation ecosystem and a progression based on gaining knowledge, skills, and experience. And, to match the real-world, these courses need to be interdisciplinary, multi-disciplinary, transdisciplinary, and multi-college / multi-school (engineering, business, arts & sciences, architecture, etc.). Innovation is at the Venn diagram intersection of engineering, creativity and business, at the core of what is commercialized and provides the basis for entrepreneurship. Innovation is not a solution looking for a problem; it is a solution for a need. [5] Expanding and Evolving an Innovation Concentration describes our initiative to develop the concept, pedagogy, faculty, curriculum, outcomes, experience, and the students to create graduates who can engage, translate, absorb, apply critical thinking, and exploit this new knowledge of innovation, and who can innovate and experience this continuously through their academic career. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2019","American Society for Engineering Education","ASEE Annu.

PBL involves team formation where necessary skills are needed to execute the project. Traditionally, the teams were randomly allocated based on individual preferences. To cab on this issue, preference based model needs few refinements such as skills needs to be identified by the facilitator while the students provide the necessary skill data. This way, students get assigned based on their skill rather than just random allocation. In a worst case scenario for random allocation, a team can end up with a very strong team having high skills or vice versa where a team has all of its members with limited skill or few skills are missing. The group created by skill preference would allow each group to more or less have the same strength and nearly all skills would be present in a group. In this paper, a method is extended from its original to cater for other state-of-the-art optimization techniques rather than just genetic algorithm to find a method that can suit small or large dataset. The objective function takes into account the differences between the total skill set of each group with the average total skill set needed for each group and the missing skill penalty of each group is added. Missing skill penalty is incurred due to not satisfying all the constraints such as non-presence of all the skills in a group. The skill rating allows better selection of members in a software engineering course.

However, despite the many potential benefits of projects, there can be issues with project-based learning: students may take on different tasks than their teammates, thus developing different skills and having different mastery experiences; and projects may impact students‘ self-confidence or self-efficacy differently, and may depend on the students‘ gender or class standing. This paper presents the results of a mixed-methods cross-sectional study focused on project experiences of students in the first, second, and final year of an undergraduate engineering curriculum: specifically, on the tasks that students take on and their changes in engineering confidence and self-efficacy. It was found that students generally experienced an increase in engineering confidence or self-efficacy over the course of the project semester, regardless of gender or class standing. There were differences in confidence between men and women observed at the beginning of first-year courses, but not in later years in the curriculum. However, while there was little evidence of stereotypically gendered divisions of tasks (women spending more of their time on managerial or communication work, men spending more of their time on technical or hands-on tasks) in first-year and sophomore classes, this division was found in senior-year projects. Our work highlights that project-based learning is beneficial for students in terms of increasing their engineering confidence and self-efficacy, but this increase may not persist, as seniors (fourth-year students) did not have higher self-efficacy than first-year students. © 2019, International Journal of Research in Education and Science.

The results show that the shift to grading technique use has resulted in improved student exam and future performance among weaker students, reduced drop-out rates, and lowered the student feedback score for the course. The added benefit according to textual feedback from students was that the new grading scheme teaches students the best practices of agile web development better than previously possible. © 2019 IEEE.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","Proc. - IEEE/ACM Int.

It remains a challenge to develop effective techniques for teaching parallel programing skills. Another challenge is finding time within already packed lectures to cover additional material. To that end, we investigate the effectiveness of using Project Based Learning (PBL) to teach parallel programming skills early in the curriculum by developing and incorporating a PBL module into CSc 3210 (Computer Organization and Programming). This is a core course taken by all computer science majors and is a prerequisite to many of our senior-level classes. In our case study, 124 students are organized into 26 diverse groups, with four or five students per group, and assigned five project assignments, each of two-weeks duration. Given a Raspberry PI, students will explore its multicore architecture and create programs for shared memory parallelism using OpenMP and C language. Our results show that incorporating this PBL module has a significant and direct effect on the student's growth in parallel programming skills. As a side benefit, we also show that there is a direct improvement on a student's personal growth in terms soft skills, which is essential in the professional development and success in the workplace. By having students experience PBL in an early class, close to the midpoint of the academic program, it can serve as a mini-capstone project. Furthermore, students can collaboratively learn by themselves (through teamwork) and apply the fundamentals of parallel programming skills without the need for separate lectures, labs, or workshops. © 2019 IEEE.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","Proc. - IEEE Int.

By the end of each of the three iterations, students get a grade that takes into account several aspects including peer assessment. In the past, students with low commitment used to get only a slightly lower grade because peer assessment's weight was very low. Last semester we added a new grading rule: if the peer assessment is lower than a threshold, then such a grade would be final for the affected student(s). In this work we aim to show the effectiveness of this rule for promoting teamwork quality by recording the progression of peer assessments along the semester. We found that peer assessment decreases and is more disperse in the second iteration, but significantly improves in the third iteration.

The Engineering School at the Universidad de Chile has put in practice a strong women recruitment program. This brought that, for the first time, women reached 20% of the students enrolled in the fifth year software engineering capstone course. Problem: More women are entering the work force but there is still certain prejudice about women performance in STEM in general, and in software development in particular, since it is perceived as a man's activity. Method: In the context of the fifth year capstone course at the CS Department of the Universidad de Chile we conducted a field study in order to analyze the progression of self and peer assessment of men and women students along one semester. Results: We found that, even though peer assessment is similar for women and men, self assessment tends to be lower for women. Also, peer assessment does not vary much along the semester, neither for men nor for women. Conclusions: Women performance in software development teams is highly regarded by teammates. However, women do not seem to be willing to acknowledge their own performance. More research is needed in order to understands the causes of this behavior. © 2019 IEEE.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","Proc. - IEEE/ACM Int. Workshop Gend. Equal. Softw.

Several previous studies have proposed genetic algorithm-based group formation scheme that considers multiple student characteristics to optimize collaborative learning groups. However, the fitness function used in the genetic algorithm (GA) for assessing the quality of group formation may determine collaborative learning groups with unbalanced learning characteristics. Additionally, few studies considered how learning roles and interactions among peers can be used to optimize collaborative learning groups and confirmed the effects of different group formation schemes on learning performance and peer interaction. Therefore, this work proposes a novel genetic algorithm-based group formation scheme with penalty function (GAGFS-PF) that considers the heterogeneous of students’ knowledge levels and learning roles, and the homogeneity of social interactions measured by social network analysis among the members in the learning group, to generate collaborative learning groups with balanced learning characteristics for improving students’ learning performance and facilitate students’ interactions in a collaborative problem-based learning (CPBL) environment. This work uses a quasi-experimental research method to collect quantitative data to assess the effects of three group formation schemes - the proposed GAGFS-PF, the random group formation scheme, and the self-selection group formation scheme - on the learning performance and effects of interaction in a CPBL environment and also adopts interview to enhance the results of qualitative data analysis. Namely, this study adopts a mixed study to examine the research findings. Eighty-three students from three Grade 6 classes at an elementary school in New Taipei City, Taiwan were invited to participate in the experiment. Three classes were randomly assigned to the three experimental groups that used different group formation schemes including the proposed GAGFS-PF, random group formation scheme, and self-selection group formation scheme for CPBL activities on the topic of “global warming.” The results reveal that the proposed GAGFS-PF is significantly superior to the random group formation scheme in the score of a completed report assessed by two teachers during the “action 2” learning stage, among the four CPBL stages. Analytical results also show that the proposed GAGFS-PF for group formation is significantly superior to the random and self-selection group formation schemes in the effects of peer interaction, as assessed using social network measures. The interview results also support that the proposed GAGFS-PF provides benefits in determining collaborative learning groups. This work contributes a novel and useful group formation scheme for enhancing collaborative learning performance and also helps in calling for future research in this field as well. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Elsevier Ltd","Comput Educ",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85060937492

Previous work also suggests that analytical and problem-solving, communication, initiative, planning and organizational, and teamwork competencies among construction professionals can help to resolve the most common BIM issues in construction projects. This indicates a new and complementary set of BIM skills that may need to be targeted by educators when preparing students for successful future careers. Previous literature from non-BIM domains suggests that problem-based learning can enhance these types of skills, but there is not an understanding of the extent to which this mode of education can benefit BIM-specific applications. This study aims to analyze the impact of implementing a single-session problem-based learning module that targets the previously identified skills in BIM-relevant contexts. It was found that problem-based learning enabled students to generate better outputs related to solving common issues in BIM-based construction projects. Furthermore, students perceived improvements in their analytical and problem-solving, teamwork, and communications skills after completing the activity. This study adds to the body of knowledge by providing educators with empirical evidence to illustrate how problem-based learning can support BIM education. The lessons from this study could help educators target these same learning benefits in future studies.

The dominant argument suggests that by engaging in real world projects and research, students can acquire valuable critical thinking, team work, problem-solving, and improved communication skills. The aim of this work-in-progress paper is to investigate the effects of PBL on student performance in a requirements engineering (RE) course. Students were divided into 5 project groups; each group carried out a RE project that addresses a real-world problem. The project deliverable for each group is a complete software requirements specification (SRS) document; a user interface design; and software development project management plan. Following the completion of the project, structured feedback was elicited from the students via questionnaires. The results were combined with the final student grades to evaluate the effect of PBL on their combined performance. Preliminary results show that PBL can benefit RE courses, especially by enhancing students performance. Yet, certain challenges, e.g., stakeholders engagement and team cohesion, must be addressed before these benefits can be fully realized. © 2018 IEEE.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","Proc.

While peer assessments are often used to encourage personal responsibility for group tasks (and discourage 'social loafing'), they may fail to account for the way students' attributes contribute to their perceptions of the behavior of peers. These perceptions may be inconsistently held from one person to the next and are driven by various factors (like gender), including the attributes of the judger, the individual being judged, the relationship between the two, and/or the group at large. This study seeks to answer: Does the perception of a peer's team behavior (in terms of frequency or severity) vary with the gender identity of the individuals involved? This study uses a newly-created survey called the Team Behaviors and Attitudes Survey to assess the subjective perceptions of each of eleven undesirable teammate behaviors. Data has been collected from 47 teams, involving 329 unique pairings of students. For each of these behaviors, proportion tests and chi-square hypothesis tests are used to assess whether gender identity affects how severely and frequently behaviors are perceived, respectively. Males were found to often rate others more severely than females, regardless of the gender of the target. Other results were mixed, emphasizing the particularities inherent in perception creation. © 2018 IEEE.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","Proc. Front. Educ. Conf.

Online tools, such as Slack.com, provide team engagement and project management. While metrics can be defined for team and individual performance, it is difficult to measure collaboration and its impacts. Specifically, the forms of collaboration that lead to a successful software product should have associated metrics that correlate with individual performance, peer assessments, and project outcomes. Given the difficulty of assembling teams that best exemplify collaborative personality traits, it may be more beneficial for team members to recognize these traits so that their positive aspects can be exploited toward a successful product outcome. We employ IBM WatsonTM Personality Insights service to analyze team Slack.com posts collected from forty students across ten teams and two semesters of the capstone class. We correlate thirteen traits recognized for influencing collaboration with team grades, Sprint meeting check-in quality, and peer evaluations. The correlations show that each trait is related to at least one performance metric during at least one of the Sprints. We discuss the potential meaning of different traits emerging at different times during the semester and how that can inform strategies for software developer collaboration awareness and reward. © 2018 IEEE.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","Proc.

An undergraduate capstone project typically involves a student development team as well as other stakeholders such as faculty advisors and industry mentors. Given that the agile development approach is adopted, a sprint review is conducted at the end of each sprint to demonstrate and critique the features that the development team have completed. Unlike the industrial settings, capstone design students can be challenged when conducting agile sprint reviews. On the one hand, the availability of industry mentors is unpredictable due to their own business commitments and schedules. On the other hand, it is extremely hard to bring all stakeholders together in one meeting. To overcome these difficulties, in our practice we have employed two strategies. First, we used a so-called agile buddy approach which allows each team to acquire an outsider student's opinion on their system. Second, we adopted a web-based collaboration platform such that students can collect critiques asynchronously from different stakeholders. © 2018 IEEE.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","Proc.

Students are often lacking these skills even though they are desired skills to have both for academic success and in the workplace. For our research, we are exploring using virtual reality to teach four professional development skills to students. These skills are leadership, teamwork, communication and ethics. We are using virtual reality as an innovative tool to teach students these skills in an interactive and fun environment. This work-in-progress paper will discuss the activities that are being developed to teach engineering students professional development skills at Iowa State University. In this paper, we will discuss three activities that are being developed to teach these four different professional development skills. Our framework for these activities is using Game Based Learning (GBL), which is based on Problem Based Learning (PBL). Each activity will be based on a problem that students must work together to solve. Through this interaction, students will learn one or more of the professional development skills outlined in this paper. The goals and learning outcomes of each activity will then be outlined and discussed in more detail. We will outline the execution of each activity and how the interaction between the students and the virtual reality system will be accomplished. In this paper, we will show our current work in progress of the development of the game environment used in these activities. This will include screen shots and other examples of the game environment for each activity. The development platform used for these activities is the Unity platform, a free game development software package that includes tools for working with virtual reality. The virtual reality headset that will be used with Unity will be the HTC Vive. This allows us to have an interactive environment where students can see and hear in the virtual space and use controllers to interact with objects in the virtual space. We are also adding physical props that can interact with the virtual space. The addition of these props is designed to allow multiple players to be involved while keeping costs low and increasing the portability of the system. © 2018 IEEE.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","Proc.

Design National cross-sectional study on data collected in 2016. Setting 95 Bachelor of Nursing Sciences programmes; 27 Italian Universities. Participants Students who (a) were attending or just completed their clinical rotations lasting at least 2 weeks in the same unit, and (b) willing to participate in the study. Primary and secondary outcomes First to measure the occurrence of IPE experiences in the most recent clinical rotation; the secondary outcome was to discover factors associated with IPE occurrence. Measures The primary outcome was measured using questions based on a 4-point Likert scale (from 0=never' to 3=always'). Explanatory variables were collected at both individual and regional levels with items included in the same questionnaire. Results 9607 out of 10 480 students took part in the study. Overall, 666 (6.9%) perceived not having had any IPE experience, while 3248 (33.8%), 3653 (38%) and 2040 (21.3%) reported having experienced IPE opportunities only a little', to some extent' or always', respectively. From the multilevel analysis performed using the generalised linear mixed model, factors promoting the occurrence of IPE experiences were mainly set at (a) the clinical learning environment level (high: learning environment quality, self-directed learning encouragement, learning opportunities, quality of safety and nursing care and quality of tutorial strategies); and (b) the regional level, where significant differences emerged across regions. In contrast, male gender was negatively associated with the perception of having had IPE experiences. Conclusions A large number of nursing students experienced either never' or only a little' IPE opportunities, thus suggesting that nursing education tends to remain within the nursing profession. Limiting students' interprofessional exposure during education can prevent future collaborative approaches that have been shown to be essential in providing best patient care. In order to increase IPE exposure, it is necessary to develop strategies designed both at the singular unit and regional levels. © 2019 Author(s) (or their employer(s)).

Most jobs require interacting and working with others and the outcome of a team project relies on the processes of the group members. Naturally, a positive team experience yields better results than a negative experience. The biggest indicators of a positive team experience are communication and collaboration, which are both soft skills associated with the social sensitivity of the group members. Previous research has found that social sensitivity influences the amount of communication and the ultimate performance of traditional face-to-face teams. However, virtual teamwork is becoming more common. Does social sensitivity have a similar influence in virtual teams? Virtual teams have different interactions than face-to-face teams because they use communication technologies, which can hinder certain human cognitive processes. Our current research focuses on the influence of social sensitivity on the amount of communication and the performance of students who work as a virtual team using text-based communication in Discord. We find that teams with higher average levels of social sensitivity communicate more and perform better, even if they work in a virtual environment using only text messaging. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.","Association for Computing Machinery, Inc","SIGCSE - Proc.

For example, a project team may be located in Australia while the team lead resides in the US. Senior design or capstone projects offer students real-world hands-on experience but rarely while working internationally. One reason is that most instructors do not have international business contacts that allow them to find project sponsors in other countries. Another reason is the fear of having to invest a huge amount of time managing an international project. This paper presents two resources to help universities expand international experiences for students. The first is a methodology for how to manage student teams while tracking individual contributions/performance and the second is a platform where a university can apply to be paired with a university in a different country for a project exchange. We start by introducing the general concepts related to ""International Capstone Project Exchanges"", the basic model behind the exchanges (student teams work from their home university while being mentored by an industry sponsor residing in a different country) and several alternate models that have been used in practice. We also describe templates/processes used in evaluations of individual team members. The paper concludes with a detailed description of an International Capstone Project Exchange (ICPE) platform that has been developed to aid any university in establishing their own international project exchange. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.","Association for Computing Machinery","ACM Int.

The results suggest that task value and task authenticity exerted significant effects on learner satisfaction. Problem-solving efficacy, teamwork competency, task authenticity, and satisfaction exerted significant effects on learning outcomes, but task value did not. The results imply that the effects of problem-solving efficacy on perceived achievement reveal the importance of motivational factors in capstone design courses.

PBL requires a good spread of students based on their individual skills, this pushes for a successful outcome. Traditionally, the students are assigned to the group randomly by facilitators. In group assignment problem (GAP) students need to be placed in the appropriate groups encapsulating on general and specific criterions where possible to provide diversity. However, the need for a system arises where the assignment of students to groups require not only students to be based on certain criteria but also takes into account specific constraints. Constraints allow taking parameter such as skill preference in an unevenly or limited distributed skill set. For successful completion of projects, there is a need for groups that share same strength. In this paper, a generic method is proposed that uses the genetic algorithm to generate evenly balanced groups. We have employed weightless penalty function to rank the preference of certain constraints based on skills and incur a penalty if they are not satisfied.

The success of PBL relies on team composition where all necessary skills to execute the project is needed.

Most computational tools solve the group assignment problem (GAP) by assigning students to relevant groups based on some general criterion. However, there is a need for a system which allows taking skill preference as a parameter in a limited or unevenly distributed skill set. The system needs to have more or less same strength with the presence of all the skills required to complete the project.

This decreases in higher education with 9% of females compared to 29% of males choosing a STEM subject in 2017 [1]. To address this issue there are many initiatives being set up to recruit females into STEM higher education courses. However there is a lack of research into the experiences of female students once they have started their degree programme in Computer Science. In this study we investigate the roles which undergraduate female students choose in a large software engineering team project to find out if there are barriers that prevent them from taking on technical or programming roles in these projects. We analysed assessment data to determine their previous programming experience and then performed a content analysis of team project deliverables and peer assessment scores. The results show that our female students, despite their strong academic background, tend to pick less technical roles in these projects than male students and are subsequently awarded lower peer review scores by their teammates for their contribution to the group work. These results indicate that teaching interventions may need to take place to make the role choice and peer review processes fairer in such projects. Further investigations are needed to see if there is some form of unconscious bias or imposter syndrome occurring in our software engineering team project module and if this is a common phenomenon in these projects in other HE institutions. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.","Association for Computing Machinery","ACM Int.

Early and sustained collaboration helps students to strive beyond introductory programming towards professional software development. However, during their first year of study, students can find teamwork challenging. To equip learners with the foundational knowledge, skills, and experience that they need to collaborate effectively so early in their studies, a 3-day Robot Olympics using Lego Mindstorms EV3 robots can be deployed. The exercise draws upon Salas’ big-five model of teamwork, making first-year students aware of coordinating mechanisms that aid in clarifying expectations and managing conflicts. These then act as lenses for reflection and feedback. Comparing a baseline cohort in 2015-16 to a cohort in 2016-17, after the introduction of the Robot Olympics, reveals a statistically significant reduction in team discord in an assessed collaborative programming project (d = 0.76). This suggests that the Robot Olympics made a positive contribution to the design of the first computing module.

Thus, the main difficulties in cooperative learning are promoting positive interdependence and individual accountability. This work aims to analyze whether monitoring questionnaires (MQs) allow rating each teammate's individual accountability in a chemical process design project. Students took MQs just after finishing each deliverable, in order to verify each one's knowledge of the essential aspects of the team project. We assume that, if all the teammates work responsibly and cooperatively, they will be able to answer the MQs easily and correctly. The MQs were designed to be: 1) generic; 2) succinct; and, 3) quickly answered in the classroom. In addition, different rating methods were analyzed to incorporate MQs scores into each individual's project grade. The best results were obtained when student's individual grade was computed as the product of the team assignment grade and the weighting factor WF3, calculated as the individual average MQs rating divided by the highest MQs rating in the team.

However, few high schools and faculties in their curricula provide students with knowledge on teamwork, and therefore, graduates do not have appropriate competences in this area. In the course of studies, students usually learn about advanced IT tools for specialized applications, but they are rarely taught how to use groupware. As a part of the course on Information Technology at the Faculty of Production and Power Engineering of the University of Agriculture in Krakow, classes on team work have been conducted for several years. The article presents an analysis of didactic classes using this type of software carried out in 2015-2018. Differences in the work performed in individual fields of study prove that graduates of technical schools (technicians) are better prepared for teamwork than people finishing general schools (high school). The tasks are carried out by first-year students (first semester), so team members primarily use their skills acquired in high school or outside the school. The introduction of groupware to the study curricula seems to be necessary in modern education. The introduction of the Polish qualification’s framework forces the graduates to obtain social competences covering cooperation in the group. Consequently, students carry out team projects, but such work cannot be effective without the use of modern information and communication technologies. © 2019, International Multidisciplinary Scientific Geoconference.

Project-based learning courses, however, often build upon other previously taught technical courses, where the technical content for the project to be developed is studied. That type of course design focuses on building the transversal capabilities of students, and the technical challenges of the project are the mean to acquire these non-technical skills. In this paper, we present and assess a project-based course on computer network applications of a computer science school, which has been designed to improve within the same course both the transversal and technical skills of the students. The proposition of interest is that the course not only aims to train the students’ transversal skills by a group work project, but also to practise new technical topics and technologies. We argue that the key element of the proposed course design is that each student project group defines with the instructor the project they would like to develop in the course. We present first the design of the course and then an assessment with questionnaires, which were conducted over two semesters with the students enrolled in the course. The obtained results indicate that the students achieved both technical and transversal skills, while the instructors need to be flexible to adapt to diverse technical topics of the proposed projects. © 2019 by SCITEPRESS – Science and Technology Publications, Lda.

Such projects help students to understand what they will face in the industry and experience real customer interaction and challenges in collaborative work. To provide this opportunity in an academic environment and enhance the learning and multicultural teamwork experience, the University of Oulu, Finland offers the software factory (SWF) project. This paper presents the design of the SWF course and the learning environment and assessment techniques, and it discusses the importance of reflective learning diaries and serious games. Additionally, this paper examines factors in the SWF learning environment that affect student learning in the SWF course. Survey data were collected from the last six years of SWF projects. The results show that students consider the SWF to be a good collaborative learning environment that helps them achieve academic triumphs and enhances various professional skills. The learning diaries are effective for increasing students' learning experiences as well as providing an opportunity for teaching staff to monitor students' progress and offer better facilitation.

On the other hand, they have also proven to be difficult to grade in a balanced way which would be perceived as fair by the students. Numerical ratings such as those delivered by the Fink method provide ways to determine the shares of contributions of each individual team member. But such bare numerical evaluation needs also some secondary justification that helps team members to understand why their rating is high or low. Methods to collect such additional feedback often rely on surveys; however, extensive surveys may be perceived as tedious by the students, especially as they need to be filled out for each other team member participating in the team. This may have negative effect on the quality of feedback collected in form of surveys. We present a novel approach to peer assessment of a team-based project exploiting badges that represent individual contributions to the task and teamwork related traits. We show that this approach has positive influence on engagement in peer assessment compared to free-text open questions. We also study if the feedback obtained in this way is informative and to which extent it can serve as replacement for open free-text questions. © J.UCS.","IICM","J. Univers. Comput.

Education literature databases were searched for peer-reviewed journal articles that discussed undergraduate science-based degree programs with project-based learning units involving students from multiple disciplines. Data were analysed for evidence of a skill gain in 6 areas (Discipline knowledge, Communication, Teamwork, Interdisciplinary effectiveness, Critical thinking and problem solving, and Self-management). Projects were assigned to categories based on interdisciplinary breadth and depth. Data was analysed by cross-tabulations, Fisher’s Exact test and by calculating odds ratios (OR), which indicate the effect size. Perception of a skill gain was significantly more likely to be reported than an objectively measured skill gain (p<0.001). Real discipline skill gains were 6.6 times more likely in projects narrow in discipline mix (OR 6.6), however perceived discipline skill gains were high irrespective of project type. Projects with wide interdisciplinarity were significantly associated with perceived gains in interdisciplinary effectiveness (OR 32, p<0.05) and more likely to have perceived gains in communication (OR 2.5) and teamwork (OR 3.4) skills. When projects have greater interdisciplinary breadth or depth, perceived student employability skill gains increase, perceived discipline skill gains are unaffected, however actual discipline skill gains are less reported.

Faculty accumulated nearly 12 years of experience running a graduate software engineering capstone course perceived the need to better assist students on the learning process. Course adaptations are required, particularly considering the heterogeneity of student's background and work experience, as well as the use of current technologies and tools. The paper outlines an evolved graduate software engineering capstone course for part-time graduate professional students. The capstone course is intended to create a meaningful student experience while providing a productive environment to apply knowledge learned from the program. Moreover, the new proposal emphasizes agile methodologies and code as the primary artifact. Our main contribution is to present the evolution of this capstone course, from inception to coding, testing and deployment. The course revision includes new artifacts, such as a work breakdown structure and burndown chart, as means to improve the course learning outcomes based on lessons learned and student experience. For evaluation purposes, we selected groups of most recent capstone course sections totaling 175 students. Two learning objectives of the program were evaluated: Teamwork and critical thinking. Critical thinking was assessed via the project plan artifact. Teamwork was assessed through discussion forums, team test plans and reports. The results were positive; however, they indicate that not all elements of project planning are present in the studio course. © 2019 TEMPUS Publications.","Tempus Publications","Int. J. Eng.

The encouragement of empathy skill in school was discussed in two situations: 1. Using design thinking approach for project-based learning and 2. Promoting as a classroom culture. Empathy is an act of understanding, being conscious and experiencing the feeling and thoughts of other people. It is the key to inspire social innovation and diminishing prejudice against others. Empathy skill has affected our feeling of wellbeing and human centeredness to provide an understanding of people's needs. By integrating design thinking process in school, students will equip themselves with empathy-related skills such as communication, observation, decision-making and positive relationship with others as part of their active learning process. Adapting design thinking in project-based learning requires students to be aware and concern in exploring human-driven design which leads to user satisfaction for any problem's solution. Empathy also has the advantage of forming a positive classroom culture and sustaining a good teacher-student relationship. This paper discussed how the design thinking process can promote empathy skill during project-based learning for humanizing decision-making and the opportunity for empathy integration in the classroom to engage in positive collaboration and teamwork. © UiTM Press.","UiTM Press","Asian J.

The rolling labs cover different levels of complexity and integration of the electronics and components used in modern applications and hence undergraduate students can start working with interesting and close to reality systems rather early. The rolling labs enable several different possibilities of teaching and learning, either for standard labs, for team works in terms of problem-based learning (PBL) or for individual works like bachelor or master thesis.

Following the principle of educational psychology, a collaborative learning approach incorporates online learning activities to encourage active interaction and to cultivate problem-solving abilities via students’ discussion. This study aims to identify the classification of students’ interaction in the online social collaborative problem-based learning environment and the strategies to enhance online interaction. Methodology: The literature search was performed using the following electronic databases: Elsevier (ScienceDirect), Springer, Google Scholar, IEEE Xplore, SAGE, Emerald Insight, Taylor and Francis, ERIC and Scopus and Wiley Online Library for all papers published between 1989 and 2019. The initial search yielded 129 published articles. After screening and eligibility assessment, 28 articles were included in the review. Main Findings: The types of interaction among students included learner-learner, learner-instructor, learner-content, learner-interface, and learner-self. Less common types of interaction included learner-instruction, learner-environment, and learner-tool. Most researchers focused only on student-student interaction, especially studies between 2017 to 2019. As for improvement strategies, some papers focused on specific learner’s interaction whereas others only outlined the general strategy without specifying the type of learner’s interaction. Applications: Interaction is an important element of online learning. Activities involved in the active interaction among students such as sharing of ideas, discussion, negotiation, and opinion exchanges can improve their knowledge and thinking skills. As the student-centred approach in improving learning experience is gaining popularity, findings from this study can be incorporated into today’s education system to enhance students’ interaction during online learning. Novelty/Originality: The results from this study will contribute to the existing literature on the types of interactions during online learning and strategies to improve students’ interaction. We hope that this study enhances the understanding of the various stakeholders on the importance of effective interaction among students in the online learning environment towards the development of the thinking skills of our students.

Groups learned the required programming skills as needed to implement their vision. Students completed a survey about their experience in the course. Students found the course exercised their creative skills, motivated them to learn more programming and provided them with experience in project management. © 2019 American Society for Engineering Education.

Creation of new interdisciplinary capstone courses may not be feasible for some departments or institutions, however, due to administrative or funding complexities. As an alternative, the inclusion of interdisciplinary projects engaging students enrolled in separate single-discipline capstone courses may offer the opportunity to undertake interesting projects, or engage with certain sponsors, that would not be possible without the contributions of students from diverse disciplines. Having such projects undertaken by interdisciplinary teams of students who remain in their single-discipline capstone courses does not reduce, and may amplify, the challenges found in fullfledged interdisciplinary capstone courses (e.g., misaligned schedules, differing requirements, and unfamiliar working cultures). This paper provides findings from the pilot year of a series of opportunistic interdisciplinary capstone projects associated with NASA's Psyche Asteroid Mission involving students from computer science, computer systems engineering, engineering management, industrial design, and graphic design. The findings highlight the importance of close communication and flexibility between faculty and identify a novel and potentially-replicable approach of including project management capstone students on interdisciplinary teams. The paper also describes changes that were implemented for the national expansion of the program with the 2018-2019 academic year and provides early lessons learned associated with those changes, outlining a plan for iterative improvement. © 2019 TEMPUS Publications.","Tempus Publications","Int.

A key challenge faced by education organizations is to find a balance between teaching and learning to ensure knowledge acquisition and transfer to students. This can be achieved by offering engaging learning experiences, and providing students with learning spaces and ICT (information and collaboration technologies) that foster participatory problem solving, creativity, collaboration, and socialization. This requires understanding the relation between and impacts of (1) learning spaces, (2) activity and content that is created and shared, and (3) behavioral, social, and cognitive aspects of learning and teamwork. The paper discusses key features of learning spaces that start to address the generation of students that is “born digital” and hyperconnected, that uses space and ICT as transformative elements. The paper presents enablers, hindrances, and requirements for physical, virtual, and social learning and teamwork environments. The brick & bits & interaction (BBI) methodology developed in the PBL Lab was used to analyze the relationship between space, ICT, and learning experience, respectively. The study identifies key learning and teamwork space factors that facilitate dynamic participation of all members, i.e., students, instructors, and mentors, in the knowledge transfer and learning activity. The paper uses concrete examples of learning spaces from the Y2E2 building, PBL Lab and iRoom (interactive room) in the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering to demonstrate some of these factors. © Nottingham University Press","Nottingham","EG-ICE - Int.

Most of the offered projects are sponsored by industrial partners and all are mentored by clients’ representatives and faculty members. The presented paper discusses the implementation of design-based learning approach to integrate the technical engineering design knowledge and the learning skills of interpersonal nature, such as communication skills, adaptability, teamwork, etc. In addition to the discussion of the design-based learning frame application, the paper deliberates over the importance of aligning the learning outcomes and the grading policy with the engineering design phases in engineering capstone design courses.

However, although students may work in teams, it is unknown how this interaction impacts on performance. The objective of this work was to understand how interaction impacts the performance of teams adopting BIM. A case study was carried out with 25 students in their final year of civil engineering and taking a Virtual Design and Constructioncourse.

We therefore undertook a large-scale, curriculum-wide study to investigate the effects of time spent on a variety of classroom activities on learning gains. We quantified classroom practices and related these to student learning, assessed using diagnostic tests written by over 3700 students, across 31 undergraduate biology classes at a research-intensive university in the Pacific Northwest. The most significant positive predictor of learning gains was the use of group work, supporting the findings of previous studies. Strikingly, we found that the addition of worksheets as an active learning tool for in-class group activities had the strongest impact on diagnostic test scores. This particular low-tech activity promotes student collaboration, develops problem solving skills, and can be used to inform the instructor about what students are struggling with, thus providing opportunities for valuable and timely feedback. Overall, our results indicate that group activities with low barriers to entry, such as worksheets, can result in significant learning gains in undergraduate science. © 2019 Weir et al.

The course learning objectives focused on students’ abilities in relationship to broader contextual issues (process), a bounded technical challenge and its social implications (project), and their role in the process (reflection). A key goal for the course was to help students recognize how their disciplinary identity shapes the way they approach problems and to recognize the value of perspectives from other disciplines. We present an analysis of both qualitative and quantitative data to explore whether the course met these objectives and to reflect on the opportunities and challenges such a class provided for our students.

CH requires a broad range of disciplinary expertise from across the spectrum to work in a cohesive and productive way. Building this interdisciplinary relationship at an earlier stage of career development may nurture and accelerate the CH developments and innovations required for future health care. Objective: This study aimed to explore the perceptions of interdisciplinary CH researchers regarding the design and delivery of an interdisciplinary education (IDE) module for disciplines currently engaged in CH research (engineers, computer scientists, health care practitioners, and policy makers). This study also investigated whether this module should be delivered as a taught component of an undergraduate, master’s, or doctoral program to facilitate the development of interdisciplinary learning. Methods: A qualitative, cross-institutional, multistage research approach was adopted, which involved a background study of fundamental concepts, individual interviews with CH researchers in Greece (n=9), and two structured group feedback sessions with CH researchers in Ireland (n=10/16). Thematic analysis was used to identify the themes emerging from the interviews and structured group feedback sessions. Results: A total of two sets of findings emerged from the data. In the first instance, challenges to interdisciplinary work were identified, including communication challenges, divergent awareness of state-of-the-art CH technologies across disciplines, and cultural resistance to interdisciplinarity. The second set of findings were related to the design for interdisciplinarity. In this regard, the need to link research and education with real-world practice emerged as a key design concern. Positioning within the program context was also considered to be important with a need to balance early intervention to embed integration with later repeat interventions that maximize opportunities to share skills and experiences. Conclusions: The authors raise and address challenges to interdisciplinary program design for CH based on an abductive approach combining interdisciplinary and interprofessional education literature and the collection of qualitative data. This recipe approach for interdisciplinary design offers guidelines for policy makers, educators, and innovators in the CH space. Gaining insight from CH researchers regarding the development of an IDE module has offered the designers a novel insight regarding the curriculum, timing, delivery, and potential challenges that may be encountered. © Ioanna Chouvarda, Nicola Mountford, Vladimir Trajkovik, Tatjana Loncar-Turukalo, Tara Cusack.","Journal of Medical Internet Research","J.

Thus, the paper aims to provide insights into the iterative learning processes of developing games in online game based learning. The empirical data is based on an explorative case study where master students from the international Nordic Visual Studies and Art Education (NoVA) design games as a part of an online game-based learning course. Throughout the course the students were situated at three different universities in Finland, Sweden and Denmark, collaborating cross-cultural across campuses. The purpose of the study was to explore how to establish an online space for joint design inquiry in the context of games for changes across cultural and professional barriers. The data used for analysis is teaching observations, videos of play sessions, students’ reflection papers, written and oral evaluation with participants after completion of the course. The analysis is based on different PBL activities; lectures, video tutorials, presentation-and feedback sessions, reflexive exercises and students’ self-directed design processes and learning in groups. Game theory and exercises were presented through videos and visuals to support the students’ iterative processes of developing games. Analysis of the PBL activities show how teachers’ video tutorials relating theoretical game concepts to the students’ group work supported their entrance in the game field as well as their design processes. How to balance feedback-related video tutorials and teachers’ time for preparation is identified as a relevant issue for further exploration in online game-based teaching. Findings show how the students’ visualisations and video productions exemplifying game situations, created a visible reference point for further discussions in the feedback sessions across campuses, which guided the game development. Thus, the combination of inquiry approaches, critical game theory and design processes combined with students’ visualisations and video productions indicates interesting connections for bridging gaps between professions, e.g. in art and games. © The Authors, 2019.

This paper describes the problem-based learning (PBL) model implemented. Two different types of problems were used: summative, marked for assessment purposes; and formative, in-class problems used to drive the learning on topics not directly covered on the summative problems, thus creating PBL environments for all the course. A questionnaire was used to assess the impact on the students of the PBL model implemented. The students' perceptions of the model are summarised. The advantages and disadvantages of implementing a PBL model, from the teachers' perspective, are described and some suggestions for teachers willing to use PBL models are included, to contribute to successful experiences for both students and teachers. Although using PBL will increase the workload of the teacher, if successfully implemented, the students' enthusiasm is quite rewarding. For a successful PBL course close to graduation, previous experiences of PBL or other inductive teaching models are ideal, for both students and teachers. One of the key messages to teachers is to start small and develop the PBL model gradually, making sure that students appreciate the teachers' effort and understand how the students will benefit from those models, both short-and long-term. © 2018 IEEE.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","Int.

The students' perceptions were collected using a questionnaire and the impact of those different tools on the students' perceptions are analysed. Some considerations for future implementations of similar approaches are put forward. The students' perceptions collected allowed concluding that using different and complementary teaching tools in project-based learning can be effective in promoting students' learning. The use of such tools may contribute to the development of both technical knowledge of students and of soft skills. For this case study, the results show that the students considered the computer tools useful in promoting and facilitating the construction of knowledge and in developing several competencies, i.e., in developing their learning processes. Nevertheless, a positive attitude and commitment by both the students and the instructors are essential to successful teaching and learning processes. Getting students on board, by discussing the aims of using specific strategies, is key to promote academic success.

This pedagogical practice emphasizes the impacts of BIM, as the digital collaboration platform, on the cross-disciplinary teamwork design through information sharing. This study also focuses on collecting students’ perceptions of building information modeling (BIM) effects in integrated project design. Challenges in BIM adoption from AEC students’ perspective were identified and discussed, and could spark further research needs. Design/methodology/approach: Based on a thorough review of previous pedagogical practices of applying BIM in multiple AEC disciplines, this study adopted a case study of the Solar Decathlon (SD) residential building design as the group project for AEC students to deliver the design work and construction planning. In total 13 different teams within the University of Nottingham Ningbo China, each group consisting of final year undergraduate students with backgrounds in architecture, civil engineering, and architectural environmental engineering, worked to deliver the detailed design of the solar-powered residential house meeting pre-specified project objectives in terms of architectural esthetics, structural integrity, energy efficiency, prefabrication construction techniques and other issues such as budget and scheduling. Each team presented the cross-disciplinary design plan with cost estimate and construction scheduling together within group reports. This pedagogical study collected students’ reflective thinking on how BIM affected their design work, and compared their feedback on BIM to that from AEC industry professionals in previous studies. Findings: The case study of the SD building project showed the capacity of BIM in enabling interdisciplinary collaboration through information exchange and in enhancing communication across different AEC fields. More sustainable design options were considered in the early architectural design stages through the cross-disciplinary cooperation between architecture and building services engineering. BIM motivated AEC student teams to have a more comprehensive design and construction plan by considering multiple criteria including energy efficiency, budget, and construction activities. Students’ reflections indicated both positive effects of BIM (e.g. facilitating information sharing) as well as challenges for further BIM implementation, for example, such as some architecture students’ resistance to BIM, and the lack of existing family types in the BIM library, etc. Research limitations/implications: Some limitations of the current BIM pedagogy were identified through the student group work. For example, students revealed the problem of interoperability between BIM (i.e. Autodesk Revit) and building energy simulation tools. To further integrate the university education and AEC industry practice, future BIM pedagogical work could recruit professionals and project stakeholders in the adopted case studies, for the purpose of providing professional advice on improving the constructability of the BIM-based design from student work. Practical implications: To further integrate the university education and AEC industry practice, future BIM pedagogical work could recruit professionals and project stakeholders in the adopted case study, for the purpose of providing professional advice in improving the constructability of the BIM-based design from student work. Originality/value: This work provides insights into the information technology applied in the AEC interdisciplinary pedagogy. Students gained the experience of a project-based collaboration and were equipped with BIM capabilities for future employment within the AEC job market. The integrated design approach was embedded throughout the team project process. Overall, this BIM pedagogical practice emphasized the link between academic activities and real-world industrial practice. The pedagogical experience gained in this BIM course could be expanded to future BIM education and research in other themes such as interoperability of building information exchange among different digital tools. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Emerald Group Publishing Ltd.","Eng.

Findings from this paper suggest that it is not enough to consider student-reported data in assessing team dynamics; hidden gendered behavior may be impacting students in ways that students do not realize or report. Background: Although the number of women in engineering is rising, difficulties still exist for female students in electrical engineering and computer science, particularly in team projects. Male and female students may have very different project experiences, due to differing levels of confidence/self-efficacy, difficult team dynamics, or inequitable task division. Research Questions: This paper aimed to elucidate what differences exist in the project experience between male and female students, considering self-reported measures (engineering confidence/self-efficacy, time spent on task, and team satisfaction) and observational study. Methodology: Students completed pre/post-project surveys, weekly logs, and post-project interviews to report and discuss their engineering confidence/self-efficacy, project task selection, and team satisfaction. This paper reports a case study of one student team, observed by a researcher throughout the project course. Findings: While student-reported data implied a lack of gender division (male and female students had the same levels of confidence, completed the same project tasks, and were similarly satisfied with their teams), the observational study implied that the student-reported data may not be telling the whole story. Given the difficult team dynamics observed in the student team (but not reported by students), findings suggest that difficult gender dynamics may go unrecognized by students. © 2018 IEEE.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","IEEE Trans Educ",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85048337205

Background: Studies find that men and women report taking on different roles in PBL projects, and that there is a relationship between team gender breakdown and students' satisfaction with PBL teams, with teams less happy with the inclusion of more women. Both male and female students on teams with two or more women report lower team satisfaction than men on teams of just men, or men and women on teams with a single woman Research Questions: How do students self-select, negotiate, and allocate tasks on PBL teams? How does past PBL experience influence task allocation? How does gender affect task allocation? Methodology: First-year students (N = 60) completed reflections about task assignment during a semester-long PBL experience. Findings: Individual student characteristics that are related to gender-including interests, skills, experiences, and self-efficacy-interact with students' goal orientations to lead to individual preferences regarding tasks.

These mediate the interactions among participants and of these with resources like documents and tools. These tools constitute a valuable source of information about the actual learning processes. However, this use faces multiple problems. Lecturers need to gain expertise on the data each tool provides and how to analyse them, each tool only offers a partial view of the process, students have different profiles and use different tools, and time to make analyses is limited. To address this situation, this work proposes the use of Assistants for Learning Activities (ALAs), i.e. semi-automated tools that use social knowledge to integrate different sources of information and interpret their data. This knowledge is extracted from literature on learning, and specified as social properties. These properties describe patterns that appear in information and their interpretation in terms of the learning-related activities. Their specification relies on a specific modelling language oriented to social activities and their context. It is designed to facilitate communication with the target learning communities. Wrappers for software tools get the raw data, transform them into facts for this language, and assert them in an information base. Then, a pattern matching algorithm finds instances of the social properties among these facts, giving an interpretation of the original data. A case study on teamwork in a project-based learning context of a university using several software tools illustrates the approach. It shows the feasibility of adapting the analysis through the modification of the considered properties, and how these can explain the observed data. © 2018 Association for Computing Machinery.","Association for Computing Machinery","ACM Int.

This paper presents an approach for introducing undergraduate research to engineering students in a Numerical Analysis of Engineering Systems course, which is typically a junior-level undergraduate course in most engineering departments. A course project was designed to allow the participating students to work in teams, read an assigned research paper that presents an exact solution of a problem related to smart materials and structures, locate the main equations, and write a computer code that uses these equations to regenerate the published results. Each team of students gave a presentation on the assigned paper, the main equations, the code developed to regenerate the results and graphs, with interpretations and conclusions. The project is contributing to the course outcomes and learning objectives as well as multiple ABET student outcomes. Final survey showed the effectiveness of the proposed project in introducing students to undergraduate research, and giving them the chance to understand the technical and mathematical language used in research papers, and experience working on new challenging problems.

As an alternative to the traditional type of assignment that consisted of several textbook problems, a project-based assignment was introduced in 2015 so that students could work on real-world geotechnical problems throughout the whole semester. Students were permitted to choose whether they would undertake the project-based assignment or the traditional one, thus forming the ‘project’ and ‘non-project’ groups, respectively. The academic performance of these two groups was compared on the basis of student marks while the student experience was evaluated through a series of interviews. The data collected over 3 years indicated that students from both groups had very similar academic performances; however, the students who completed the project-based assignment reported better engagement in the learning process as they enjoyed the opportunity to experience the practical aspects of soil mechanics.

In traditional teaching settings, there is an abundance of tools that can assist instructors in delivering their courses, as is evident from the number of available learning management systems (LMS) and other tools. However, LMS platforms are not as well developed for non-traditional teaching techniques in which the students play a bigger role in the learning process. An example of such techniques is the project-based learning (PBL) model where autonomous group work is at the heart of the course delivery and non-conventional assessments are utilized. In this study, we explore the potential and highlight some limitations of adapting Moodle (a popular, open source LMS system) to a PBL environment. We show that Moodle has a potential to leverage the learning process when it is utilized as the main communication platform (student-student and student-instructor) due to the abundance of accessibility and versatility such a tool provides to the instructor and the students. The use of LMS allowed us to better evaluate the course design, monitor student's performance, and communicate expectations with students.

However, the scarcity of collaborative devices combined with task-specific groupware tools may limit its full potential. In addition, there is a deficiency of investigations in the form of integrated settings between social media and mobile groupware. Therefore, this paper proposes the approach of mobile groupware (MobileMeeting) that can be integrated (i.e., embedded) into the popular social media posts that students currently use as a supplementary tool for collaborative learning. An investigation was conducted in real project-based scenarios with students, followed by post-session questionnaires including a log-report analysis from Google Analytics as supporting evidence. This study confirms that the proposed approach using MobileMeeting is capable of improving collective learning productivity and activities, including their satisfaction with the required groupware tools. The log-report analysis of students' case projects (social media marketing campaigns) also displays an increment in user engagement and retention by bringing the new user and a large number of returning user. In conclusion, these results have several practical implications: as collaborative learning activities become more complex, the setup of integrated social media and mobile groupware (MobileMeeting) can support a range of collective actions. © 2018 Chinese Automation and Computing Society in the UK - CACSUK.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","ICAC - IEEE Int.

SNA can enhance our understanding of the collaborative process, predict the under-achievers by means of learning analytics, and uncover the role dynamics of learners and teachers alike. As such, it constitutes an obvious opportunity to improve learning, inform teachers and stakeholders. Besides, it can facilitate data-driven support services for students. This study included four courses at Qassim University. Online interaction data were collected and processed following a standard data mining technique. The SNA parameters relevant to knowledge sharing and construction were calculated on the individual and the group level. The analysis included quantitative network analysis and visualization, correlation tests as well as predictive and explanatory regression models. Our results showed a consistent moderate to strong positive correlation between performance, interaction parameters and students’ centrality measures across all the studied courses, regardless of the subject matter. In each of the studied courses, students with stronger ties to prominent peers (better social capital) in small interactive and cohesive groups tended to do better. The results of correlation tests were confirmed using regression tests, which were validated using a next year dataset. Using SNA indicators, we were able to classify students according to achievement with high accuracy (93.3%). This demonstrates the possibility of using interaction data to predict underachievers with reasonable reliability, which is an obvious opportunity for intervention and support. © 2018 Saqr et al.

The program implemented a project-based learning, constructivist approach with three teachers co-teaching each lesson to maximize development of high-order thinking skills. Students learned the required ministry of education material for all subjects through projects based on group work and peer learning.

Most scholars recommend addressing these problems by awarding individual grades, computing some kind of individual weighting factor (IWF) from peer and (sometimes) self-assessments, which is then multiplied by the group grade to generate an individual grade. Several variants of the IWF method have been proposed, sometimes with complex algorithms. However, theory suggests they are inaccurate and their accuracy has not been evaluated. This article uses Monte Carlo experiments to assess the accuracy of the original IWF method and variants proposed in the past decade.

This paper investigates the use of diverse sensors, including computer vision, user-generated content, and data from the learning objects (physical computing components), to record high-fidelity synchronised multimodal recordings of small groups of learners interacting. We processed and extracted different aspects of the students' interactions to answer the following question: Which features of student group work are good predictors of team success in open-ended tasks with physical computing? To answer this question, we have explored different supervised machine learning approaches (traditional and deep learning techniques) to analyse the data coming from multiple sources. The results illustrate that state-of-the-art computational techniques can be used to generate insights into the ""black box"" of learning in students' project-based activities. The features identified from the analysis show that distance between learners' hands and faces is a strong predictor of students' artefact quality, which can indicate the value of student collaboration. Our research shows that new and promising approaches such as neural networks, and more traditional regression approaches can both be used to classify multimodal learning analytics data, and both have advantages and disadvantages depending on the research questions and contexts being investigated.

In this paper, we establish the importance of measuring processes in project-based software engineering courses and present metrics mined from software development tools for monitoring and observing processes to facilitate teaching. A case study at a US university confirms that 1) teams with better conformance to software development processes achieve better outcomes, and 2) our approach can be used to design metrics that serve as early detectors of violations to software development processes. Our results suggest that instructors for software engineering courses can use our approach to design process metrics for systematic, targeted, and automatic evaluation of team projects.

PBL allows abstract software engineering principles and practices to be learnt experientially making the course more appealing to diverse student cohorts. Employers favor PBL as students get exposed to current industry practices, processes and tools, thus narrowing the industry-academia gap. PBL however, poses a number of challenges. Academic staff need to find efficient ways of managing many additional tasks related to PBL such as getting licenses, developing technical materials, managing projects and handling team issues. Students involved in PBL need to be exposed to teamwork and project management skills concurrently. In this paper we present our experience evolving a hybrid-teaching model by using the action research cycle plan-act-observe-reflect over 3 semesters. The main novelty of our approach is the use of projects with varying levels of scaffolding, which made it possible for students with limited programming background to have an enjoyable and beneficial project experience. To ensure fairness, projects with high levels of scaffolding required implementation of more complex use cases to get higher grades. Student surveys reveal such an approach is effective for diverse undergraduate students. © 2018 Copyright is held by the owner/author(s).","Association for Computing Machinery","ACM Int. Conf. Proc.

We conducted a design-based research study to investigate how an asset-mapping activity could help team members to value each other's contributions in chemical engineering design projects. As part of our ongoing effort to redesign the curriculum to better support diverse students to persist in chemical engineering, we have been guided by the notion of building on students' assets and seeing their potential, rather than focusing on their deficits [2], [3]. We extended this notion by investigating how to help students see the assets they and their teammates bring. We report on student progress in a sophomore-level material and energy balance course (n= 63 in 10 teams) and a capstone chemical engineering design course (n= 53 in 12 teams) at a large, Hispanic-serving research university in the Southwest. The sophomores had prior design experience, as they were in a cohort that began after the curriculum had been redesigned to incorporate design challenges throughout the core chemical engineering coursework. The seniors did not have prior design experience within the curriculum. Both courses stressed the importance of teamwork and engaged students in working on design challenges. Students completed a two-part activity: They first identified their own assets and the assets of their teammates. They were then guided to map the assets across their team members and critically evaluate areas of strength and weakness. To aid them on the second portion, we provided a list of specific skills valued in professional engineering practice. In this paper, we focus on professional communication, project management, and interpersonal / teamwork skills. We collected all student work related to the activity. We developed a coding scheme to analyze the qualitative data and conducted basic statistics (correlations and t-tests) to analyze quantitative data. The two areas that fewer students reported having skills were in project management and communication, particularly communicating outside of engineering. Overall, the sophomores tended to report similar numbers of team members with each professional skill as the seniors. Whereas the seniors could clearly distinguish between the professional skill areas, the sophomores were not adept at this. To understand the impact of the team asset-mapping activity, we compared the sophomores' scores on items from a peer evaluation conducted twice during the semester. Early in the semester, students tended to report some difficulty managing conflicts related to team tasks, but by the end of the semester, significantly fewer teams did so. We also describe an asset-based modification we made to the teams in the senior capstone class. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2018.","American Society for Engineering Education","ASEE Annu.

The goal of this project is to increase student interest in and knowledge of STEM topics, and to help students recognize STEM as relevant to their daily lives and broader societal issues. The human-centered focus of the curriculum encouraged thinking from multiple perspectives (e.g. design, social science, programming) and allowed for diverse STEM exploration.

As such a method for computer science education, that supports project-based learning agile projects are being discussed more recently. In the context of a design-based research work, experienced teachers have adapted and applied a theory-derived agile model in a wide range of contexts. In this qualitative case-study, we analyze 11 interviews with 6 teachers on their observations from 20 agile projects with over 400 students. The aim is to gain insight into how agile practices assist individual learning processes and how they help teachers to design and organize projects in order to support students individually. A structured content analysis shows that agile teams face similar obstacles as teams in plandriven projects, but that they can overcome them better in agile projects. Additionally, the analysis indicates that in agile projects the quantity and quality of interactions increases, which has positive effects on the construction of sustainable skills and that students furthermore are frequently involved in feedback processes and reflections, which makes their learning more goal-oriented. Moreover, the data shows that teachers can identify their students' strengths and weaknesses better and also observe their individual learning processes better throughout agile project. Based on that knowledge they can design their agile project in a way that each student is challenged systematically and purposefully. © 2018 IEEE.","IEEE Computer Society","IEEE Global Eng. Edu.

TEASE proposes possible assignments and enables the instructor to manually adapt them based on their experience. The system also visualizes the effects of these changes on the previously defined objectives and constraints. Our evaluation in a multi-project capstone course shows that TEASE helps instructors create teams with better mean project priority while enabling them to satisfy constraints that were broken during manual assignment.

However, literature suggests that a common shortcoming of engineering graduates pertains to so-called 'softer' skills such as leadership, team work, time management and communication. Although not core to engineering activity, these competencies are important in the workplace and included in the exit level outcomes of accredited degrees. Development of these competencies can occur by giving engineering students the opportunity of involvement in extra-curricular projects that develop such complementary competencies. This paper discusses the Jozi Digital Ambassadors Project as one such opportunity. The project was launched by the City of Johannesburg, and aimed to roll-out free Wi-Fi to 700 000 Johannesburg residents who previously had no access to free public internet. A further aim was to provide training to these residents regarding how to access the free Wi-Fi and the online services offered by the City. 'Digital Ambassadors', unemployed young people who reside in the areas concerned, were appointed to undertake this training on behalf of the City. The University of Johannesburg, tasked with providing mentorship to these ambassadors, identified engineering students who were appointed as mentors. Structured interviews with the mentors were conducted at different stages of the project. The focus of the interviews was on the students' motivation to participate in the project and their skills development. The development of complementary competencies was one of the factors that motivated the students to join the project and their involvement in the Digital Ambassadors project gave them opportunities to develop leadership and communication skills in a way that the formal university curriculum did not. © 2018 IEEE.","IEEE Computer Society","IEEE Global Eng.

Meanwhile, several studies also proposed methods in online collaboration to enhance individual self-regulated learning (SRL). Notably, most existing studies focused on proposing methods and tools either for enhancing SSRL level within a team or for enhancing individual SRL. A computer-supported collaborative learning (CSCL) environment with proper supports is promising for simultaneously enhancing the SSRL level within a team and individual SRL because SSRL and SRL have an inseparable relation and mutually influence during collaborative process. Based on the existing principles and theories, this work adopts the supports of group awareness and peer evaluation in CSCL with project-based learning. Group awareness (GA) can reveal collaborative behaviour of group members and regulate their participation while peer assessment (PE), which can appraise member’s contribution, can encourage individual responsibility and refine regulatory strategies. This study finds that the proposed group awareness and peer assessment (GAPE) (i.e. the experimental class) moderately reduces the free-rider effect and enhanced SSRL level and individual SRL, compared with NO-GAPE (i.e. the control group). Furthermore, this study also confirms that the perceived SSRL level can effectively predict individual SRL. © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Taylor and Francis Ltd.","Behav Inf Technol",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85044211027

A game and recreational activity (GaRA) is a problem-based learning (PBL) method that engages students in a learning process through games and activity. The effectiveness of GaRA can be determined from an application of fuzzy conjoint analysis (FCA) to diminish fuzziness in determining individual perceptions. This study involves a survey collected from 68 students participating in a Mathematics Discovery Camp organized by a UKM research group, named PRISMatik, from two different schools. The aim of this research was to determine the effectiveness of modules delivered to motivate students towards mathematics subject in the form of GaRA through different factors. There were six games conducted for the participants and their perceptions based on the evaluation of six criterias were measured. A seven-point Likert scale, which indicates seven linguistic terms, was used to collect students' preferences and perceptions on each module of GaRAs. Scores of perceptions were transformed into degrees of similarity using fuzzy set conjoint analysis. Results found that interest, effort and team work was the strongest values obtained from GaRA modules in this camp as participants indicated their strong agreement that these criteria fulfilled their preferences in most module. Participants also stated that almost all attributes fulfilled their preference in each module regardless their individual academic achievement. Thus the method demonstrated that modules delivered through PBL approach has effectively motivated students through six attributes introduced. The evaluation using FCA implicated the successfulness of a fuzzy approach to evaluate fuzziness obtained in the Likert-scale and has shown its ability in ranking the attributes from most preferred to least preferred. © 2018 Author(s).","American Institute of Physics Inc.","AIP Conf.

The complex nature of programming and individual differences, including study approaches, thinking styles, and the focus of supervision, all have an effect on students’ achievement in programming. How students learn programming and the relationships between their study approaches and their achievement in programming have not yet been adequately illuminated. In this regard, the present study aims to investigate the effect of the study approach used on students’ attitudes toward programming and on their academic achievement within an online problem-based learning environment. In this study, a single-factor, pretest posttest single group and semiempirical method was utilized. The study was conducted on 41 students from a public university in Turkey. To implement problem-based learning activities, a teaching environment was created with the Moodle platform, allowing for group work and discussions. Seven status of the problems were prepared exclusively for the 12-week application period so that students could make suggestions about how to solve them. In the data collection phase, the Study Approach Scale, the Attitude Towards Programming Scale, and the Academic Achievement Test were employed. T-test and covariance analyses were carried out in the statistical analysis phase. According to the findings of the present study, students adopting the “deep” study approach were more successful than the students adopting a “superficial” approach. Moreover, it was determined that the problem-based learning application had a positive effect on students’ attitudes toward programming and that the study approach did not significantly affect the students’ attitude toward programming. © 2017, © The Author(s) 2017.","SAGE Publications Inc.","J.

Central to this challenge is the required shift in responsibility for who leads and owns the learning–from teacher to student. Such a shift requires a pragmatic pedagogical model to facilitate the transfer of control and ownership of learning. Vygotsky’s ‘more able other’ identified the peer as a key figure in learning. Teamwork facilitates project-based learning and, when mediated with technology, proves an effective partner in creating an engaging and autonomous learning experience. This paper describes the rationale for the design of a team-based model of twenty-first-century learning, particularly drawing upon the team-based learning model of the World Scout Movement. Results from a year-long study of the implementation of the model in an out-of-school context with 288 second-level students are presented.

The effects of uncertainty on ISD projects have been studied in the past in real organizational contexts, but the effects of uncertainty on students in Agile systems development have received less attention from scholars. In this study, we measured the effects of experienced uncertainty on students' performance in an Agile systems development course and how uncertainty affected the quality of the system developed by the students using Scrum. We implemented the course using a problem based learning (PBL) approach and simulated uncertainty through various work environment reflecting concepts. Our study reveals that the effects of uncertainty are fairly similar among students and software professionals, and we identified three different coping strategies that students used with varying degrees of success. We present that learning approaches such as PBL enable a befitting environment for students to acquire hands-on experience in coping with uncertain environments, thus mitigating the problems students are likely to face in their work environments. © 2018 by the Information Systems & Computing Academic Professionals, Inc.

The same methods combined with pedagogies of engagement can potentially be used in the setting of higher education to promote effective group learning in software development classrooms. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to integrate both Scrum and cooperative learning guidelines into a systems analysis and design classroom to promote the skills of teamwork, communication, and problem-solving while learning systems analysis and design methods. This integration was implemented in a sophomore, semi-capstone design course where students were engaged in collaborative classroom activities. Two different approaches - overlapped approach and delayed approach - were used in two different semesters for this implementation. Based on the analysis of student performance in the course, student reflections on their team performance, and student overall perceptions of the teaching approach, this study suggests that the integration of cooperative learning and Scrum serves as guidance for students to effectively analyze and design software solutions, as well as to reflect on their team performance and learning process. In addition, a delayed approach for Scrum implementation appears to effectively support student learning by providing better and earlier feedback. © 2018 by the Information Systems & Computing Academic Professionals, Inc.

Capstone projects provided by external clients facilitate authentic experiential learning, but sourcing external projects can be difficult, and there can be issues managing industry clients within an academic setting. Capstone projects also provide an opportunity for professional skill development to increase student employability, though to fully assess generic learning outcomes requires evaluating more than the final product created for the client. Teamwork can have a positive impact on student learning, however it is challenging to determine a process of assessment that enables formative and summative assessment that does not require an academic to immerse themselves within a team to evaluate an individual's contribution. Team members are often the best source of meaningful information, and self and peer assessment is commonly used as part of an assessment scheme, but to ensure the objectivity and integrity of the final grade it is necessary to correlate data from a variety of sources.

Most of the instructional strategies used to help students take advantage of these activities focus on supporting agile programming, which is appropriate for capstone courses. This is not always recommended in initial software engineering project courses, however, where novice developers run projects in teams while simultaneously taking other courses. To enhance the learning and teamwork experience in this latter instructional scenario, this paper proposes a formative monitoring method, reflexive weekly monitoring (RWM), for use in project courses that involve disciplined software processes and loosely coupled work. RWM uses self-reflection and collaborative learning practices to help students be aware of their individual and team performance. RWM was applied in a case study over nine consecutive semesters. The results obtained indicate that RWM was effective in enhancing the learning experience in the instructional scenario studied. While students in the monitored teams were more effective and coordinated, and experienced a higher sense of team belonging and satisfaction, little evidence was found of them being more productive than students working in non-monitored teams. © 1963-2012 IEEE.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","IEEE Trans Educ",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85029176385

Four different methodologies, ranging from a traditional “just assign some intermediate milestones” to other more Agile methodologies, were first compared via a controlled experiment. The results of this initial experiment showed that the project methodology used made a significant difference in student outcomes. Surprisingly, the Agile Kanban approach was found to be much more effective than the Agile Scrum methodology. Based on these initial results, in the second semester, we focused on use of the Kanban methodology. The findings in the second, more qualitative phase, confirmed the methodology’s usefulness and scalability. A key issue when using the scrum methodology was that the students had a very difficult time estimating what could be completed in each of their two-week sprints. The Kanban board, which visually shows and limits work-in-progress, was found to be an effective way for students to communicate with each other as well as with their instructor. In addition, Agile Kanban also streamlined the work required for instructors to efficiently provide guidance to student teams and to understand each team’s status. In summary, a scalable Kanban methodology, which can be applied to a wide variety of student computing projects, was found to an effective methodology to guide and manage student projects, improving student outcomes and minimizing instructor workload. © 2018 ACM.","Association for Computing Machinery","ACM J.

This paper aims to analyse the implementation of scrum approach in a project based learning context in higher education. The scrum approach was applied in the fourth year of the Industrial Engineering and Management (IEM) degree program, where teams of students developed a PBL project in an industrial context during the first semester. The research methodology focused on a qualitative approach. Semi-structured interviews were carried out to the Scrum Team (scrum master, product owner and the student team). Scrum Events were analysed through direct observation and Scrum Artefacts (Product Backlog, Sprint Backlog and Increment) were analysed based on a document analysis. The results of this study contribute to understand the effectiveness of the application of Scrum to complex PBL learning environments.

Combined FC-PBL makes use of learning technologies and supports authentic learning in terms of authentic context, multiple perspectives through team work and collaboration. FC involves watching educational videos prior to class session, and using the class session for practical tasks, thus supporting programming skills development. PBL enables authentic learning activities through group work and helps students to develop 21st century skills such as self-direction, collaboration, creativity and innovation. A research case study was conducted that considered a three-stage based delivery of the module that involved traditional, only FC, and combined FC-PBL teaching approaches applied on a number of programming topics. Both the educational and edutainment benefits were analyzed. The results show that combined FC-PBL approach is effective and the knowledge acquired by students improves, in particular, for the weaker students. Only 1.9% of students have scored an assessment mark lower than 40% compared to 28.3% and 24.5% when the traditional teaching and FC-only approaches respectively were used. Overall, a 26.56% increase in the assessment results was noticed when combined FC-PBL was used. The edutainment element was investigated through a questionnaire that assessed learning environment, engagement, learner satisfaction and whether the students have enjoyed learning sessions. The survey analysis shows that the combined FC-PBL approach does aid in the edutainment of mature students and provides an enjoyable learning experience. © 2018 International Forum of Educational Technology & Society (IFETS).","National Taiwan Normal University","Educational Technology and Society",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85055929243

The IEM program is currently attracting students from different programs, using transfer mechanisms, who normally already have passed some of the courses on their original program. Additionally, this program also attracts a number of students already working in some companies. These students are a bit older and their profile is also distinct from that of their fellow colleagues, which enter the university using a regular national ingress process. Thus, distinct situations are identified that demand a different learning approach. The teachers have come-up with one such distinct approach and called it ""non-PBL"", since the PBL model is structured in a way that students must have a specific profile, namely, to be first-year IEM student and enrolled a similar set of curricular units. With this in mind, this paper presents these situations, and describes the solution found to address this diversity. The solution must promote similar competences on both PBL and ""non-PBL"" students. A heavier workload is imposed on the teachers, given that the number of ""non-PBL"" teams formed can be as much as the number of PBL teams.

Problem-Based Learning (PBL) supports this by focusing on small group learning centered around authentic problems. PBL, however, usually relies heavily on face-to-face team collaboration and tutor guidance. Yet, when applied in online/blended environments, such elements may not be feasible or even desirable. This study explores how virtual teams collaborate in online learning tasks in the context of a nine-week Massive Open Online Course (MOOC) where international, virtual teams worked on PBL-like tasks. Twenty-one self-formed teams were observed. An inductive thematic analysis resulted in five themes: 1) team formation and team composition, 2) team process (organization and leadership), 3) approach to task work (task division and interaction), 4) use of tools, and 5) external factors (MOOC design and interaction with others). Overall findings revealed that online, virtual teams can collaborate on learning tasks without extensive guidance, but this requires additional communication and technological skills and support. Explicit discussion about group organization and task work, a positive atmosphere, and acceptance of unequal contributions seem to be positive factors. Additional support is required to prepare participants for virtual team work, develop digital literacy, and stimulate more elaborate brainstorming and discussion. © 2018, Athabasca University.","Athabasca University","Int.

We conducted an effectiveness study to explore whether the course design and targeted outcomes of one RBIS - an intrinsic motivation course conversion - were maintained after control of a converted course was turned over from the designing research team to a new set of instructors. The study was conducted as an amplified secondary analysis, combining data collected from multiple offerings of the converted course. The study triangulates data from course artifacts such as course syllabi and assignments, motivation surveys from 352 students, and post-course interviews with 27 students. Analysis of course artifacts revealed a high fidelity of implementation. Analysis of surveys and interviews revealed that small changes in the team formation process (a shift of project selection from before teams are formed to after teams are formed) for students' projects significantly undermined students' intrinsic motivation to learn - a core targeted outcome of this RBIS. We found that small changes in implementation can undermine the targeted outcomes for the intrinsic motivation course conversion. The documentation and promotion of RBIS must carefully consider how to support faculty through what may be the inevitable shortcomings in achieving the targeted outcomes of RBIS as the result of small changes in implementation. © 2018 TEMPUS Publications.","Tempus Publications","Int.

Every change in the project is immediately tested and reported to the entire team. Combining continuous integration and project based learning strategies allows a large group of students to plan their project together, and keep team members aware of project progress at any time, enabling them to test hypothesis and discuss with colleagues and also receive constant and immediate feedback from an automatic test procedure, as well from other team members. Agile development strategies, were used for general project development. In a planning meeting students discuss, during class time, strategies for developing the project requirements, and just after this meeting they start implementing the project. Then every week, students have a sprint assignment, which a cloud computing continuous integration infrastructure is available for implementing planned tasks. Unit tests and system tests are supplied at the sprint beginning by the instructor, supporting students to know their progress correctness instantaneously. Review and retrospective meetings are conducted by students at the end of sprint. This approach leads to teamwork cognitive and non-cognitive skills development, since students have to interact with their colleagues constantly in order to understand and develop in an ongoing project. An online Kanban board is shared by students, supporting them to organize their sprint. A computer engineering course about building and entire computer from basic hardware to sophisticated software was used as study case for this proposal. In a first moment, the pedagogical strategy developed limits the project autonomy, since the automatic integration and test procedures demand some prior project organization, but as the project evolve and students get more comfortable with the infrastructure, they start to develop their own tests and they shape the projects the way they decide. © 2018, University of Minho.

The criteria for the software are based on the findings of the doctoral thesis of the lead author. The teams are built on the basis of the results of criteria-centric self-evaluation questionnaire built into the software, which each student will have to answer so as to be considered a candidate for a team. Two hundred students had participated in this research; out of these 200, 100 students had used Psychographd for forming teams and the other 100 students had formed teams through random assignments.

The course aims at addressing the ability to effectively collaborate using virtual methods by gaining knowledge and skills on collaborative technology, managing information exchange, effective and efficient storage of information, handling CAD co-development, managing and documenting different versions and variants and documenting design rationale. Additional learning goals focus on the development of project problem solving skills in an intercultural and multi-domain engineering team and furthermore the development of trust and conflict management in distributed teams. At the same time, the course exposes the students to industrial PLM and teamwork software. In this, different fields of expertise are combined, within the teams where members have different mind-sets, different point of views and working methods.

Although women hold roughly half of all jobs in the United States, only 24% of STEM jobs are occupied by women. The problem is even more pronounced for engineering, where women held about 12% of jobs as of 2013 (Corbett &amp; Hill, 2015). Consequently, interactive, hands-on outreach programs are a common tool used by universities to encourage interest in engineering from K–12 students. Engineering—Get Into Real Learning (E-GIRL) is a week-long, residential summer program offered by Texas Tech University for female high school students. The primary goal of the program is to help participants make informed decisions about engineering majors and careers. To this aim, the purposes of the program are: (1) to offer a platform for female high school students to learn about the various disciplines of engineering offered at Texas Tech University and other universities; (2) to provide a realistic university experience, including coursework, social, and professional development opportunities; and (3) to provide hands-on exposure to a real-world engineering problem. E-GIRL ran for the second time in the summer of 2016, based on the favorable support it received in 2015. Primary components of this year’s program were a multidisciplinary group project focused on the theme of CO2 capture and storage, as well as a series of two-hour classes taught by university faculty and graduate students in the following six engineering disciplines: chemical engineering, civil engineering, environmental engineering, industrial engineering, mechanical engineering, and computer science. This paper presents the multidisciplinary structure of the program and its connection to the project that was assigned to program participants. The curriculum structure, the in-class activities, and the method of delivery for each discipline are explained in depth. The assessment of the program’s second year, including comparisons to the results from the first year and modifications to the program based on feedback from previous program participants, are discussed. Assessment was conducted through engineering skills assessment questionnaires, which required students to self-evaluate their competence in 18 skill sets before and after the program. These skill sets are qualities often identified to be important for engineers, and encompass traits associated with problem solving, project management, teamwork, and communication skills. Key results show improved self-assessment for most of the engineering skills after the program. Additionally, the skills that did not show improved self-assessment ratings after the program were consistent throughout both years. Qualitative results show a more matured and complete understanding of engineering and the individual engineering disciplines upon completion of the program. Through oral presentations, participants demonstrated in-depth engagement with the environmental conservation theme of the project. The environmental conservation theme is consistent with the participants’ aspirations for considering an engineering career and championing sustainability, which was highlighted by program participants in 2015 as a desired additional focus of the program. Overall, the program provided an opportunity for participants to experience the multidisciplinary nature of engineering, aided participants’ understanding of the roles of individual engineering disciplines, and furnished a realistic preview of student life in a university. © 2018, Purdue University Press.

Some of these studies suggest, among other things, aspects of socio-economic perception to explain this phenomenon. In this research we want to offer a new angle of debate focused on the results of the training process by using PBL case of study in Systems Engineering grade. We were interested in exploring the generation of competencies by gender. The Tuning Latin America project, which was originated in its European counterpart, represented an effort to locate generic and disciplinary competencies of computer science practitioners with the participation of 14 universities in the region. In this study we explore the state of internalization of disciplinary and generic skills in systems engineering students based on their life histories by considering the gender perspective. The main research method used was content analysis of approximately 150 life histories of systems engineering students. Previously, a set of disciplinary and generic skills was defined based on the classification of such skills included in the Tuning Latin America project. Interviews and focus groups sessions were also used in order to validate information. The results indicate several interesting aspects. The main competence identified by men is the disciplinary competence ""Apply knowledge of computer science"" and for women it was a generic competence called “the teamwork ability”. The results also show evidence that the PBL and management by competencies can help visibility of competencies something that regular Systems Engineering students would not consider, especially in the case of men, who in spite of consider first some disciplinary competences, they tend to put other generic competencies in second place. This aspect, which seems not related to gender stereotypes, could also be other attractive factor to motivate women to enter Systems Engineering education. Finally, this study not only points out the differences, but also the common elements in the teaching-learning process of engineering, such as the balance between both groups of competencies. Both male and female students using the PBL and a competencies approach, show the importance of a balance between technical and generic skills, a situation that guarantees job and social integration for future professionals. © 2018, University of Minho.

In reality, such projects are carried out by a small group of advanced students and produced in a single batch, and hence there is only a minimal educational effect from such practical endeavours. At the same time, modern specialists of satellite-based technologies should have advanced skills in spacecraft design. Small dimensions and volumes impose significant restrictions on the spacecraft configuration. This problem requires a designer of cyberphysical system to be qualified according to the new demands specified by the fourth industrial revolution. In the report we propose a new concept of end-to-end education of specialists in design of small satellites as cyberphysical systems. For integration of the design process of such satellites into the specialist degree educational program, a group of students with individual education plan is created on a task-specific chair. A student's task during the time of education will be to develop the engineering specification and manufacture a pico- or a nanosatellite. Of course, this task cannot be fulfilled on a stand-alone basis. This is why undergraduate students (first- and second-year students) only take part in spacecraft manufacture, but starting from the senior year of education, they start working, in the framework of term projects and home assignments, on creating the design data package for his or her own satellite. Fifth-year students begin to build their own satellites. Under this approach, students are taught in their common group and study such special courses that will be necessary for spacecraft design. As a result, continuous accumulation of experience and practical results is achieved and at least one small satellite is built per year. The results of integration of small satellites design process into the design specialist's degree educational program are demonstrated on an example of design and production processes of the Baumanets, Baumanets-2 microsatellites, the Parus- BMSTU nanosatellite of class CubeSat 1U and the Yarilo nanosatellite of class CubeSat 3U. The authors propose a systematic approach to the integration of the design phase of small spacecrafts into the design specialist's degree educational program (the specialist degree), which enables students to acquire professional engineering skills by from their involvement in the full production cycle of a spacecraft, with due account of the project conceptual design, design planning, manufacture, ground tests and operation of a spacecraft. © 2018 by the International Astronautical Federation (IAF).

The uniqueness lies on the fact that undergraduate students majoring engineering, who could be role models for high-school students conducted and implemented whole process of situational assessment and proposal development of science education. Japan and Thailand have considered scientific literacy as a basis for the countries' human resource development. Yet, despite of national policy's emphasis on science education, in real classroom situations, there seems that students have not been very much enjoying learning science. In order to overcome the situation, as part of problem-based learning (PBL) course jointly conducted by Tokyo Institute of Technology in Japan and Chulalongkorn University in Thailand, group of engineering students proposed a science education program and implemented concurrently in two countries. In so doing, following activities were conducted; 1) group discussion on science education in high school, 2) expert lectures, 3) site visits in two countries, 4) analysis through KJ method, 5) data analysis, and 6) group work. This paper summarizes assessment process for the current situation of science education in Japan and Thailand followed by its findings, and introduces alternative science education program to current teaching.

PBL is strongly fundamented in well defined principles. Thus, it is fundamentally important that teachers and students implement PBL in conformity to its principles. Once these principles are addressed, PBL brings a collaborative and interactive learning process between all participants. On the other hand, many teachers and students implement PBL without the necessary theoretical and practical base for the educational changes and appropriate technology resource support, putting PBL's quality and authenticity at risk, making it less efficient. In the attempt to overcome these challenges, this paper presents the usage of a virtual learning environment called PBL-Coach, which promoted technological support to an array of actions based in the principles and characteristics originated from learning theories about PBL in a year 8 class of Physics at Tara International School, in Raison, Himachal Pradesh, India, with the objective of helping teachers and students in the implementation of an authentic learning process with useful and relevant technological support. The implementation of PBL at Tara International School brought satisfactory results, reflected in the students' high level of learning, which was demonstrated in the 360 degrees evaluation and in que quality of the solutions for the problem. This experience was also inspiring for other teachers and students that became involved with the methodology. Since this was a short term learning experience implemented for children, only a full 3-week PDCA cycle was executed, along with metrics such the students' performance and understanding, the curriculum exploring and teamwork, problem resolution, presentation and 360 degree evaluation. © 2017 IEEE.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","Proc.

The development of this ability is however not prominent in engineering education despite numerous authors suggesting open-ended problems as a pedagogical tool to promote development of collaborative problem solving competence by including elements of group or project work in courses. In our own long experience of using open-ended problems in collaborative student projects, we have identified a lack of systematic progression in learning outcomes and skill development. We see this as a major obstacle for fully exploiting the potentials of using open-ended problems as an educational tool. We present a framework that provides a structured view of challenges related to openness that students can encounter in educational projects and that has an impact on the overall complexity of the project. We argue that there are different categories of openness to consider when designing educational settings based on open-ended projects. The categories addressed in this paper are: Character of the problems addressed. Character of the teams. Time constraints. Faculty involvement. External factors. Aspects of openness in the different categories are presented and related to professional engineering competencies. Furthermore, it is discussed how variations in project complexity can be accomplished by variations within the aspects and combinations of aspects. In particular, the framework addresses development and progression of professional competencies. © 2017 IEEE.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","Proc. Front. Educ. Conf.

This ability to work collaboratively can be as important to a project's success as their technical skills. Traditionally in STEM education, these collaborative skills are developed in a capstone course which mimics an industry experience. These experiences are invaluable in preparing students for the collaborative real-world nature of industry; however, these experiences can also be very stressful for students in dysfunctional teams with members who haven't developed necessary social, technical or teamwork skills. Although students may be exposed to some team-based activities in previous courses, it is not clear that this piecemeal exposure teaches students to work in teams effectively. Flipped classroom and active learning attempt to fill this gap by exposing students to peer learning earlier in the curriculum. However, these techniques are peppered throughout the curriculum and may not target all the skills necessary for teamwork. Design patterns in education formalize pedagogical approaches. But, applying design patterns without an intended progression or overarching goal may not lead students to successfully adopt these skills. Design patterns have the potential to scaffold students' development throughout the curriculum, but only if staged effectively and systematically. In this paper, we propose Spectrums and Dependency Graphs to ensure that students are prepared for each new design pattern as they experience it. Spectrums can plot design patterns along a continuum between introductory and capstone courses. Dependency graphs recursively specify patterns that prepare students for subsequent patterns. Each pattern will contain prerequisite skills or experiences that students have demonstrated in a previous pattern. In this way, students are systematically progressed from introductory to capstone courses. Through these two models, we attempt to get a better overview of the curriculum and create progressions through that curriculum that ensure students are prepared at each level, building on previous skills. © 2017 IEEE.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","Proc.

In most cases, this was not due to a lack of technical knowledge but rather from deficiencies in professional development skills. However, students are not often exposed to or taught these professional development skills in their undergraduate courses. This creates a deficiency in students' effective leadership of their teams, which can lead to a negative experience for the student in the program.

The desire to allow students to learn in a manner that closely resembles the way in which expertise is developed outside the academic environment is a central element of problem-based, inquiry-based and project-based learning. Exploring the implications of authenticity for student achievement and the ways in which this should be assessed has led to innovative teaching methods and ways of evaluating student performance. Unfortunately, authenticity, and authentic assessment in particular, are concepts which are open to a range of interpretations, not least in an educational context where they may be used by both teachers and students with a variety of meanings. This paper investigates the working definitions of authentic assessment used by teaching staff within a Computing department in one U.K. university. We begin by giving an overview of some relevant aspects of authentic learning, which, historically, draws on pedagogies such as situated learning and social learning theory. We then focus on authenticity in the assessment process and describe a number of models which have been used to identify elements that contribute to this range of meaning. We analyse the descriptions of authentic assessment given by academic staff in terms of these concepts and suggest a framework which can be used to integrate the responses and characterise staff understanding of the authenticity. We then briefly compare these findings with other work investigating student responses to the same question and draw conclusions concerning the relevance of these factors on curriculum development, the use of assessment to drive learning and the role of staff development in promoting positive change in these areas. Finally, we make suggestions for further work. © 2017 IEEE.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","Proc. Front. Educ. Conf.

However, assessments may not necessarily lead to an effective understanding of student's errors. Most assessors are required to measure the extent of student's accurate output in terms of exam answers or practical assessments. Areas of failure tend to be overlooked and for this reason, learners at-risk of achieving poor results can become careless when completing assessments. In the present study, we examine the following research questions: (i) How can we simulate the landscape of data on both individual and team behaviour in terms of failure in their projects? (ii) How can we develop ways of identifying at-risk students in each team and support them immediately? Therefore, in order to address this problem, this research proposes an agent-based simulation of student projects, which considers both individual and team errors. This model is created on the basis of particular characteristics of individual learners within the team. We assume that individuals working within a team are subject to recognition-primed decision making when confronted with particular problems to solve. The adjustment proposed by this model includes analysing the problem using prior knowledge and planning as well as judgements on the suitability of particular solutions. This research will be further developed to identify at-risk learners in terms of investigating the areas they want to develop to achieve their learning goals in particular subjects and especially in the software development fields. © 2017 IEEE.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","IEEE Int.

In the social activity, students are required to collect feedback and try to demonstrate to people online. In teaching project goal, learners work together and learn to establish big project as team work. In the final stage, each group should accomplish the news express design within 2 hours and publishing to social Web site.

The solution is intended to be sustainable and appropriate for people concerned with eating healthy, fresh food. The project was developed by a team of five students enrolled in the European Project Semester (EPS) at the Instituto Superior de Engenharia do Porto (ISEP) during the spring of 2017. EPS@ISEP is a project-based learning framework which aims to foster personal, teamwork and multidisciplinary problem-solving skills in engineering, business and product design students. Research and discussions within the team were done to develop the product. The existing solutions for growing fresh food in industrial and domestic applications as well as marketing, sustainability and ethical topics were researched and discussed. This way it was possible to define the requirements of The GreenHouse. The GreenHouse is semi-automatic and requires little interaction from the customer. It has two covers, a winter cover and a summer cover, to be changed depending on the season and weather. Solar energy and rainwater are used to enable the growth of aromatic plants, making this a sustainable system. The support is adaptable and made to fit different support sizes so it can be hanged on balconies or windows. © 2017 Association for Computing Machinery.","Association for Computing Machinery","ACM Int.

The success of TBL approach depends on its design comprising Team formation, Project identification and distribution, monitoring the progress, maintaining open discussion in every phase and peer evaluation. This paper presents the case study TBL design done for minor project course. First step, the team formation plays a very important role in projects. Therefore the teams are formed based on the complementary skills of the student and ensuring that each team has an expert member in every identified skill. The next step is project distribution, while distributing the project the team strength is calculated and accordingly the problem statements are assigned. Also to increase the motivation and learning in the team, open discussions are held where each team can review and critic other teams work in every phase. The last part in the TBL is assessment and evaluation, which is incomplete without including peer evaluation. Although the Team work is evaluated by the instructor, the individual evaluation is done by both instructor as well as peer students within the team. This TBL design has improved the team's performance and each individual is able to work better in a team. Here students could successfully build and lunch mobile app as a product. The paper gives results of various TBL components.

This paper presents results of a specific engineering project case supervised by the authors. Within the project, students got an opportunity to practice engineering skills without sacrificing the time needed for a company-based internship. During a 6-month project, a group of interdisciplinary students designed an instrument as specified by the industrial project partner. Participation in the project was optional and organised as a student’s side activity. The project was stimulating development of a range of engineering competences and soft skills among the participants. The participating students showed an above-average commitment and responsibility, fulfilling the specified project goals.

Results: The scores of analytical reasoning and all-round ability test in experimental group were higher than in control group. There was a significant difference of scores between two groups (P<0.05). Relative to the traditional teaching method, PBL mode was beneficial to improve students' innovation ability, including capabilities of self-directed learning, problem analysis, information retrieval, teamwork, critical thinking, imagination, etc. More important, students who insisted on studying subsequent courses by using PBL got a sustainable development of innovation ability. Conclusion: PBL mode is a more effective and feasible method for the cultivation of innovation ability than traditional teaching mode of digital image processing course. © 2016 IEEE.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","Proc. - Int.

Project-based learning (PBL) appears as one of the most interesting instructional strategies, the PBL strategy tries to engage students in authentic real-world tasks to enhance learning, PBL is a student-centered strategy that fosters student initiative and focuses the student on real-world, open-ended projects that can increase the motivation for most of them, these projects foster a wide range of abilities including knowledge and practical skills. Two tools were designed to help the students to study MCU based on PBL: a virtual Proteus simulation and a real setup. Using Proteus VSM, software development can begin as soon as the schematic is drawn, and the combination of hardware and software can be thoroughly tested before physical prototype is constructed. The combination of virtual and real setups can realize seamless connection between theory and practice, both virtual and real setups are described by example, and the results obtained by the students are discussed. Students gain hands-on experience, and also improve their skill in product development, self-directed learning, teamwork, and project management. Practical projects increase the challenge for students and, hence, their interest level. The results show that the students valued both tools and were able to address MCU problems at a high cognitive level. © 2017 IEEE.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","Proc.

Improvements in this area are possible if we acquire knowledge of how these tools are used in practice and what problems or challenges need to be addressed in the future. Therefore we conducted an exploratory semi-structured interview study investigating in what manner common project-management-tools are used in the particular phases and meetings of an agile development process. We have interviewed five experienced agile coaches that guided projects with different constellations regarding the number of involved agile teams and their locations. As a first result we summarized and structured our findings according to all steps of an agile process in the form of textual descriptions and diagrams. Thereby we focused on the combined usage of digitial project-managementtools and traditional paper-based media.

If such groups become unviable, for instance due to interpersonal conflict or imbalanced effort, intervention by the lecturer may be required to alleviate this problem. The article proposes Collaboration Viability (CoVi) as a construct to indicate the degree to which a team is failing. Peer assessment instruments are designed to establish the relative contributions of team members, but are rarely used to measure emergent group-level properties, such as CoVi. Averaged per-group peer assessment ratings from 458 undergraduate engineers (forming 72 teams) demonstrated an overall weak, but statistically significant, correlation between CoVi and their group mark (r = 0.25, p = 0.04), adjusting for academic ability. A Self and Peer Assessment Resource Kit (SPARKPLUS) online instrument was used that comprised 13 questions, categorised according to whether they related to contribution, competence or teamwork. Individual questions were unevenly correlated with performance, which based upon general principles of survey design, was postulated to be attributable to poor design of some of the questions. It was further postulated that the cumulative effect of poor question design was respondent’s disengagement from the instrument. Consequently, to improve the peer assessment methodology employed for this research, a novel, three-step process was recommended. First, a short, non-divisive instrument measuring peer’s-perception of collaboration; second, intervention by the lecturer of low-CoVi groups; and third, in recidivist groups, as SPARKPLUS currently does, application of a validated peer assessment instrument to algorithmically adjust marks. © 2018 Engineers Australia.","Taylor and Francis Ltd.","Australasian Journal of Engineering Education",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85044377268

We used the mHealth domain as the context for an interdisciplinary learning experience for pharmacy and computer science and software engineering (CSSE) students. Educational activity Educational activities focused on creating an mHealth course sequence and an mHealth application (app). Students worked in teams to complete various assignments, including developing and presenting a course proposal, building a purchase plan for mHealth equipment, developing an mHealth app prototype, delivering a disease state presentation (pharmacy students only), developing use case scenarios (CSSE students only), and completing peer evaluations. Critical analysis of the educational activity Course evaluations were only available from pharmacy students. They indicated an overall favorable rating (mean 3.27–3.55; 4=strongly agree).

However, group dynamics vary, ranging from equitable collaboration to dysfunctional groups dominated by one individual. To explore how group dynamics impact student learning, we asked students in a large-enrollment university biology class to self-report their experience during in-class group work. Specifically, we asked students whether there was a friend in their group, whether they were comfortable in their group, and whether someone dominated their group. Surveys were administered after students participated in two different types of intentionally constructed group activities: 1) a loosely-structured activity wherein students worked together for an entire class period (termed the ‘single-group’ activity), or 2) a highly-structured ‘jigsaw’ activity wherein students first independently mastered different subtopics, then formed new groups to peer-teach their respective subtopics. We measured content mastery by the change in score on identical pre-/post-tests. We then investigated whether activity type or student demographics predicted the likelihood of reporting working with a dominator, being comfortable in their group, or working with a friend. We found that students who more strongly agreed that they worked with a dominator were 17.8% less likely to answer an additional question correct on the 8-question post-test. Similarly, when students were comfortable in their group, content mastery increased by 27.5%. Working with a friend was the single biggest predictor of student comfort, although working with a friend did not impact performance. Finally, we found that students were 67% less likely to agree that someone dominated their group during the jigsaw activities than during the single group activities. We conclude that group activities that rely on positive interdependence, and include turn-taking and have explicit prompts for students to explain their reasoning, such as our jigsaw, can help reduce the negative impact of inequitable groups. © 2017 Theobald et al.

The approach taken is a blending of directed problem-solving activities in a collaborative learning environment coupled with Team Challenges through which groups of four freshmen engineering students engage in actively constructing systems for solving practical engineering problems. This approach brings to students a vibrant, interactive approach to learning about chemical and petroleum engineering fundamentals at a time when individual anticipation (and anxiety) about studying engineering is perhaps at its highest. Offered in a two-day per week format, course activities are structured to engage students in problem-solving strategies one day per week with the hands-on Team Challenges the second day each week. Significant course content and mentoring is provided outside of class in a ""flippedclassroom"" style. By assembling and testing a variety of simple engineering systems, students learn about engineering applications of math and science principles. Examples of systems studied include the development of a centrifugal pump curve using a simple, inexpensive apparatus; investigating level-control for continuous flow into and out of a small tank using LEGO NXT™ controllers/sensors; evaluating performance of a double-pipe heat exchanger using Vernier™ meters and sensors; and assessing performance of a simple wind turbine as a function of changes in various parameters such as blade design, wind speed, etc. Individual students are provided an opportunity to quickly build relationships and skills for teamwork, leadership and collaboration along with gaining an understanding of designing experiments, collecting and analyzing data, and contextualizing the meaning of the work within a broader focus on the practice of engineering. Student enrollment in the two semester course sequence has grown significantly over the years since its inception in 2006 from an enrollment between 30-40 students each semester to a high of 173 in the fall 2015 semester. The evolution of the course and adaptations for large student enrollment is discussed. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2017.","American Society for Engineering Education","ASEE Annu.

The authors propose a process for facilitating team creation in an organic fashion amongst students by collecting and providing information about student interest on a per project basis as well as on each student's skills. This allows students to gauge the interest levels of potential teammates for projects they are interested in as well and choose teammates that have complementary skills, thus maximizing their potential for success.

Choosing a major can be a daunting task for firstyear college students, especially if the choices span fields with which students have little experience. In order to provide first-year engineering students time to discern, a set of resources and course activities were designed to assist students in this decision-making process. The educational theory that serves as a framework for this study is social cognitive career theory, developed by Lent, Brown, and Hackett in 1994. In particular, resources, activities, and experiences in the introduction to engineering course were designed to assist students with self-efficacy beliefs and personal goals. At this University all engineering and computer science students take an introduction to engineering course that covers the engineering process, teamwork, communication skills, the different branches of engineering, ethics, and co-curricular and extracurricular opportunities. Section sizes are ∼30 students, so students can build community with peers and their professor. The professor of the Introduction to Engineering course is the academic advisor for his/her set of students. Students declare or confirm their major by the end of the first semester. Resources to help students choose a major include laboratories, advisor meetings, student panels, a semesterlong team project, student chapters of professional society meetings, and on-line resources. In the fall 2012 offering of the course, we collected paper surveys from students, asking them to rate the effectiveness of a suite of resources in helping them choose their major. We asked about exposure to engineering and/or computer science prior to entering college and course materials and activities that were helpful for selecting a major. Based on the responses, we created a new set of videos and blogs featuring upper-class students who shared their journeys in how they chose their major and what they value about their major. We added new labs for the 2015 version. In fall 2015, we again asked students about the impact of all the course activities and their confidence in their major selection. The professor as advisor, laboratories and the course project have the most impact on helping students decide their major. More informational activities such as talking to other students, attending club meetings, and watching videos of other students had less impact. Based on these results, students seem to need personal, hands-on experience to determine if their self-efficacy beliefs and the values of the outcomes align with the intended major. 145 of 154 (94.2%) of students were somewhat or very confident about their major at the end of the semester. This paper describes a suite of resources and activities along with students' evaluation of those materials in terms of discernment of their major. By disseminating the information, other universities can adopt and adapt these activities to use in their programs. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2017.","American Society for Engineering Education","ASEE Annu.

This is compounded when the team is comprised of students from multiple engineering disciplines. Our engineering capstone curriculum has always included training on team dynamics and team conflict that has been taught by the capstone engineering professors. Three years ago, we decided to bring in outside experts to lecture on topics such as project management, ethics and standards to augment the training for our capstone students. The following year we decided to extend this concept and turned to experts trained in the field of business communications to better train students in how to effectively operate as a team. This paper describes an ongoing pilot project to integrate professional training on team dynamics, team conflict and team leadership into our existing engineering capstone curriculum. Business Communications professors from the School of Management developed curriculum and presented to engineering students in the Biomedical and Mechanical Engineering departments. The initial single training session two years ago on all these topics has expanded into multiple training sessions - one on team charters and team dynamics, a second session on team conflict and resolution and a third on formal presentation training. A ""Team Health Checklist"" has been developed to quickly gather feedback from the team members on their impressions about how their team is functioning. The Team Health Checklist is completed by all students during the second training session, and the results are tabulated to provide an assessment of team progress. Finally, all of the project team leaders attend a fourth training session/roundtable on team leadership in small groups to discuss issues without the engineering professors present. The results and comments from the Team Health Checklist are discussed with the team leaders, and coaching is provided to help them improve as leaders. We will also discuss the results of the survey we have administered which has helped us determine the effectiveness of this professional training program. The survey focuses on each team member's impression of the change in attitudes, communications and abilities of the team before and after the training. Team leaders complete an additional section of the survey focused on their impressions of how and if the training has helped them perform better as the leader of the team. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2017.","American Society for Engineering Education","ASEE Annu.

Although women hold roughly half of all jobs in the United States, only 24% of STEM jobs are occupied by women. The problem is even more pronounced for engineering, where women held about 12% of jobs as of 20133. Consequently, interactive, hands-on outreach programs are a common tool used by universities to encourage interest in engineering from K-12 students. Engineering-Get Into Real Learning (E-GIRL) is a week-long, residential summer program offered by Texas Tech University for female high school students. The primary goal of the program is to help participants make informed decisions about engineering majors and careers. To this aim, the purposes of the program are: 1) to offer a platform for female high school students to learn about the various disciplines of engineering offered at Texas Tech University and other universities; 2) to provide a realistic university experience, including coursework, social, and professional development opportunities; and 3) to provide hands-on exposure to a real-world engineering problem. E-GIRL ran for the second time in the summer of 2016 based on the favorable support it received in 2015. Primary components of this year's program were a multidisciplinary group project focused on the theme of CO2 capture and storage as well as a series of two-hour classes taught by university faculty and graduate students in the following six engineering disciplines: chemical engineering, civil engineering, environmental engineering, industrial engineering, mechanical engineering, and computer science. This paper presents the multidisciplinary structure of the program and how it connects to the project that was assigned to program participants. The curriculum structure, the in-class activities, and the method of delivery for each discipline are explained in depth. The assessment of the program's second year, including comparisons to the results from the first year and modifications to the program based on feedback from previous program participants are discussed. The assessment instruments include engineering skills assessment questionnaires requiring students to self-evaluate their competence in eighteen skillsets before the program and after the program. These skillsets are qualities often identified to be important for engineers and encompass traits associated with problem solving, project management, teamwork, and communication skills. Key results show improved self-assessment for most of the engineering skills after the program. Additionally, the skills which did not show improved self-assessment ratings after the program were consistent throughout both years. Qualitative results show a more matured and complete understanding - after the program - of engineering and the individual engineering disciplines. Through oral presentations, participants demonstrated in-depth engagement with the environmental conservation theme of the project. The environmental conservation theme is consistent with the participants' aspirations for considering an engineering career and championing sustainability, which was highlighted by program participants in 2015 as a desired additional focus of the program. Overall, the program provided an opportunity for participants to experience the multidisciplinary nature of engineering, aided participants' understanding of the roles of the individual engineering disciplines, and furnished a realistic preview of student life in a university. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2017.","American Society for Engineering Education","ASEE Annu.

One way to overcome this challenge is to provide students with an authentic team project experience. Authentic student projects are those that are as close as possible to real projects in terms of uncertainty, complexity and diversity. In order to achieve this, collaboration with business and other external stakeholders is essential. However, such collaboration is often hindered by constraints around team structure, team and individual student assessment, the use of specific processes and technology, providing technical and other support, and fixed project durations. In this paper, we present a simple course structure and assessment process that has allowed us to remove the majority of such constraints, while maintaining integrity around student learning and assessment. By removing these constraints, we are providing students with authentic team project experiences that prepare them well for future employment. Preliminary evaluations of our approach indicate that despite several challenges, the experience has led to high levels of satisfaction among students and our external partners including employers. © 2017 IEEE.","IEEE Computer Society","IEEE Global Eng.

However, they lack of entrepreneurship skills and business minded orientation. Moreover, even if courses such as Management and Entrepreneurship are part of the curriculum, students view these subjects uninteresting due to a lack of practical component [1]. Young people need the opportunity to sharpen their skills so that they can quickly join the job market [2]. This paper describes an altered version of the Project Based Learning method (PBL), as a suggestion for developing entrepreneurship skill to students, based on their ideas and interests. The proposed method was used in two educational projects implemented by Applied Informatics in Business and Economy students. The assessment of hard and soft skills development was performed through written tests, interviews and 360 degrees feedback from the participants. The final results were very promising, depicting that 80% of the participants made it through the program successfully. Moreover, they felt confident enough for their knowledge and capable to start their own business. An interesting finding was that 40% of the students were already building a team to start developing their own product. They all believed that their entrepreneurial skills were developed. In addition to that, written tests showed that their hard skills have also been enhanced. Even though the economic environment of Greece is aggressive to entrepreneurship [3], a year after the projects were concluded, 20% of the participants were still trying to build their own business by developing their own product. It is the first time, to the best of the authors' knowledge, that technology and informatics are used as means to enhance entrepreneurship in Greece, starting from concept and ending to the actual promotion of an actual product (prototype). © 2017 IEEE.","IEEE Computer Society","IEEE Global Eng.

In addition the shaping of different behavioral skills and competencies is added as well. Finally student would gain not only the expert knowledge but additionally behavioral skills, like teamwork capabilities, together with the business related knowledge and skills like art of presentation and giving elevator pitches.

It is proven that it develops practical skills and allows to look at the different situations, from cultural and economic perspective. In addition it shows different possibilities of solving problems based on real-life situations. However, the case teaching method is used mainly in law, medicine and business education. There are not many examples of its implementation in engineering courses. This is due to several problems related to specifics of technical sciences.

Smart electronic product design must be a truly interdisciplinary process, in which technologists are aware of how much their decisions impact the user-product relationship and designers understand the full potential and associated limitations of technology involved. Shared knowledge and communication are essential in this scenario, but, due to their technological limitations, designers are often excluded from high-level decision processes.

This emerging capstone experience demands academic and administrative changes to guarantee a satisfactory result within the time spared for this purpose. The main objective of this research is to assess students' perception regarding the capstone project as a culminating academic experience, and to use the analysis results to propose academic and administrative changes required to support and guarantee the successful achievement of this type of final degree project. To reach this goal, an assessment instrument was prepared and applied to 47 students enrolled in a capstone course. The instrument allowed collecting information regarding problem-based learning experience, teamwork experience, and self-perception concerning students' own behaviors and attitude during teamworking. On this regard, 87.2% of students considered capstone as a suitable final degree experience; however, it is challenging because it is known that student's participation during teamworking is uncommon and usually just two students are committed. In spite of this, 86.2% of students considered that teamwork was satisfactory and 95.2% of them recognized that their self-behavior and attitude during teamworking was good. Based on the results we recommend to strengthen teamwork strategies among students, and to instruct teachers about assessment strategies to evaluate individual and teamwork performance of students. It is expected that these findings can help improve the capstone curriculum related to courses and their administration. These findings are also supposed to serve as a previous experience to those universities committed to include capstone as a culminating degree experience. © 2017 Universidad Nacional.

Maintaining a ""STEM-interested"" student body can potentially have significant long-term implications for the success of the future STEM workforce. In many cases, students who initially like STEM subjects begin to lose interest in STEM subjects during middle school years. This work-in-progress paper explores the findings of the second year of STEM-Inc, an afterschool program in junior high schools that combines team-based, real-world engineering and computer science projects with business entrepreneurship concepts. One of the important goals of the program is to sustain student interest in STEM subjects and make them aware of STEM careers. Participants are supervised by college student mentors in partnership with school teachers. Traditionally underrepresented students form a significant component of STEM-Inc. While interest in STEM activities, teamwork and entrepreneurial confidence for students were positively influenced in year 2, no significant improvements were observed in STEM skills and interest in STEM fields. STEM-Inc also had considerable positive influences on college student mentors and school teachers. Two mentors reported that they are considering a career in STEM education after their involvement in STEM-Inc. School teachers reported being confident in the inclusion of engineering examples and the design process in their math and science courses. © 2017 IEEE.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","ISEC - Proc.

Purpose: The study aims to understand how seventh grade students perceive a collaborative web-based science project in light of Wolff’s design categories. The goal of the project is to develop their technological and collaborative skills, to educate them about technology integration practices, and to provide an optimum collaborative, PBL experience. Sample: Seventh grade students aged 12–14 (n = 15) were selected from a rural K–12 school in Turkey through purposeful sampling. Design and methods: The current study applied proactive action research since it focused on utilizing a new way to enhance students’ technological and collaborative skills and to demonstrate technology integration into science coursework. Data were collected qualitatively through interviews, observation forms, forum archives, and website evaluation rubrics. Results: The results found virtual spaces such as online tutorials, forums, and collaborative and communicative tools to be beneficial for collaborative PBL. The study supported Wolff’s design features for a collaborative PBL environment, applying features appropriate for a rural K–12 school setting and creating a digitally-enriched environment. As the forum could not be used as effectively as expected because of school limitations, more flexible spaces independent of time and space were needed. Conclusions: This study’s interdisciplinary, collaborative PBL was efficient in enhancing students’ advanced technological and collaborative skills, as well as exposing them to practices for integrating technology into science. The study applied design features for a collaborative PBL environment with certain revisions. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Routledge","Res. Sci. Technol.

The impact of this continuous action for many decades is inactive learners who cannot develop higher order thinking skills. Based on the performance test, students' critical thinking skill in Public Middle School 3 Pontianak was in low level although their achievement score were higher than school standards. The purpose of this study is to develop critical thinking skills of middle school students using Problem Based Learning 4 Core Areas (PBL4C). The design of this research is classroom action research with two cycles. Data has been collected using observation checklist, rating scale, self and peer assessment. Research findings reveal that students experience development from 11.11% to 88.45% in identifying the problem correctly, 37.03% to 76.92% for sub skills distinguish knowledge and opinion, 18.51% to 65.38% for sub skills providing possible solution, 22.22% to 69.23% for sub skills making decision, and 11.11% to 69.23% for sub skills identifying the impact of the implementation of their solution. In conclusion, the findings indicate that development of students' critical thinking skills occurs when PBL4C model applied in science classroom. These findings suggest that teachers should act as facilitator in a classroom as well as should provide meaningful learning resources that can benefit students' critical thinking skills. On the other hand, students should practice constantly to offer a sharp, accurate and appropriate solution. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","Institute of Physics Publishing","J.

Methodology: In the study the quantitative research was done among master degree Polish students of Management (105 questionnaires). The measures used for the study were developed specifically for the study referring to the previous research in the field. Findings: Results indicate that leaders in team projects and conditions supporting teamwork are connected with the students' perception of teamwork effectiveness, while the fairness in team projects is connected with students' preference of working collectively. Research implications: We conclude that in order to develop a positive attitude towards teamwork, the teamwork projects should be better supported by the instructors (especially supporting the emergence of leader(s) and minimising the problem of free riders) and the university should create a climate that facilitates teamworking, otherwise team projects might negatively influence students' attitude towards collective work. Value: On the labour market the teamwork skills are one of the most important skills of employees, as the team-based organizational designs are becoming the norm in work organization. The study is contributing to the understanding of the relations between student experiences and their attitudes as well as the role played by high education in the development of these attitudes. Some previous research in Anglo-Saxon culture countries indicate that team project assignments realised by students during studies might even hinder their attitudes to teamwork and their willingness to work in teams in the future. © 2018 Association for Computing Machinery.

However, conducting an accurate assessment for process feedback is not an easy task because instructors of PBL courses often have to make judgments based on a limited view of group work. In this paper, we provide explanations about how in practice instructors actually exhibit cognitive biases and judgments made using incomplete information in the context of an engineering design education classroom. More specifically, we hypothesize that instructors would be susceptible to human errors that are well known in social psychology, the halo effect and the fundamental attribution error, because they have a limited view of group work when they facilitate distributed and remote groups. Through this study, we present two main contributions, namely (1) insights based on classroom data about limitations of current instructor assessment practices, (2) an illustration of using principles from social psychology as a lens for exploring important design questions for designing tools that monitor support oversight of group work. In addition to the study, we illustrate how the findings from our classroom study can be used for effective group assessments. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Springer Netherlands","Int J Technol Des Educ",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84944705739

A study was undertaken to induce senior undergraduate students to design board games or to create animations as part of the assessment, in a subject of Information System Audit and Control. One motivation is to validate whether students who chose the said options for group project may have a better learning experience than other students who chose the traditional assessment method. The research also tries to explore the possible adoption of board games and animations as part of the subject assessment. We included both game design and animation design as group project options. After the completion of the project, we invited the students, lecturers of other courses and professionals from the industry to comment on our alternative options of the group project.

This system provides the total environment to enable automatic advice provision in real time, proper guidance by a teacher based on understanding of specific circumstances. We initially propose a mechanism for presenting the details of discussions to teachers so that they can easily understand each situation during an exercise. Our system records detailed conversations during discussions by each student group until the group's decision-making is completed. The system then presents the recorded conversations to teachers in an easily understandable manner. Moreover, our system is equipped with functions for commenting, question-and-answer sessions. These functions enable teachers to provide real-time guidance through careful monitoring of the exercise situations. Next, we carefully analyzed actual discussion data. On the basis of this analysis, we constructed a case-base for automatically generating advice, designed a way to present this advice to students.

A case is a text that describes a reallife situation providing information but not solution. Previous research shows that case-based teaching helps students to apply the principles discussed in the class for solving complex practical problems. We divide one main project into sub-projects to give to students in order to enhance their practical experience of designing a compiler. To measure the effectiveness of case-based discussions, students complete a survey on their perceptions of benefits of case-based learning. The survey is analyzed using frequency distribution and chi square test of association.

It answers the questions: What elearning platforms or applications do students use to collaborate for team projects? What technology affordance draws students to use these applications? This study adopts affordance theory as the theoretical framework. Two types of content analysis: conventional content analysis and summative content analysis were used to analyse the data. Data was gathered using a pre-designed questionnaire with the teams during the first semester of 2016. Findings show that the university's elearning platform is utilised for some of their courses; however students seem to prefer free and open source platforms. Student project teams used applications such as WhatsApp, Telegram, Dropbox, Google Drive, Google Docs, as well as email messages, to work jointly, and were successfully able to complete their team projects.

Employers find the graduates lacking in teamwork, communication and other soft skills as well as in engineering thinking, engineering intuition and higher order thinking and problem solving skills. Project based learning (PBL) appears to provide an alternative teaching process capable of addressing these employers' needs. The problem arises with implementation of PBL into existing engineering curricula, which are not flexible and easily changeable. Therefore, if full scale implementation of PBL courses is difficult, most significant advantages and barriers to implementation should be sought out. Goal of the paper was to discover the most significant advantages and disadvantages of PBLfrom the students' and professors' point of view. To that end, both students and professors were questioned on their perception of PBL from their own personal experience on a complex interdisciplinary student project. Taking into account the difference in sample sizes of the two groups, the students' opinions were collected through an online survey and the professors' through semistructured interviews and an ABC method questionnaire. Research findings from this paper may be used to determine which aspects of PBL are most suited for engineering education and conversely, which should be focused on the most. On the other hand, it is useful to know which disadvantages and barriers to implementation are the most significant and which need to be overcome first to enable PBL implementation. © 2017 TEMPUS Publications.","Tempus Publications","Int.

Then, knowledge and skills questionnaires are used to measure educational effectiveness. The results show that educational effectiveness is highest when a team consists of management and anchor types without leadership types.

This paper analyses what factors students find important within the Game Lab concept when it comes to their motivation for learning. In the Game Lab course, students are put into a situation where they have to act as an actual game company, taking on realistic industry challenges, working with actual customers and having to answer to an executive committee on a weekly basis to report on their progress. To get good grades in the course the students have to prove that they are active in the team through clear tasks and responsibility descriptions, notes on working hours, weekly follow-ups, etc. The model challenges the students in many ways. As the model has proven successful, this paper looks into what specific factors, within this project-based learning concept, seems to increase and decrease the students' motivation and learning outcomes. Based on a survey for the students, teachers and external representatives, the paper looks into what factors are more important in the success of Game Lab as a learning activity, how it should improve and how it can make impact on other similar learning activities within other educational programs. From the research it was found that social element of working together, being given the freedom to work on projects that are perceived as interesting and relevant, seeing the finalized product, being able to specialize, constructive feedback and industry relevance as motivating factors.","Academic Conferences and Publishing International Limited","Proc.

A problem-based learning approach is one of the applicable solutions to strengthen IT student capabilities in critical thinking, problem solving, soft skill such as communication, leadership and team-work skills. Educational Institutions can produce students with the ability of critical thinking, creative and innovative through soft skill. This soft skill is crucial in preparing IT students with honorable values which later may contribute to the success of Malaysian Vision 2020 to increase skilled worker with soft skill ability. To date, there is a lack of statistical evidence to show IT student's perception of IT courses related to PBL characteristics, PBL assessment and PBL practices. Therefore, this study aims to identify the PBL success factors of IT courses. The survey technique was applied in this study. The self-administered questionnaires were distributed to 119 IT students who had experienced in PBL. The results of reliability test showed the Cronbach's alpha value for the questionnaire is 0.983. The findings from a descriptive analysis of the PBL characteristics, PBL assessment, PBL practices and PBL perception show that the critical success factors of IT courses that highlighted by the respondents with the mean value of 4 are self-assessment (one of the sub-factor of PBL assessment), Roles of facilitator (one of the sub-factor of PBL Characteristics) constructism and group activity (two sub-factors of PBL practices). These findings may contribute the IT educators in improving their PBL implementation for IT courses and also to the PBL researchers in improving the existing PBL models. © Medwell journals, 2017.","Medwell Journals","J.

This paper describes the experience gained while teaching mobile apps development as a subject in a Computer Science engineering curriculum for three academic years. We provide a description of the teaching and assessment processes adopted, based on a Problem Based Learning (PBL) approach and a weighted self/peer/teacher assessment schema respectively, tackling the main issues that arise when considering these methodologies. Throughout these three course editions a total of 37 students have followed the subject and instructors have given them a great degree of freedom to propose their own projects. This has led to a high degree of motivation and ambition, and it has been rarely necessary to push any additional functionality into their initial proposals. Moreover, the projects as a whole have covered not only a good sample of the most important mobile computing aspects but also very different application areas. On top of this, we have also analyzed the implications of introducing peer-and self-assessment components into the evaluation system. In this respect, we have concluded that not only peer-but also self-assessment can be acceptably close and correlated to the marks given by the teachers. We believe that our observations, results and experiences could be useful in inspiring other teachers when designing other higher education courses (or parts of them), especially those sharing the basic characteristics of those described in this work. © 2017 Tempus Publications.","Tempus Publications","Int.

Design/methodology/approach: This mixed methods study asked instructors experienced in using group work to sequentially respond to weekly instalments of reflective journal entries representing a fictional member of a collaborative learning group working through a group project. A web-based instrument captured quantitative and qualitative data during the first phase where instructors worked on their own and in the second phase where participants used a think-aloud protocol while engaging in the same task. The data were analysed to understand their professional vision (what they notice and how they make sense of it as well as consistency across instructors) for collaborative group projects. Findings: This study found that instructors were consistent neither in what they noticed nor in how they made sense of what they perceived. This resulted in a tendency not to label dysfunctional groups as such. Social implications: If the instructors lack professional vision for group projects, the students are unlikely to learn to work in groups and the instructors will find it difficult to seek help and learn from one another. Originality/value: This is an exploratory study because there was minimal extant research on the topic. Methods included the use of narrative fiction and a remote think-aloud protocol. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.","Emerald Group Publishing Ltd.","J. Appl. Res. High.

The situation is more complex in collaborative settings involving teamwork, such as project-based learning, where student assessment considers the group as a single entity, disregard of in-dividual contributions to the team. Furthermore, most often only the final deliv-erable is taken into account when assessing teamwork in collaborative learning, leading to a loss of perspective about the whole process and whether or not team-work is effectively happening. This research aims to provide a comprehensive selection of log-based information from LMS databases that could serve as po- Tential indicators to perform learning analytics and assess teamwork in online learning. The proposal of this novel and theory-grounded framework understands the multidimensional nature of teamwork, considers different sets of indicators for each of its dimensions-communication, cooperation, coordination, and mon-itoring and tracking- And incorporates the temporal dimension of activity data. This proposal sets the basis for future software development to effectively trans-form LMS log-based data and provide actionable measures of teamwork using learning analytics.","CEUR-WS","CEUR Workshop Proc.",Conference Paper,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85030102608

Framed by an authentic project, namely planning a robotic mission inside the nuclear reactor at Fukushima to measure radioactivity, teams of students were charged to develop a path plan for a robot. Only limited training was provided about teamwork but the designed tasks promoted working in teams. Various instruments were used to assess the students' perception and readiness to collaboration. It was interesting to observe how the tools showed poor correlations between each other and especially the final grades in Physics and Math. Qualitative data from weekly journals and focus group meetings clearly showed that students understand the value of teamwork but subsequent classes need to provide opportunities strengthen their initial skills.

PBL originated some 45 years ago in medical education at universities in McMaster (Canada), Maastricht (Netherlands) and Newcastle (Australia) and since then has gained popularity worldwide in many professional disciplinary fields. The PBL approach, as presented in literature, supports a shift from teacher-directed, or centred, learning to facilitation of students' learning, thus shifting the focus to students' learning. Facilitation, as practiced in PBL, involves a different style of teaching compared to traditionally accepted styles, and from the experience of both students and lecturers, brings with its adoption challenges. Importantly, a skilled PBL facilitator, who issecurein their role, can contribute significantly to the effectiveness of PBL groups' work and thus to students' learning. This paper reports on a qualitative study, and its findings, concerning the experiences of academic staff and students atone institution, the German Malaysian Institute (GMI), in Malaysia. During interviews and focus groups, lecturers and students identified the challenges that lecturers face in effectively facilitating PBL. Analyses revealed two major themes that inhibit success: lecturers' and students' adaptation to PBL. These findings provide interesting insights into what is required to adapt to this mode of delivery. © 2017 TEMPUS Publications.","Tempus Publications","Int. J. Eng.

The study attempted to address two hypotheses: 1) that increased proficiency in projects skills (Database Software skills) will contribute to greater project quality and 2) that increased proficiency within the virtual environment will contribute to greater project quality. Findings suggest that technical proficiencies in projects skills do contribute to greater project quality however the technical proficiency in the use of virtual environments does not. The relationship between proficiency in project skills and the quality of project outcomes is weak; suggesting that other variables not investigated in this study may exert a more powerful influence on project outcomes.

All over the world social media are changing the way of communication, information sharing, reporting, marketing and many other sectors. Therefore it is no surprise that more and more frequently they find use in tuition students of all ages but most noticeable in higher education. Teachers generally implement social media into education to improve the availability of study materials and increase their active self-study. In most cases it is only the technology that students are commonly using in their private life and they have to learn to use them effectively during their studies. Few studies have doubts about the benefits of using social media as a learning tool, but vast majority of existing studies demonstrate the efficiency and benefits of social media implemented in education. Social media also provides many new possibilities to gather information and they also connect formal and informal educational process. This paper describes the use of social media during work on group design projects solved under the subjects taught at the University of West Bohemia in Pilsen (UWB) at the Faculty of Mechanical Engineering (FME) in the Department of Machine Design (DMD). Teaching of these subjects is based on Project Based Learning (PBL). Students have to design the entire structure of the specific component, equipment, tool or machine within study of these subjects. To solvethis design problems, students are motivated to use all of the above mentioned technologies for effective group communication, data sharing, planning, information gathering and anything else what social media enable. All problems, processes and procedures ofthe design process are monitored and recorded. These recorded data are further used by solvers of similar study projects and also projects carried out in cooperation with industrial companies. There is an effort to make these sets of information also freely available to the public via social media and open source projects.","Academic Conferences Limited","Proc. Int.

Since 1998, a German technical university developed and continually improves upon a project-oriented and problem-based learning (PPBL) model that integrates both teamwork and systems thinking (engineering design) into an intensive, immersive project week. This model was then transferred to a newly formed Mongolian university. At the beginning, German academic staff introduced the Mongolian faculty to the PPBL model and taught the course for two years. For full empowerment and transfer of procedural and informal knowledge of the PPBL model, Mongolian academic staff attended a week-long workshop to learn and adapt the German model. This past year, the course was taught by Mongolian staff with mentoring from the German faculty. Our current snapshot shows that the transfer of the German PPBL model to a Mongolian university is on the path to be successful.

To resolve this contradiction, it is necessary to generalize and develop applied aspects of the use of the Markov chains to represent and model the projects as a system of role communications in a project team. To construct a Markov chain, we used a well-known role model of a project team by R. Belbin, which represents the structure of project participants only qualitatively. We developed a graphical representation of the cognitive structure of the role model, which is similar to a directed graph with vertices - states of the project, and arcs that represent communication links between project participants. Construction of the graph enables us to create a matrix of transition probabilities for communications of a project. To finish the method of transformation of a role model, it is necessary to pass to the development of analytical stepwise method to solve the system of equations of the Markov chain with discrete states and time. It is shown that iterative solution of the system of equations of the Markov model forms a ""trajectory"" of development of virtual or actual projects based on the characteristics of role communications. The practical aspects of assessment of effectiveness of the ""trajectory"" of projects development were explored using the developed Markov model. Evaluation of results of change in the distribution of probabilities of states of a project in coordinates of probabilities of states of the system in steps revealed a significant effect on the progress and effectiveness of a project in the case of variation of competences of only one member of the team project. These results reflect the essential property of teamwork: effectiveness of projects depends on the coherence of roles of all project performers. © D. Lukianov, K. Bespanskaya-Paulenko, V.

In this course, student teams work on client-based, open-ended projects. At two points in the process, each team participates in a design review that is held outside of class, using external experts with real domain knowledge. External reviewers are critical as they: are able to apply deep domain-specific knowledge and design experience to the project challenges, reinforce the model of the design process that we teach, add credibility due to their status as design professionals, and detect weaknesses in the designs. Having outside experts also emphasizes the coaching role of instructors, as they are no longer the main audience that the team must inform and persuade. Prior to the review, students write a design brief that is required to be concise, easy-to-skim, focused on evidence-based decisions, and supported with appropriate visual elements. They also prepare and practice a short presentation aligned with the design brief. During the review, they give the presentation, use interpersonal skills to solicit feedback and guide the conversation, take detailed notes, and sketch concepts to support discussion. Our experience suggests that implementing structured design reviews with well-qualified design professionals can catalyze student achievement in project-based design courses. In addition, when the design review experience includes a series of pre- and post-review design and communication activities, it creates a common thread throughout the course that links the learning goals.","Institution of Engineering Designers, The Design Society","Proc.

Blended learning becomes the essential part of the education process. Flipped classroom is a recently emerged hybrid classroom model, which engenders tremendous interest from teachers all over the world. It demonstrates the original education approach, which combine existing components in an innovative design. The core components of flipped classroom consist of transfer of knowledge part in a video form and in-class problem-based learning part through activities and group work. The combination of different teaching approaches, within one course, adjusts to different learning styles. Having taken out the lecturing part from the class, it is used for the face-to-face communication and activities. Hence, the student-teacher interaction increases, making the learning more individual, as well as, the communication in the class becomes more intensive. Most of flipped classroom experiments study their effectiveness, focusing on students' score and satisfaction. Authors describe the significantly increased students satisfaction and slightly increased score and other parameters, comparing with traditional classroom. At the same time, they highlight numerous number of challenge and gaps in design. This systematic review focus on reported gaps, drawbacks and challenges, derived from students' and faculty' feedback. The dataset is collected from Scopus. From 1256 selected articles, 49 were rigorously reviewed. The results describe the barriers for teachers and students, divided by categories. Teachers most frequently face lack of resources, lack of skills, design gaps and evaluation issues. It is worth mentioning, that limited time is a major problem. The categories of barriers for students include design issues, technical and resources. Here resources are not so important as soon as most of students have basic equipment.

One approach is to look at the physical aspects of how students collaborate while engaged in open-ended group-work during Practice- Based Learning (PBL) activities. By analysing how students and teachers move and interact in relation to each other, the space they are in and the objects within it, we can gain a greater understanding of the physical nature of collaborative group-work. This understanding can help us to create a learning environment that intrinsically but unobtrusively supports access by all user profiles who seek to engage with it, thus promoting equity of engagement and participation. Using the example of the design of a Learning Analytics System (LAS) and the educational furniture in which it is implemented, we will show how the physical design of a CSCL implementation can support increased collaboration. © ISLS.","International Society of the Learning Sciences (ISLS)","Comput. -Supported Collab.

A total of 78 high school students from two schools participated. This study applied sequential analysis to analyze the students’ social knowledge construction and online searching behavior from a large amount of screen-recording data. Interestingly, the results indicate that social interaction that is irrelevant to the discussion task is significantly correlated with academic-related discussion content. Reaching a higher cognitive level of social knowledge construction (e.g., reaching agreement or applying newly constructed meaning) contributes to a successful team project. For online searching behavior, the high-performing teams exhibited systematic online searching behavior and concentrated on the task, while the low-performing teams displayed chaotic searching behavior and were distracted from the task at hand, and seemed to rarely propose their searched results or ideas in their discussions. Based on the results, several possible explanations and suggestions are proposed including the need to promote more adaptive motivation and to provide scaffolding for collaborative skills. © 2016, De La Salle University.","Springer Singapore","Asia Pac.

Namely the shift to emphasizing design (problem solving) (3), the shift to applying education, learning, and socialbehavioral sciences research, and the shift to integrating information, computational, and communications technology in education. Mills and Treagast[2] question the relative value of Problem Based or Project Based learning in the Australian context. They quote a comparison of problem-based and project-based learning at tertiary level by Perrenet et al[3]. They noted that the similarities between the two strategies are that they are both based on self-direction and collaboration, and that they both have a multidisciplinary orientation. The differences that they noted included: • Project tasks are closer to professional reality • Project work is more directed to the application of knowledge • Project-based learning is usually accompanied by subject courses (eg maths, physics etc. in engineering), whereas problem-based learning is not. • Management of time and resources by the students as well as task and role differentiation is very important in project-based learning • Self-direction is stronger in project work, compared with problem-based learning. © 2016 IEEE.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","Int.

Specifically, we use the Random Forest (RF) machine learning (ML) method to predict the effectiveness of software engineering teamwork learning based on data collected during student team project development. These data include over 100 objective and quantitative Team Activity Measures (TAM) obtained from monitoring and measuring activities of student teams during the creation of their final class project in our joint software engineering classes which ran concurrently at San Francisco State University (SFSU), Fulda University (Fulda) and Florida Atlantic University (FAU). In this paper we provide the first RF analysis results done at SFSU on our full data set covering four years of our joint SE classes. These data include 74 student teams with over 380 students, totaling over 30000 discrete data points. These data are grouped into 11 time intervals, each measuring important phases of project development during the class (e.g. early requirement gathering and design, development, testing and delivery). We briefly elaborate on the methods of data collection and describe the data itself. We then show prediction results of the RF analysis applied to this full data set. Results show that we are able to detect student teams who are bound to fail or need attention in early class time with good (about 70%) accuracy. Moreover, the variable importance analysis shows that the features (TAM measures) with high predictive power make intuitive sense, such as late delivery/late responses, time used to help each other, and surprisingly statistics on commit messages to the code repository, etc. In summary, we believe we demonstrate the viability of using ML on objective and quantitative team activity measures to predict student learning of software engineering teamwork, and point to easy-to-measure factors that can be used to guide educators and software engineering managers to implement early intervention for teams bound to fail.

In order to promote student success, highly demanded are platforms that can effectively facilitate multi-party collaboration during the development process of capstone projects. CapStone is such a platform that has been developed and deployed at the Behrend College, Pennsylvania State University. In this paper, we present the design rationale of CapStone, explaining the responsibilities of different roles involved in a capstone project and how those responsibilities are meshed into one common platform such that all parties could effectively orchestrate their activities. We have also conducted a study on how well CapStone could help student users in their project development. The responses showed that the adoption of CapStone has significantly improved student success in many ways. Particularly, over 80% of the students found CapStone helpful in project planning/scheduling, reporting weekly progress to advisors, collecting feedbacks on project works, and in writing their project reports. © 2016 IEEE.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","Proc.

Generally, these projects are part of a software engineering class and require a team effort. To facilitate team interaction, instructor monitoring, and objective performance assessment, an appropriate team environment, or set of components and services that can be combined to form an environment, must be chosen, configured, and managed. Since many of the popular team environments have subscription or per-seat licensing, educational institutions could pay significant costs to keep pace with industry. However, instructors should be able to provide a work environment with modern tools to facilitate team interaction and foster productivity while at the same time minimizing cost and reducing their configuration and management effort. In this paper, we survey a wide range of team environments and individual services for team interaction. We compare and contrast them against a set of general, user, and instructor criteria, highlighting features that are relevant to a software engineering team in an educational setting. In addition to the survey, we discuss an open source, experimental platform we are developing to allow instructors to incorporate free services and create a collaborative team environment based on the criteria they want to target. © 2016 IEEE.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","Proc.

Indeed, soft skills (such as teamwork, verbal and written communication, time management, problem solving, and flexibility) and personal attributes (such as risk tolerance, collegiality, patience, work ethic, identification of opportunity.) play a critical role in the workplace.' It also states that CS programs must 'expose students to multiple programming languages, tools, paradigms, and technologies as well as the fundamental underlying principles'. Meeting all of these curricular goals is a challenge, especially for small CS programs, where resources are limited. This paper describes a model for enabling student innovation through the use of student-led projects, across the CS curriculum, within several foundational CS courses and as part of the senior design course. To illustrate how this model incorporates emerging technologies, sample student-led Virtual Reality (VR) projects are described. Results show student-led projects promote learning and help students express creativity and innovation while developing their soft skills and personal attributes. Additionally, this approach instills a culture of creativity and innovation embraced by the CS student body, where advanced students assist newer students as they embark on their journey; and it has had a significant impact on retaining CS students. © 2016 IEEE.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","Proc.

There are distinct benefits to be gained from giving students autonomy in determining the nature and scope of the projects that they wish to undertake, but a lack of expert guidance and of a clear direction at the outset can result in confusion, frustration, and unfulfilled goals. Moreover, engineering schools face the imperative of providing students with opportunities to engage with industry during their courses, which can be difficult to accomplish due to logistical and time constraints. This paper reports on a case study in which undergraduate students of electrical, computer, mechatronics, and telecommunications engineering interacted with representatives from industry to obtain feedback at the inception phase of their design projects. Students pitched their ideas to the industry guests at a virtual 'trade fair' held within a hybrid video conferencing and three-dimensional (3-D) virtual world environment, in preparation for the assessable pitches that they had to deliver on campus to a faculty audience. Survey and assessment results attest to the participants' satisfaction as well as to the effectiveness of the approach in improving student self-efficacy and performance.

However, it needs to be redefined to engage students in higher order thinking and to facilitate effective learning. This study proposes a student-centered approach that is aligned with situated learning theory in virtual teams and explores its impact on student satisfaction and learning outcomes. Using a quasi-experimental design, 122 undergraduate and master's degree students enrolled in project management courses at two universities in separate locations. They were separated randomly into two groups, an experimental group in which students used the proposed student-centered approach and a control group in which students followed a more traditional course design. Data analysis indicated a higher level of satisfaction and performance with the proposed methodology. These results suggest that the presented methodology, which was based on project-based learning in an authentic context that offers opportunities for students to experience virtual teamwork, was more effective than traditional teaching approaches. Furthermore, there were some positive and significant correlations between students' satisfaction and their final marks. In this matter, the most relevant aspects to facilitate students' academic performance were (1) positive expectations of future professional development, (2) clear learning objectives that consistently relate to the content of the course, (3) positive feelings induced by teachers' support in resolving doubts, and (4) academic self-perception. The findings of this study suggest that motivational and affective states influence student learning in higher education.

Research questions: (1) What is the relationship between CMC anxiety and virtual team participation? (2) How does this relationship influence the perceptions of individual performance? (3) Does this relationship persist over time? Literature review: A literature review including communication and media structures, input-mediator-output team effectiveness, and individual CMC anxiety elements indicate researchable negative effects upon virtual team interaction and participation in CMC environments. Higher levels of individual CMC anxiety could dampen participation quantity, participation type (task versus social), participation quality, and perceptions of individual performance. Further, the initial negative interactions and behaviors could persist over time. Methodology: This quantitative quasiexperimental study involved surveying, observing, and coding the interactions of 22 virtual project teams (consisting of a total of 110 individuals) over a span of four months. The teams used a CMC tool with shared file space and discussion boards to coordinate database design and implementation work. Data were collected from questionnaire surveys, individual message postings, and team project scores. Individual message postings were coded to measure participation quality (task focus and topic introductions) and participation quantity (message count and words per message). Data were analyzed using repeated-measures multivariate analyses along with follow-up univariate statistical testing. Results and conclusions: The results indicate that individuals with higher levels of CMC anxiety participated less, sent fewer task-oriented messages, introduced fewer novel topics, and were rated more poorly by team members on their performance compared to individuals with lower levels of CMC anxiety. The results also show that CMC-anxious individuals do send relatively more social-oriented messages, perhaps to compensate for typical apprehensive communication behaviors in a virtual team environment. In addition, participation quality and quantity and perceptions of performance by CMC-anxious team members do not significantly improve, even with repeated interactions over CMC. Although study participants evidenced high engagement with the project tasks, the study is limited by its use of student subjects. The study suggests the importance of team leaders and role definitions for virtual teams, to counteract potential unintended effects of CMC technology use masking actual participation and contribution of virtual team members. Future research could investigate the efficacy of interventions for reducing the negative impacts of CMC anxiety in virtual team performance, as well as the influence of individual structures such as CMC anxiety in the use of CMC and team structures in the virtual team environment. © 2016 IEEE.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","IEEE Trans Prof Commun",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84984985864

One of the techniques that can be used to train them is through Problem-Based Learning (PBL) approach. The PBL implementation can be influenced by various factors depending on the ultimate goal of the study. This study is focusing on the IT students' perception of the PBL implementation. The student's perception is important to ensure the successfulness of the PBL implementation. Therefore, it is important to identify the factors that might influence the implementation of PBL of IT courses. This study aims to identify some catalyst factors that may influence the PBL implementation of IT courses. The study involved three (3) main phases: identifying PBL implementation factors, constructing a PBL model, and PBL model validation using statistical analysis. Four main factors are identified: PBL Characteristics, PBL Course Assessment, PBL Practices, and PBL Perception. Based on these four factors, a PBL model is constructed. Then, based on the proposed PBL model, four hypotheses are formulated and analyzed to validate the model. All hypotheses are significantly acceptable. The result shows that the PBL Characteristics and PBL Course Assessment factors are significantly influenced the PBL Practices and indirectly influenced the Students' Perception of the PBL Implementation for IT courses. This PBL model can assist decision makers in enhancing the PBL teaching and learning strategy for IT courses.

Therefore, a systems-level approach and systems thinking is required to understand and improve PS. The use of e-learning may help to develop a systems thinking approach in medical students, as case studies featuring audiovisual media can be used to visualize systemic relationships in organizations. The goal of this quasi-experimental study was to determine if an e-learning can be utilized to improve systems thinking, knowledge, and attitudes towards PS. Methods: A quasi-experimental, longitudinal within- subjects design was employed. Participants were 321 third-year medical students who received online surveys before and after they participated in an e-learning course on PS. Primary outcome measures where levels of systems thinking and attitudes towards PS. Secondary outcome measures were the improvement of PS specific knowledge through the e-learning course. Results: Levels of systems thinking showed significant improvement (58.72 vs. 61.27; p <.001) after the e-learning. Student's attitudes towards patient safety improved in several dimensions: After the course, students rated the influence of fatigue on safety higher (6.23 vs. 6.42, p <.01), considered patient empowerment more important (5.16 vs. 5.93, p <.001) and realized more often that human error is inevitable (5.75 vs. 5.97, p <.05). Knowledge on PS improved from 36.27 % correct answers before to 76.45 % after the e-learning (p <.001). Conclusions: Our results suggest that e-learning can be used to teach PS. Attitudes towards PS improved on several dimensions. Furthermore, we were able to demonstrate that a specifically designed e-learning program can foster the development of conceptual frameworks such as systems thinking, which facilitates the understanding of complex socio-technical systems within healthcare organisations. © 2016 The Author(s).","BioMed Central Ltd.","BMC Med.

The purpose of the current research is to better understand what teamwork problems women and minorities most frequently encounter and the resources they currently have for solving these problems. The researchers report findings from a two-part study. In Part I, 677 engineering undergraduates at three different universities responded to a survey asking to what extent they had experienced different types of team problems in their STEM classes in the past year. 85% of participants reported they had at least one problem, the most common being a ""slacker teammate."" Additionally, women were significantly more likely than men to report problems with feeling like they experienced limited learning because of their role on the team, and both women and under-represented minorities were significantly more likely than other groups to report being excluded from the main work of the team and having a domineering teammate. To complement and further illuminate the survey results, Part II describes interviews with 63 undergraduates from seven different universities, where the researchers asked participants about problems they encountered during their engineering curriculum and to comment on problem scenarios. Findings suggest that students often lack resources for effectively solving team problems, though ""high achieving"" students, defined as having a self-reported GPA of 3.5 or above, are often more proactive when dealing with slacker teammates, using strategies such as setting early deadlines or selecting teammates known also to be high achievers. However, across the board, students preferred to ""do nothing"" when dealing with domineering or exclusionary teammates. These findings shed light on the disproportionate burden women and under-represented minorities face in team projects and the lack of resources students have, pointing to a need for interventions to teach problem-solving skills. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2016.","American Society for Engineering Education","ASEE Annu.

Schools around the country are striving to prepare students for the competitive and demanding job market after college. As a way to assist students for this shift, there are in-depth discussions about the benefits of project-based learning, methods for teaching all subject-areas, and extracurricular clubs. In this paper, a detailed account of the methods and practices used in an extracurricular robotics club at a culturally diverse, low-socioeconomic Title 1 School is provided. As students collaborate within the team and compete against other schools in FIRST Robotics' FIRST TECH Challenge ® (FTC), they gain experience in problem solving, programming, fundraising, documentation, and community outreach. The aim of this paper is to evaluate the premise that Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) through robotics has an effect on minority students' confidence to pursue STEM related careers after college education. We also attempted to evaluate if the participants' attitude about learning new things changed as the students grow to become life-long learners.

This practice is believed to be beneficial for training future engineers to be more capable problem solvers. At different times and schools, the success of multi-disciplinary senior capstone teams with different approaches have produced variable results. Because design is multi-realizable, no single or simple method can be adopted for all engineering schools. For some special circumstances, or new situations, in our College of Engineering, we have now combined two courses, the Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering Senior Capstone Design (MAE 4980) and the Engineering College Senior Capstone Design (ENGR 4890) into one class, with the same instructor from Mechanical & Aerospace Engineering. Our ENGR 4890 students come from Industrial and Manufacturing Systems Engineering, from Computer Science, and from Electrical and Computer Engineering. They are all international transfer students, mostly from China, with some from India and Middle Eastern countries. Over the past 3 years (course offered twice each year), we have seen some beneficial results. We no longer need electrical and computer technicians from Engineering Technical Services. However, we still need to have a TA, or a graduate student chosen by the instructor who is good at electronics hardware and programming. We have successfully designed a few projects that are truly multi-disciplinary, for example, a 3D printer, a rotor craft UAV, and a special purpose lab furnace. We still cannot make all teams in a class multi-disciplinary, because some design topics do not have sufficient electronic content. We also encounter difficulty with insufficient enrollment of students from a specific major or skill to make an interdisciplinary design team. Several case studies illustrate our lessons learned, and plans to do more and better multidisciplinary senior capstone design projects for the future. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2016.","American Society for Engineering Education","ASEE Annu.

The course introduces project-defining skills for use in a sequence of engineering design courses taken later in the undergraduate program. ProposalBased Learning is similar to Project-Based Learning, and is comprised of the following elements: 1) requires a response to an open-ended challenge; 2) creates a need to understand the important elements of an engineering proposal, such as technical details, schedule of tasks and deliverables, and estimating costs associated with the proposed tasks; 3) requires inquiry to learn and/or create something new; 4) requires critical thinking and problem-solving; 5) requires identifying patentable aspects of the proposed solution; 6) results in a publicly presented performance; and 7) requires interpretation of customer requirements based on sparse information. This last element was given particular emphasis, as it is often overlooked in undergraduate engineering programs, yet frequently leads to unsuccessful proposal submissions due to misreading or poor internalization of customer needs. Each student group of two to five members was required to generate a unique technical proposal in response to a Request For Proposal (RFP) or Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) supplied by the instructor. The format selected for the RFP or BAA is widely used in the engineering profession. The proposal topic choices were guided by the need to: stimulate the interest of students pursuing a variety of engineering disciplines; provide deliberately vague design constraints to introduce students to the challenge of interpreting the intentions of the RFP or BAA; encourage individual creative content in the proposed solution; and adjust the technical challenge to be accessible to students with no previous engineering courses. A preliminary design review with peers and the instructor provided valuable feedback to each group, with sufficient time allotted for design changes. The learning outcomes were assessed using proposal quality, compliance with RFP or BAA specifications, judging by an outside panel of engineering and technology professionals, and student surveys. Several patentable concepts resulted from a total of 53 proposals responding to three RFP's and one BAA. The challenges of implementing the instructional framework are discussed, along with recommendations for improvements. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2016.","American Society for Engineering Education","ASEE Annu.

It begins with historical work in the area of tutorial dialogue systems. It traces the history of that area of the field of Artificial Intelligence in Education as it has made an impact on the field of Computer-Supported Collaborative Learning through the creation of forms of dynamic support for collaborative learning, and makes an argument for the importance of advances in the field of Language Technologies for this work. In particular, this support has been enabled by an integration of text mining and conversational agents to form a novel type of micro-script support for productive discussion processes. This research from the early part of the century has paved the way for emerging technologies that support discussion-based learning at scale in Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs). In the next 25 years, we expect to see this early, emerging work in MOOC contexts grow into ubiquitously available social learning approaches in free online learning environments like MOOCs, or what comes next in the online learning space. These ambitious social learning approaches include Problem Based Learning, Team Project Based Learning, and Collaborative Reflection. We expect to see the capability of drawing in and effectively supporting learners of all walks of life, especially impacting currently under-served learners. To that end, we describe the current exploratory efforts to deploy technology supported collaborative and discussion-based learning in MOOCs and offer a vision for work going forward into the next decade, where we envision learning communities and open collaborative work communities coming together as persistent technology supported and enhanced communities of practice. © 2016 International Artificial Intelligence in Education Society.","Springer New York LLC","Int.

Collaboration and team work are competencies that are sought after by many employers. The creation of effective collaboration is critical to developing the interdisciplinary linkages that are necessary to confront the many environmental challenges posed by human activities and prepare today’s students to meet future intellectual and workforce demands. To address the challenge of developing collaboration skills, the Environmental Studies (ES) program at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln (UNL) used a backward curriculum design, multiple modalities of experiential learning, and a reflective action research approach to develop collaboration and teamwork skills in undergraduate students. The ES program partnered with Target Training International Ltd. (TTI), to gain insights into the use of their instruments as boundary objects to help student’s understand self and create interdisciplinary teams. Through the use of an instrument, the TriMetrix®, the UNL-ES program is taking a page from the business world and partnering with it to help students understand themselves, adapt their behaviors to more effectively work in a team, and be introduced to the concept of assessments and their use in the professional world. These assessments played a positive role in the dynamics of each group, some more than others. The analyses of these data for this class have informed us about how to improve the use of the assessment output in class. Specifically, we can use these data as specific examples in debriefing future classes. We have also identified certain mixtures of behavioral styles and motivational drivers that may be problematic to group work. Many students have experienced team projects. However, most students have not explicitly had to learn about the factors that go into effective collaboration or they have never been explicitly explained to them. This is particularly the case with regard to processes of developing shared responsibility. © 2015, AESS.","Springer New York LLC","J. Environ. Stud. Sci.",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85006190527

Recently, the authors of this paper have developed a domain-specific modeling language approach and an associated web-based PBL application to support the development and delivery of online PBL modules in a cost-effective and flexible manner. In this paper, the authors emphasize to support peer assessment in an online PBL. Through using a peer assessment example, the authors present how to support teachers, who may not have a comprehensive technical knowledge, to specify a peer assessment process as a segment of a PBL script, a graphical representation of a PBL strategy. Then the PBL application can transform a PBL script that including the peer assessment into a formal model represented in an international e-learning technical standard IMS-Learning Design (IMS-LD). Finally, such a formal model can be executed in any IMS-LD compatible run-time environment.

The current essay details a research project conducted on problem-based learning (PBL) tutorials in the United Kingdom in which student groups were video-recorded as they worked. A discursive psychological analysis focused on instances of interaction in which a group member picked up his or her mobile phone in the middle of a working session and how the accountability for the phone use was managed by either the phone user or a fellow group member. In understanding more about the microprocesses that take place in such environments, we are better positioned to support students’ learning and socialization as they progress through college. © 2016, Interdisciplinary Journal of Problem-based Learning.

While larger teams tend to be more successful, workload is highly focused across the team, with only a few members performingmost work.We find that highly successful teams are significantly more focused than average teams of the same size, that their members have worked on more diverse sets of projects, and the members of highly successful teams are more likely to be core members or ‘leads’ of other teams. The relations between team success and size, focus and especially team experience cannot be explained by confounding factors such as team age, external contributions from non-team members, nor by group mechanisms such as social loafing.

In the fall of 2009, we started exploring how software development teams form and interact in a computer science college capstone course setting. Our initial findings were presented at ICER 2010 in Aarhus, Denmark. The focus of our research was on the experiences of computer science college course teams as compared and contrasted to the theory of Bruce Tuckman’s stages of small group development model, which he characterized as forming, storming, norming, performing, and adjourning. We continued data collection with the computer science capstone course in the fall of 2010 and added an information systems capstone course as well. At the conclusion of the spring 2014 semester, we have collected and analyzed data for a total of 5 academic years from nine cohorts of students taught by five instructors involving 215 students on 51 teams. Each year, participants repeatedly self-assessed their enthusiasm and skill levels over time using a questionnaire by agreeing or disagreeing to statements. The data shows patterns similar to that of Tuckman’s model. Since most people find Tuckman’s model easy to understand, it may provide an effective tool to teach teamwork and monitor team development. In addition to briefly presenting our empirical findings in this article, we provide a simple conceptualization of Tuckman’s model that can be captured in two data points: enthusiasm and skill level. By comparing changes in these two dimensions over time, team development can be tracked through the various Tuckman stages of small group development. We also provide a minicurriculum which can be used to introduce students to Tuckman’s model and provide them insight into what leadership style works best in each of the development stages. © 2016 ACM.","Association for Computing Machinery","ACM J.

Typically, cohesive teams tend to develop software in a more coordinated and effective way, resulting in suitable products. Although these cohesive teams could be designed to try reaching such benefits, there is no recipe that allows us to do it in a simple way. Therefore, most of the software teams are formed using any other criteria, by losing thus the potential benefits of using cohesive teams. The problem of designing these teams is not only present in the software industry, but also in the academia; particularly in capstone courses, where the students run software projects in real or simulated scenarios. In order to help find a solution to this problem, particularly for academic settings, this paper proposes a heuristic to form software development teams, considering the psycho-social profile of the students. This heuristic was used to design teams for a software engineering project course at the University of Chile, and these teams' performance was compared to those from teams designed using random allocation of student to teams. The results indicate that teams designed using the heuristic were more effective in terms of internal communication and coordination than the other teams. Moreover, the former obtained products with a quality higher than the latter. © 2015 IEEE.","IEEE Computer Society","Proc. Int. Conf. Chilean Comput. Sci. Soc.

Our panel looks at why open source is a good idea for education, and how it can best be leveraged. The panel represents industry and academia and its members have years of experience in the field. Specific questions that panelists will address, in addition to their position statements, are: What makes open source particularly attractive for educators and students? What are barriers to use? What areas of computer science and what levels of study are most appropriate for introducing open source? Finally, this panel takes a step back and looks at the broad issues associated with using that software in education. We will mention the specific details of releasing, curating, licensing and using open source software. But most of all this panel wants to explore how, for educators, open source works. We believe it is because open source fosters an ecosystem of collaborators who can pool resources and expertise to build new collaborative ways of solving hard research projects. We look forward to the contributions from the audience and energetic debate. NOTE: There are many definitions of Open source software (OSS) and Free/Open Source Software (FOSS).

Through a case-study approach, we test a developed teamwork framework, using manual content analysis and sentiment analysis, to determine if the framework can provide insight into students' teamwork behavior and to determine if the wiki task encouraged students to collaborate, share knowledge, and selfadopt teamwork roles. Analysis revealed the identification of both active and cohesive teams, disengaged students, and particular roles and behaviors that were lacking.

It is therefore important for graduates to have experienced teamwork before they enter the job market. We describe an experiential learning exercise that we designed to teach the software engineering process in conjunction with teamwork skills. The underlying teaching strategy applied in the exercise maximises risks in order to provide maximal experiential learning opportunities. The students are expected to work in fairly large, yet short-lived, instructor-assigned teams to complete software engineering tasks. After undergoing the exercise our students form self-selected teams for their capstone projects. In this article, we determine and report on the influence the teaching exercise had on the formation of teams for the capstone project. By analysing data provided by the students through regular peer reviews we gain insight into the team dynamics as well as to what extent the members contributed to the team effort. We develop and present a graphical model of a capstone project team which highlights participation of individuals during the teaching exercise. The participatory history of the members is visualised using segmented concentric rings. We consider how this visualisation can aid the identification of capstone project teams that are at risk. In our experience the composition of the team and the behaviour of other members in the team may have a marked impact on the behaviour of each individual in the team. We established a team classification in order to model information about teams. We use a statistical clustering method to classify teams. For this we use team profiles that are based on the participatory levels of its members. The team types that emerge from the clustering are used to derive migration models. When we consider migration, we build spring models to visualise the teams through which individuals migrate. We colour code the teams to characterise them according to the team types that were identified during the cluster classification of the teams. Owing to the complexity of the resulting model, only migrations for capstone team members who have worked together during the exercise or for solitary capstone team members are modelled. These models support the identification of areas of interest that warrant further investigation. To conclude, we present our observations from the analysis of team compositions, team types, and team migrations and provide directions for future work and collaborations. © 2016 ACM.","Association for Computing Machinery","ACM J.

Design/methodology/approach: An exploratory study was conducted with 41 participants in ten groups working on an in class, for-credit group project assignment utilizing a collaborative search system. Quantitative and qualitative data were gathered on the everyday search practices of students over the course of the group project, along with quality scores for the sources found. Findings: Results showed that student behavior during their CIS related to the quality of their search outcomes, as the effective and efficient searchers found better quality sources. Students’ pre-task attitudes and experiences toward group work also relate to the quality of their search outcomes. Student feedback demonstrated the importance of making collaborative search tools convenient, lightweight, and easy to use. Practical implications: These findings may be useful to researchers designing and studying the effectiveness of collaborative search tools, and to instructors planning to incorporate group projects into their classes.

The use of virtual teams to complete projects further compounds these failures. However, recent developments in intelligent virtual assistants (IVAs), such as Siri, Cortana, or Watson, have created opportunities to automate the systems-development process and improve success rates. Specifically, the use of a virtual assistant possessing key knowledge about database systems development can increase virtual team member technical proficiency in project-based skills. In addition, a virtual assistant can contribute to the development of higher-quality virtual team projects-in this case, database management systems. This observational study found that while the result of statistical analysis was not quite significant, teams that used the IVA did develop higher-quality team projects.

In particular, if we consider an university course that requires the design and the implementation of a software project, may be difficult to estimate the number of hours that a team of students has to take to accomplish that project. There is the risk to underestimate the project (too difficult) or to overestimate it (too easy) with respect to the other projects of the same course and the amount of foreseen work hours. In this paper, we present the experience we gained in the adoption of Software Project and Product Measures for addressing the project size of projects performed during a Mobile Application Development course for Computer Science students at the University of Salerno. The course foresaw a project work conducted by students organized in teams. The goal of the project work was to design and develop an Android-based application with back-end for smart devices. Software estimation project measures are applied to some metrics extracted in the requirement analysis phase to get an estimation of the effort in terms of man/hours and consequently to adjust the project size by adding/reducing requirements.

Data were collected from students and faculty through open-ended surveys and focus groups, and analyzed with qualitative data analysis techniques. The outcomes from the evaluation study indicate that the main strengths of the course were teamwork, self-directed learning, continual assessment, practical approach and faculty involvement, while the main weaknesses were the disorientation experienced by the students at the start of the problems and the uneven participation of group members in the group tasks. From our experience, we can conclude that PBL adapts well to a practical approach towards learning structures. The main shortcomings identified have been associated with poor implementation of certain key PBL principles.

However, the project activity produces a large amount of data that can be hardly assessed by a single project supervisor. This poses a scalability issue if the number of users or projects size increases. In this vein, the purpose of this paper is to make the assessment of online learning experiences more sustainable. Design/methodology/approach: This paper describes a learning-oriented collaborative assessment method, supported by an open data framework. Also, an architecture for the extraction of different indicators to facilitate the assessment process is presented. Findings: The assessment method and the open data framework were applied to a project-based course on web engineering. This experience has provided positive evidences because the grade measurement was backed up with assessment evidences and calculated with less effort. Research limitations/implications: At the moment, results indicate that apparently there are no significant evidences against the sustainable evaluation practices for students’ summative evaluation. Nevertheless, when more data become available, a more statistically significant analysis could be made to determine the influence of the assessment practices in the final result of the evaluated skills.

This approach is based on four conceptual foundations: businesslike learning environment, self-regulated learning, co-regulated learning, and formative assessment. In this approach the students develop an activity based on problem-based learning, with a specific set of tasks based on those four conceptual foundations. The approach was implemented in two courses from the second and third curricular years of the bachelor programmes in Informatics Engineering and Information & Communication Technologies. We conducted semi-structured interviews with students (n=32) at the end of the courses, to try to identify the students’ strategies for self-regulation of learning in the activity developed within the SimProgramming approach. The main strategies identified were: organization, planning, time management, identification of difficulties, resolution of the difficulties encountered, work review, identification of the factors that influenced their motivation, and structure of the environment. The factors influencing the motivation most often identified by students were the impact of the assessment in the final course grade, the completion of the course, learning, skills development, and teamwork. Generally, students applied strategies to solve the difficulties, in particular by searching for social help and information search. Procrastination was also often identified by students. Strategies of time management, transformation of information, in-depth review, self-reflection, and self-evaluation were referenced scantily. We found that students changed some of their strategies from one course edition to the next. We conclude by recommending the development of educational practices to help students review their work, treat and process the information they find, conduct self-reflection and self-evaluation of their performance during tasks, adopt concentration strategies, and become aware of their specific difficulties. © 2016, University of Minho.

The main objective is to propose and evaluate a flexible design that controls the propagation of changes in the business layer to the user interface layer in a flexible and consistent way. Many business applications that support flexibility in the business layer and also in the presentation layer fail to sustain flexibility across the boundary between the two layers. To address such problem, we introduced the presentation behaviour layer (PBL) as a solution for providing flexibility between the business layer and the presentation layer. The proposed solution addresses flexibility not only at each logical layer but also between different communicating layers. The PBL concept has been used to rebuild a real customs system.

The course has been held for two consecutive years at a University of Applied Sciences. This project-based course educates students in teamwork, user study techniques, data interpretation, and scenario-based design. Moreover, by applying usability assessment methods such as heuristic evaluations and usability tests, students learn the basics of usability engineering methods and principles. In addition to outcomes on students' learning, the course has resulted in several innovative mobile application concepts some of which are in the process of being commercialized. This paper presents student feedback about the applied methods months after the completion of the course. The questionnaire-originating results indicate that students gain knowledge and skills that are very valuable for their future careers in software and service development. Knowledge on UCD is relevant in contemporary mobile application development and an important asset for students to become competitive in job markets. Almost all students have applied the educated methods in their work, and they are willing to promote the UCD methods and framework to their professional peers. The results are further used to discuss and emphasize the importance of UCD education. Copyright © 2016 by SCITEPRESS-Science and Technology Publications, Lda.

Firstly to present a work-in-progress engineering education model O-CDIO and secondly to report the research results from recent pilot courses that have preceded the creation of the model. Research is based on and carried out as part of an extensive engineering education reform in a Nordic (Northern Europe) multidisciplinary science university (UNI), which started in 2011. The O-CDIO engineering education framework combines human-centered Design Thinking methods with Systems Thinking in a natural sciences context throughout the engineering education degree structure. The main goal of the framework is to educate engineering students to become problem definers in addition to problem solvers. O-CDIO builds on the CDIO structure adding emphasis to the first phases of the engineering cycle. O-CDIO framework has human-centered Design Thinking methods embedded in the engineering education structure throughout the curriculum, from day one to graduation. The second objective of this paper and the main research question is does adding Human-Centered Design Experiences affects the Learning of Transferable Working Life Skills? This is also one of the fundamental questions behind the O-CDIO model. Data for this study is firstly from pilot courses that were introduced to 229 students at different stages of their studies from fall semester 2012 to summer 2014, and secondly from 31 faculty members from the time line of January 2012 to June 2015. Both qualitative and quantitative analysis methods were used. Our results show that in the piloted courses tolerance towards ambiguity, engagement towards teaching methods and course structure are increased, and enhanced. Also, understanding towards Design Thinking practices, Problem Based Learning methods, understanding the role of teamwork and communication, even excelling and appreciating learning through teamwork are increased and enhanced. Further research for the O-CDIO framework will focus in the implementation requirements of the framework as well as more detailed description of the courses, their intended learning outcomes, and teaching methods. © 2016 TEMPUS Publications.","Tempus Publications","Int.

In addition to simply increasing the manpower available to solve a particular problem, team settings also leverage the variety of thinking offered by each individual. There are any number of functional behaviors that one might offer a team. This paper explores the idea that design journal records can provide key insight into the functional activities taken on by team members. The main questions asked by this study include (1) Can design journals provide consistent information about an individual's functional behavior? (2) Are individuals likely to shift behaviors over the course of the project's timeline? (3) Do individuals adapt to compensate for design behavior changes in other team members? The data in this study was collected from five volunteer teams of five to six undergraduate students each (total N = 29). At the time of their participation in the study, the volunteers we r e enrolled in the University of Maryland's mechanical engineering capstone design course, Integrated Product and Process Development. Four of the teams participated in fall 2015 and one team participated in spring 2014. Participants maintained individual journals throughout their semester-long design projects, after receiving a set of guidelines to steer but not restrict journal usage. After the projects were completed, journals were coded using a previously validated coding scheme which associates each journal entry with a design behavior class and activity. Findings for this pilot study were very encouraging. Design journals proved to be a viable source of information about the functional behaviors of individuals. The majority of the undergraduate participants in this study were found to regularly shift their focuses to different behaviors as their projects progressed. When these shifts occurred, other team members regularly shifted to accommodate the change and maintain overall similar levels of activity in each area of functional behavior for the team as a whole throughout the project's timeline.

Study I investigates the impact of multiple means of expression and action in two concurrent sections of a second-year project course. Study II compares students in the second-year project course that used verbal feedback with students in a senior capstone course that used the same verbal feedback approach. Our findings suggest that providing students with the option of giving verbal peer feedback encourages them to provide a higher percentage of critiques with elaboration versus surface critiques without elaboration. We also observed senior students to have further developed the skill of providing constructive criticism, as opposed to just criticism, both on technical and professional content. © 2016 TEMPUS Publications.","Tempus Publications","Int.

Team projects are an essential part of the software engineering curriculum. Student teams carry out full software projects, including requirements elicitation, project management, implementation, and testing. This requires various technical skills, but non-technical and psychological aspects are of utmost importance as well, just as in professional software teams. Modern software is often developed by distributed teams. In many cases, team members feel isolated and distant from each other. Indirect communication and inappropriatemedia create a similar feeling of distance as geographical location. This perceived distance could have an impact on their individual and group moods, and eventually on project success. Therefore, these factors should be considered in educational software engineering team projects. In a longitudinal study at Leibniz Universität Hannover, 20 student teams were observed over a period of 4 months. They were free to schedule team meetings when and where they wanted; and they could use any communication media they chose. Statistical correlations and non-parametric test are used for quantitative empirical analysis. Furthermore, we used analyses of variance for repeated measures to investigate conflicts over time. Results led to a number of recommendations for course organizers. They are interesting for software engineering in general. © 2015 ACM.","Association for Computing Machinery","ACM J. Trans. Comput.

EPS is a one semester student centred international programme offered by a group of European engineering schools (EPS Providers) as part of their student exchange programme portfolio. EPS is organized around a central module (the EPS project) and a set of complementary supportive modules. Project proposals refer to open multidisciplinary real world problems. Its purpose is to expose students to problems of a greater dimension and complexity than those faced throughout the degree programme as well as to put them in contact with the so-called real world, in opposition to the academic world. Students are organized in teams, grouping individuals from diverse academic backgrounds and nationalities, and each team is fully responsible for conducting its project. EPS provides an integrated framework for undertaking capstone projects, which is focused on multicultural and multidisciplinary teamwork, communication, problem-solving, creativity, leadership, entrepreneurship, ethical reasoning and global contextual analysis. The design and development of biologically inspired robots allows the students to fulfil the previously described requirements and objectives and, as a result, we recommend the adoption of these projects within the EPS project capstone module for the benefit of engineering students. © 2015 ACM.","Association for Computing Machinery","ACM Int.

Collaboration is an important instructional strategy, especially used in conjunction with PBL, and is an essential learning outcome for the twenty-first century. This study examined how collaboration can be achieved as a learning outcome and used effectively as an instructional method by understanding what causes task-, process-, and relationship-related intragroup conflict and how social skills are related to intragroup conflict and collaboration at both the individual and group levels. Literature suggests that, while task-related conflict serves as a catalyst for collaboration, process- and relationship-related conflicts are detrimental to collaboration and impede learning. Social interdependence theory suggests that social skills play an important role in enhancing collaboration and resolving conflicts. Data were collected through online questionnaires and follow-up interviews. Interview data were analyzed using a qualitative data analysis approach. The survey data were analyzed using multi-level structural equation modeling, which allowed us to reveal an interesting relationship between group-level social skills and collaboration. Results suggest that different individual difference factors triggered each type of conflict, and most of the groups experienced more than one type of conflict simultaneously. Task and process conflicts were often transformed into relationship conflict, when social skills were lacking. Interestingly, group-level social skills were more influential than individual members’ social skills in reducing intragroup conflict and enhancing collaboration. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Kluwer Academic Publishers","Instr.

To address some of the shortcomings of our previous editions, we have recently included a mastery phase to the course. While project-based learning is suitable for teaching high-level skills that require design and creativity and prepare the students for the study of software engineering, mastery-based learning is suitable for concrete skills such as basic programming tasks. Our particular innovation is to allow students into the project phase only if they have demonstrated a minimum predefined competency level in programming.

We examine regulation along a continuum, spanning from self- to co-regulation, in situations where medical students learn how to manage their own emotions and adapt their responses to patient reactions. We examine the nature of the discourse between medical students and facilitators to illustrate the conditions in which metacognitive, co-regulation and social emotional activities occur to enhance learning about how to communicate bad news to patients. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Elsevier Ltd","Comput.

In response, universities are developing courses and curricula around GSE and researchers have begun to disseminate studies of these new approaches. Problem: GSE differs from most other computer science fields, however, in that practice is inseparable from theory. As a result, educators looking to create GSE courses face a daunting task: integrating global practice into the local classroom. Aim: This study aims to ameliorate the very difficult task of teaching GSE by delineating the challenges and providing some recommendations for overcoming them. Method: To meet our aims we pose two research questions (""When teaching GSE to students in Higher Education, what are the (a) challenges, and (b) recommendations for addressing them"") and then conduct a systematic literature review (SLR) to determine the answers to these questions. Our SLR follows a carefully designed and validated protocol. Results: We found 82 papers that addressed our research questions. Our findings indicate that in addition to the challenges posed by GSE in general, particular problems arise in educational situations. The majority of these challenges fall into the ""global distance"" category, though teamwork challenges and people issues (such as trust) also commonly arise. Organizational differences between institutions, differing skill sets between students in different locations, and varying cultural work norms, for example, all operate within educational settings in quite different ways than in professional development teams. Integrating cultural training, conducting teamwork exercises to build trust, and instructor monitoring of team communication are all examples of techniques that have been used successfully by educators according to our review Conclusion: Despite the severity of the challenges in GSE education, many institutions have successfully developed courses and curricula targeting GSE. Indeed, for each of the challenges we have identified in the literature there are numerous recommendations for overcoming them. Instructors can use the recommendations given in this study as a starting point to running successful GSE courses. © 2015 ACM.","Association for Computing Machinery, Inc","ITiCSE-WGP - Proc.

A distinctive set of communication skills is needed by people who work successfully in virtual teams, and few universities or companies provide structured education and training in virtual teamwork. At a midsized southeastern Masters Comprehensive University, professors from the Colleges of Arts and Sciences, Business, and Education came together to explore how they might use cross-disciplinary student teams (groups comprised of students with different backgrounds and educational goals) to teach concepts in their own disciplines while providing students with the opportunity to become more proficient in virtual team communication. Research questions: (1) Can cross-disciplinary student team projects successfully support learning in virtual team communication as well as address the learning objectives of specific courses? (2) What can faculty learn from a cross-disciplinary teaching model that can be applied to virtual teams? Situating the case: Experiential learning is based on performing real tasks and reflecting on that process; it benefits learners by engaging them in complex, authentic situations. Virtual teams are significant because they support a great deal of the work currently taking place in our global economy; they are significant in higher education because students need to develop skills in international virtual communication before they are introduced to high-stakes work environments. In previous cases, students have collaborated across national cultures to develop project deliverables, such as websites, reports, and usability studies and present them in virtual environments using such tools as WebEx, Skype, and live streaming. How this case was studied: The findings from this case are based on individual student reflections, which were used to create a data matrix for each project, and instructor observation and evaluation. About the case: In Spring 2013, six faculty from the same university worked together to incorporate virtual teams into their classrooms. These six faculty members were divided into two groups of three with each group representing three colleges mentioned earlier. The faculty developed two interdisciplinary projects (one on infographics and another on social media) that enabled rich and diverse student collaboration. In both groups, the three faculty leaders worked together to define a project scope that students could achieve and that would relate to learning goals in each discipline. Conclusions: The lessons learned from this experience are that: (1) technical challenges will occur; (2) students from all disciplines must receive the same information; (3) instructors must balance respect for their colleagues and support for their students; (4) team assignments need to be consistent and fair; (5) instructors need to establish appropriate and fair assessment measurements for their own students; and (6) projects need to be realistic in order to show the students the value of virtual work. © 1988-2012 IEEE.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","IEEE Trans Prof Commun",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85027940668

Following the normal order in a school semester leaves students with little time to develop code and little to show for their efforts besides long written reports.

This paper describes an innovative approach in which students work on two half-projects in parallel during a semester, implementing a design developed by previous students while simultaneously developing a new design to be implemented by a following group. This approach not only starts implementation early, it also forces the students to coordinate their efforts with two different groups of students, whom they may or may not ever meet in person. That experience has not always been enjoyable, but it has demonstrated the value of quality documentation far more effectively than any lecture ever could. An added benefit is that they experience two different approaches to software engineering, and work on problems in two different domains. This novel approach to a team-based semester project is easily applied to any field in which a term project is employed, with little adjustment needed for particular subject areas. © 2014 IEEE.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","Proc.

Project-based learning can help to promote such skills in engineering programs as it allows recreating professional reality and relating fundamental theories and skills of an engineer. High-level thinking and sound judgment is developed through accumulated authentic professional experience by engineers. For engineering students a similar process can be triggered by a teaching environment which enables simulating and stimulating such skills. To prepare better professional and enhance students' employability Civil Engineering students of University of Aveiro, Portugal, have undertaken several modules on Geotechnics where a project based learning model has been used. These group projects included openended realistic scenarios tackled using different tools (spreadsheets and software). This paper refers to a module on Foundations. A collaborative project-based learning model was implemented. Students' perceptions on the added value of the project were collected using a questionnaire and are discussed. Most students had attended two modules on Soil Mechanics where a similar learning model was used, but initially they had negative reactions to it.

But on very rare occasions during their studies they should also build and test the appliances, products or machines they have planned. In this paper, the authors report on a project-oriented 'design-build-test' learning experience that accompanies lectures on Engineering Design during the third semester of a Bachelor degree programme in Mechanical Engineering. In the past academic year, students at DHBW Baden-Württemberg Cooperative State University were asked to design a winch for launching non-motorised model aeroplanes (gliders). The ground-based winch should be powered by a cordless drill. Instead of designing everything 'from the scratch', the parts for the winches should be entirely selected from a comprehensive supply parts catalogue, meeting a given budget. This allowed to go through all development phases from conception to functional testing within only six weeks without causing major capacity constraints to the faculty's laboratory. For practising communication skills, students from three different classes and two campuses were teamed up in groups. The project also involved new techniques for classroom assessment. For example, students partially got graded for easily accessible design-related parameters, like cost and assembly time. For determining the latter, the students shot an uncut digital film ('video selfie') which they uploaded on the virtual learning environment Moodle. The actual launching of the gliders will be organised outside the course in form of a competition next summer. © 2015, The Design Society. All rights reserved.","The Design Society","Proc. Int. Conf.

Sometimes, however, it can be difficult to convey its importance and application in the classroom environment. Many process and project management classes cover the core concepts, but fail to provide students with the opportunity to experience both the dynamics and leadership elements so core to project management as both a leader and a team member. This paper describes an innovative approach to using project managers (PMs) in the classroom that has had measured effects in several areas, including individual student participation, group project disposition, and in-class presentations. Results have been encouraging, with student feedback (from both PMs and group members) indicating positive effects on interest in the field and application of project management, improved group dynamics, and more individual participation in the outcome of group projects. Specifically included in the paper are examples of PM inclusion in both the class curriculum and main project from beginning to end and how they have been applied to a process and project management course in the past. Areas explored include the PM selection process, class attendance improvement via the PM-led group dynamic, PM-specific activities and evaluation, and the inclusion of a final presentation as a product in a normally process and project heavy course. For context, a description of the class curriculum, some related work, and relevant quantitative and qualitative student feedback are included as well. The concepts and examples have been successfully implemented as part of a software engineering curriculum, but they could easily be applied to any classroom that wishes to expand project management instruction beyond a simple explanation of process and project management to an immersive experience with both practical and pedagogical benefits. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2015.","American Society for Engineering Education","ASEE Annu.

In essence, the method relies on bringing software engineering student teams from senior project courses, who have accomplished some significant results in their classes, to demonstrate and showcase their projects in introductory courses in software engineering and in other STEM disciplines. Students in lower level courses, with assistance of instructor, then analyze the projects specifications, designs, and implementations, and find out about the principles and specific details of software development on a real case study, which is available at hand. Then, depending on each project's scope, an instructor in a lower level course may choose one of the techniques, such as a demo, exercise, assignment, or even experiment, to enforce learning and motivate the students to increase their chances of staying in the degree program or even switching to the software engineering program from other majors. Typical software projects involved in the first edition of FAST learning were on robotics, wireless sensor networks, microcontrollers, data acquisition and control, and others. These activities definitely engaged students in lower level courses and caused significant excitement about prospects of learning in higher level courses and pursuing careers in software engineering. © 2015 IEEE.","IEEE Computer Society","IEEE Global Eng.

Therefore, the engineering education curriculum must be adapted to accommodate change and to prepare as well as possible new engineers. To achieve this, Project-Based Learning (PBL) as an active learning methodology, assumes greater importance. PBL has been implemented for a decade (since 2004/05) in the first semester of the first and fourth year of the Master Degree in Industrial Engineering and Management (IEM) at University of Minho, Portugal, by a team of IEM teachers. This paper describes this last decade of teaching, learning and researching in a PBL environment in this degree. PBL engages students in their own learning. In IEM program, PBL also engaged teachers in improving their teaching methods by questioning continuously these. Throughout ten years, the coordination team of IEM program faced many challenges and brought significant contributions to discussion, researching on how PBL process in IEM could be improved and studying different PBL models for different students' needs. By following this path, this paper disseminates the practices researched in PBL process of IEM program and the benefits founded by applying this learning methodology through an analysis of the results of this research published in international conferences, journals and books (more than 70 publications). In light of the results achieved, as well as feedback from researchers and students, the authors believe that PBL is one of the best practices for student learning and teacher engagement.

Such abilities have been called as transversal skills [1]. Problem-based Learning (PBL) appears as a tool to meet the expectations for a more dynamic and efficient course [2]. In this work, the author shows how an experience, based on PBL principals, was used to simulate a business environment to the students of a discipline called Industrial Chemical Processes aiming at the same time promote the learning of matters related to the discipline and the acquisition of transversal skills needed to engineering professionals. The students enrolled in the course were randomly divided in twelve groups of five or six members. Each group should simulate a startup company that had as main objective to attract investment from a group of investors formed by the rest of the class. The six main issues of the discipline syllabus were distributed to the groups, so that each two groups should work on the same subject. The tasks of the groups were executed in the form of two projects, the first should address general aspects of the topic and the second should present a problem related to the theme and an innovative proposal for its solution. The teacher showed the students the rules of the course, with the schedule of presentations and how evaluations received by the class for each presentation would be converted into ""investment"" that eventually became grade for each student. Each week two groups presented their projects and competed with each other for a fictitious investment. The competitive environment served to stimulate creativity, to enhance the seriousness with which the students worked and to develop the transversal skills. At the end of the semester, students responded to a survey on the course, which showed that they were very motivated by the PBL approach; they preferred this new model to the traditional and considered to have learned as much or more than the traditional way of class.","European Society for Engineering Education (SEFI)","Proc.

For this reason, the use of Scrum in capstone (or similar) projects requiring students to work in teams is the most widely adopted strategy, described in seven studies. Four studies describe the use of simulation games as an alternative to practical project work (and even traditional lectures). Teaching Scrum through a capstone course provides a suitable environment for in-depth analyses of students' perceptions of typical Scrum practices (discussed in four studies), but also opens some pedagogical issues, such as the assessment of individual performance and consideration of students' learning styles (three studies). The remaining studies describe general experience and recommendations, the development of teaching aids and the combination of Scrum with other process models. © WIETE 2015.","World Institute for Engineering and Technology Education","Glob.

Compared to the entering first-year class, the SummerStart cohort typically has a significantly higher percentage of students who are at risk for attrition from Engineering and Computer Science. In this program in 2013, an existing engineering seminar course was transformed into a project based learning (PBL) engineering course, following previous success with curricular revision in a math course for the bridge program. The goals for the PBL course included: 1) establishing meaningful faculty-student interactions during the program, 2) introducing first-year students to real-world engineering projects and problem solving, and 3) enhancing the students' enthusiasm for engineering, effective teamwork, and attitudes towards persistence in Engineering and Computer Science.

In essence, the method relies on bringing software engineering student teams from senior project courses, who have accomplished some significant results in their classes, to demonstrate and showcase their projects in introductory courses in software engineering and in other STEM disciplines. Students in lower level courses, with assistance of instructor, then analyze the projects specifications, designs, and implementations, and find out about the principles and specific details of software development on a real case study, which is available at hand. Then, depending on each project's scope, an instructor in a lower level course may choose one of the techniques, such as a demo, exercise, assignment, or even experiment, to enforce learning and motivate the students to increase their chances of staying in the degree program or even switching to the software engineering program from other majors. Typical software projects involved in the first edition of FAST learning were on robotics, wireless sensor networks, microcontrollers, data acquisition and control, and others. These activities definitely engaged students in lower level courses and caused significant excitement about prospects of learning in higher level courses and pursuing careers in software engineering. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2015.","American Society for Engineering Education","ASEE Annu.

To address this concern, the educational program at the School of Civil Engineering of Ciudad Real in Spain was designed using a project-based learning methodology, which produced satisfactory results. Recently, to meet new requirements coming from the higher education European degrees, this program modified its curriculum. To further improve the program, the Transportation Infrastructure course, which was previously taught using traditional methods, was redesigned within a project-based learning framework and was renamed Transportation Geotechnics and Pavement Engineering. Because the school is still transitioning from the old program to the new program, a survey was conducted to compare and discuss the opinions of two groups of students who completed these subjects during the 2012-2013 academic year.

PBL provides students with the professional realities of teamwork, communication and time-management, while they are able to put in practice the technical aspects of their specialization. While the PBL literature emphasizes the complexity of projects, there is no assessment of projects in relation to complexity. Accordingly, this research proposes the use of complexity metrics as an assessment tool to evaluate design projects. Complexity metrics are evaluated in the context of process automation course projects, with definitions in three categories: (1) components and interactions metrics, (2) simultaneous components action metrics, and (3) software metrics. While existing complexity metrics from the literature are used as inspiration, adjustments and new definitions were necessary for the application and adaptation of these metrics to automated processes. Meanwhile, a focus group of former students facilitated the evaluation of the selected metrics. The lessons from this research are expected to enhance the development of better teaching strategies and at the same time motivate students to simplify the development of integrated systems. Likewise, this research is expected to influence the assessment of complexity in PBL with a list of metrics that could quantify complexity of projects in general.","Institute of Industrial Engineers","IIE Annu.

Each semester the students make one project in student groups (15 ECTS) supervised by one or two supervisors. The other 15 ECTS of the semester is split into three courses where exercises often are solved together in the students groups to enhance peer learning. From the practice in Aalborg it is know that as freshmen students working in groups often find it difficult to collaborate and to use their full learning potential from being a team. It seems obvious that teambuilding and help to develop team work competences could be very useful for the new teams. This was documented by Professor Kolmos in 1999 [1]. To improve the potential of project work a special course is offered to help the students develop their skills in cooperation, learning and project management (CLP). This course has proven very helpful for most of the engineering students but students from some educations are more reluctant to follow the course and do the exercises than other. Students studying Bachelor in IT (BAIT) has for two years showed less interest in the course than e.g. Software and Computer Science students. The consequences of this are that some BAIT students don?t develop their team work skills and competences to the level that is expected. This has been identified by comparing process analysis that each student group has to write after the first semester to reflect on their skills in team work and come up with ideas to improve their performance in the next project. Each lesson in the CLP course is approximately 50% lecturing and 50% exercises. It was decided to try and activate the students more in the autumn 2014 and to follow up on some of the key exercises. The implementation involved student groups handling in written answers to exercises from two key lessons on group contract and time planning. Then the lecturer visited each group 2 weeks later to discuss the exercises and the lessons learnt by applying the methods in the daily project work. The effect of the changes in the course is analyzed by comparing both the written Process Analysis and individual answers from the students to relevant exam questions taken from a written exam of the course. The results show significantly improvements in the quality of the Process Analysis and the development of the student?s team work competencies. Only 3% failed the course exam compared to 19% the year before.","European Society for Engineering Education (SEFI)","Proc. SEFI Annu. Conf. - Divers. Eng. Educ.: Oppor.

One pedagogical activity used to promote global competencies is the participation of students in multinational design projects. This is a problem-based learning approach in an international setting, where students get immersed in the solution of anengineering design task while they work in teams and collaborate with international partners. The main goal of these projects is to foster international collaboration and to offer an opportunity to the students to develop professional skills through international teamwork effort in the solution of a design problem. However, a real challenge of this practice has been to create an effective interaction among the students participating in this type of projects and to maintain the flow of information, and student engagement in the project and in their learning. The main objective of this work is to investigate the sociotechnical interaction of engineering students working in a multinational collaborative project and the role of information technology tools and the nature of the interaction in this experience. For this purpose an assessment tool was developed and used to determine the interaction among the students (frequency, quantity and quality), the value of social interaction in the flow of the interaction, and the impact of the interaction in the development of the project.

The senior design course of the IMSE programme at KU is unique and effective. In particular, at the stage of problem identification, students identify problems as opposed to the common practice of faculty members identifying them. In this article, four questions are addressed; how an organisation is selected, how a problem is identified, how the senior design course outcomes map to the ABET student outcomes and how a project is evaluated. The answers to the four questions are provided as a result of the author's experience of teaching the senior design course in the IMSE programme for more than a decade.

Universities vary in how they implement the instruction and implementation of the design process in their capstone courses. For example, many have a separate class in design methods, followed by a one-semester capstone course where teams work on a ""design, build, test"" project. Other institutions teach design methodology incorporated into the capstone design project in what is often a two-semester capstone sequence. In the cases where design methodology is incorporated into a two-semester capstone course, it is possible that this is the students' first extensive exposure to design methods and process. In that case, students may be experiencing methods such as ""Customer Needs Analysis"", ""Functional Decomposition"", ""Concept Generation"", ""Concept Selection"" and ""Prototype Planning"" for the first time. From a constructivist educational standpoint, it can be problematic for students to apply these design techniques for the first time on what is often a complex, real world capstone design problem. One solution to this problem is to incorporate a short design experience at the beginning of the two-semester capstone course. This can allow the students an initial experience with the design methods that can provide a ""learning scaffold"" for their implementation of the full suite of design methods over the course of a two-semester project. For the last three years, we have implemented three versions of a short, introductory design project (i.e. designette) in our two-semester capstone design sequence. In our uses of the designette project, the suite of five core design methods mentioned above were taught in an abbreviated form. However, in one year the designette lasted ten class hours, the next year's designette lasted 14 class hours, and this past year's project lasted seven class hours. The longest designette allowed for greater depth in the initial coverage of the methods and also provided greater time for prototyping and testing. Of course this was at the cost of consuming a greater percentage of the overall time allocated for the actual capstone design project. This paper reports on the implementation details of the designette projects, focusing in particular on advantages and disadvantages of the different implementations in the most recent years. Faculty and student feedback indicated that the use of the designette does increase student familiarity with the design methods. However, more subtle questions such as the number of lessons allocated for the designette and the depth of coverage of the design methods have much more complicated assessment results. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2015.","American Society for Engineering Education","ASEE Annu.

Differing definitions and lack of empirical evidence make it difficult to help students develop these skills. Purpose: This research seeks to understand what it means to have professional skills in an industrially situated capstone project and, by extension, in engineering. We also aim to demonstrate the influence on those skills of the feedback provided to students. Design/Method: Our ethnographic study employs discourse analysis to focus on professional skills. Using the construct of communities of practice, we describe and analyze conversations between a coach and four student teams as the coach provided feedback, and conversations among students as they worked in teams. Results: Approximately half the discussion addressed the following professional skills: communication, documentation, teamwork, the economic impact of engineering solutions, and project management. Development of professional skills promotes students' enculturation into both a disciplinary community (chemical engineering) and an industrial community (semiconductor industry). Feedback on professional skills generally was given in the context of technical aspects, and we found an interplay between the teams' participation in professional skills activities and participation in more technical activities. Conclusions: Participation in engineering design projects provides students opportunities to practice both professional and technical skills. Feedback on professional skills helps students recognize how to simultaneously represent themselves as legitimate members of multiple communities of practice. © 2015 ASEE.","Wiley-Blackwell Publishing Ltd","J.

However, most methods associated with IWF use a simple average algorithm which still has limitations in effectively reflecting abnormal situations. Therefore, this study proposes an iterative method for measuring a fair IWF by considering each assessor's reliability. The proposed algorithm considers each assessor's reliability which is evaluated by an analysis of variance of the scores given by the assessor. This relative reliability factor is used to improve the fairness of the IWF and reduce the effect of unfair or unreliable assessors' scores. A comparison with previous methods demonstrates that the proposed method resulted in substantially more fair grades being given to individual students for group projects. © 2013 © 2013 Taylor & Francis.",,"Teach.

The differences between Open Learning Environments and formal learning settings, in particular with respect to scale and the amount and types of data available on the learners, suggest the development of automated services for the initiation of project-based learning and team formation. Based on current theory on project-based learning and team formation, a team formation process model is presented for the initiation of projects and team formation. The data it uses is classified into the categories ""knowledge"", ""personality"" and ""preferences"". By varying the required levels of inter-member fit on knowledge and personality, the team formation process can favour different teamwork outcomes, such as facilitating learning, creative problem solving or enhancing productivity. The approach receives support from a field survey. The survey also revealed that in every-day teaching practice in project-based learning settings team formation theory is little used and that project team formation is often left to learner self-selection. Furthermore, it shows that the data classification we present is valued differently in literature than in daily practice. The opportunity to favour different team outcomes is highly appreciated, in particular with respect to facilitating learning. The conclusions demonstrate that overall support is gained for the suggested approach to project-based learning and team formation and the development of a concomitant automated service. © J.UCS.",,"J.

With the increasing complexity of ship systems and the modern maritime environment, it is vital that maritime professionals be educated to the highest standards of teamwork and leadership, rather than focusing exclusively on their training as entry-level mates, engineers and shoreside professionals. While all maritime universities have elements of leadership in their student development, few have fully developed leadership programs within their academic coursework. This paper proposes a set of leadership approaches and techniques that can be employed in the classroom environment and argues that many leadership techniques and strategies can easily be embedded in existing major-specific coursework, and not just courses specifically dedicated to leadership. The techniques and approaches addressed were developed in two courses in the Global Studies and Maritime Affairs major. The key unit of analysis was student project teams, specifically, ""leaderless"" teams. While the expected salutary effects of the techniques and approaches used were not initially realized, they did demonstrate significant remedial benefits. The findings suggest that adequate development of the leadership capacities and skills discussed cannot be achieved in a single course.

In PBL-scenarios situated in distributed environments, most of a group's work-processes are mediated through the use of production-focused tools that are unconcerned with the important informal and social aspects of a project. On the other hand, there are plenty of tools and platforms that focus on doing the opposite and mainly support informal bonding (e.g., Facebook), but these types of environments can be obtrusive and contain distractions that can be detrimental to a group's productivity and are thus often excluded from working environments. The aim of this paper is to examine how a game-based multi-user environment (MUVE) can be designed to support project-based learning by bridging the gap between productivity-focused and social software. To explore this, the authors developed a game-based MUVE which was evaluated in a PBL-scenario.

This paper presents a model of team dynamics adapted to the specificities of SE project teams. The taxonomy is composed of nine episodes that are likely to be found in any software team process. Each episode is described in terms of the input-process-output cycle and illustrated with examples. The measurability of the episodes is validated on a capstone student project carried out with an industrial partner. The team activities are recorded by each developer, throughout the project's duration, in the form of work tokens. These work tokens are then associated with episodes by two independent coders. The results show that all the episodes of the proposed taxonomy are measurable, and very few (less than 5% in this field study) remain ambiguous. Most of the ambiguities arise from short episodes that alternate during team process activities. This paper's contribution to software team process research is to synthesize the team literature and draw up a theoretically driven taxonomy of team dynamics specific to SE teams and to provide initial evidence of measurability of the taxonomy.

We propose visualizations, metrics and algorithms to provide an insight into practices and procedures followed during various phases of a software development life-cycle. The proposed visualizations and metrics (learning analytics) provide a multi-faceted view to the instructor serving as a feedback tool on development process and quality by students. We mine the event logs produced by software repositories and derive insights such as degree of individual contributions in a team, quality of commit messages, intensity and consistency of commit activities, bug fixing process trend and quality, component and developer entropy, process compliance and verification.

However, peer-to-peer interaction often suffers barriers owing to a failure to explore useful social interaction information in web-based cooperative learning environments. This easily leads to learners being unable to seek appropriate learning partners for facilitating effective cooperative learning. This problem frequently causes poor learning effectiveness in web-based cooperative learning environments. Generally, instructor assigned or learner selected learning peers cannot ensure to compose suitable learning partners for individual learners in cooperative learning environments. A suitable learning partner can help the learner, who is learning in the personal way and encounters the difficulty, to solve problems. Inappropriate learning partners cannot only easily lead to poor learning interaction and achievement, but can also lead to the meaning of cooperative learning being lost. Although many web-based learning systems have already been developed to assist cooperative learning, supporting peer-to-peer interaction in computer-supported cooperative learning (CSCL) is still immature. As a result, this study presents a novel scheme for recommending appropriate learning partners for individual learners utilizing mining of learning interactive social networks in a cooperative problem-based learning (PBL) environment. Results of this study show that the proposed scheme helps encourage learners to interact with learning peers more actively and positively, and facilitates learning performance in a cooperative PBL environment. © 2013 © 2013 Taylor & Francis.",,"Interact.

There is very little disagreement about its importance for the engineers. The key question has been how? How to implement theory into practice both in the curriculum and in the actual learning enhancement phase? Both Problem-based learning [2] and CDIO framework [1] are constructivist learning approaches [3] that emphasize these issues. In this paper, we discuss and elaborate some of the learning results of two interdisciplinary masteŕs level student teams that were structurally organized as Capstone project courses [4]. The course projects had ill-defined and openended problem setting. The coaching for students was organized from the departments of Information Technology and Nursing Science at University of Turku. Students that participated in the project represented 3 higher education institutions and 8 disciplines. The disciplines were nursing science, engineering, sustainable development, computer science, social science, educational science, business and administration as well as futures studies. Altogether there were fifteen (15) students from two (2) different nationalities in this study. The results show that in a teamwork and problem oriented and project based setting [5] the learning of professional skills of the students can be enhanced both at the team and the individual level. Interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary learning happens inside the teams and it depends on the time used, structure of the facilitation process and the general team dynamics.

However, we do not yet have an established method to determine the optimal team composition to achieve maximum educational effectiveness. In this study, we quantitatively and qualitatively investigate how personal characteristics and the learning process of team members affect educational effectiveness by examining a university course in which students work in teams on a realistic project in a classroom setting. We use the Five Factors and Stress (FFS) theory and the modified grounded theory approach (M-GTA) to measure the personal characteristics and to identify the learning process of each team member. Additionally, we compare the learning process of a team with a high educational effectiveness to one with a low educational effectiveness based on number of topics about the learning process and the kind of topics. As a result, we find that it is better for a team to have members with different personal characteristic as defined by FFS theory in order for the students to acquire more knowledge and skills through the course. Additionally, teams that focus on fewer learning process topics acquire more knowledge and skills. We expect that our findings will help increase the educational effectiveness in similar practical courses. © 2014 IEEE.","IEEE Computer Society","IEEE Conf. Softw. Eng. Educ.

An effective strategy to teach agile practices is the use of a capstone project, in which students develop requirements following an agile methodology. To improve students' learning experience, professors have to keep track and analyze the information generated by the students during the capstone project development. The problem here arises from the large amount of information generated in the learning process, which hinders professors to meet each student's learning profile. Particularly, to know the students skills and preferences are key aspects on a learner-centered approach of education in order to personalize the teaching. In this work, we aim to discover the relationships between students' performance along a Scrum-based capstone project and their learning style according to the Felder-Silverman model, towards a first step to build the profiles. To address this issue, we mined association rules from the interaction of 33 Software Engineering students with Virtual Scrum, a tool that supports the development of the capstone project in the course.

Within the structure of an engineer's academic education, design projects are applied as a medium to help develop professional, methodological and social competencies. At the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT) yearly events for undergraduate students (third and fourth semester) of mechanical engineering are organized, during which several hundred students are grouped into small project teams and work together to solve a common design task. During this design project, the students' progress in competence development is monitored in a total of six project milestones, the so-called workshops. In order to provide specific and purposeful feedback on the status quo of competency development, a five-dimensional competence model is used. The five dimensions are professional competence, methodological competence, creativity, teamwork abilities and strength of implementation. In this work a federal funded project with the aim of evaluating learning outcomes especially of soft skills in a reliable and valid manner is presented. Since the past two years of the research project several empirical investigations were made and led to specific tools which are currently under testing in the workshops.

Project managers are expected to understand the relations, roles and responsibilities in this collaborative working environment. Construction project managers need to be equipped with skills to process and understand the principles of interdisciplinary working. In order to keep pace with industry requirements, it is necessary for universities to teach subjects in tertiary education courses that educate and motivate construction students towards interdisciplinary working. This paper is based on a research project aimed at understanding opportunities and challenges for introducing subjects that require students from different disciplines to work together on an integrated project. In order to teach interdisciplinary working principles to project management students, a new post-graduate subject, Integrated Project Delivery, was introduced in the Master of Project Management at the University of Technology Sydney (UTS) as part of a construction sub-major. The subject was designed and teaching materials prepared based on inputs from architecture, engineering and construction management academics. In the teaching of the subject, interdisciplinary student teams were formed based on educational background and professional experience. An (pedagogical) action research approach was adopted to study the challenges and benefits of new ways of learning in line with the UTS learning strategies being adopted by academics. The main finding of this research concluded that project-based learning is very valuable to both students and industry alike as it promotes working on a live project enthusiastically and gaining industry experience in new ways of working adopted by industry. Working in multi-disciplinary teams requires students to respect the other team participants from different backgrounds, inculcating values of team spirit and discouraging adversarial behaviours. Furthermore this research provides insights about student expectations from a post-graduate subject and their experience of a multi-disciplinary working environment. This paper discusses both the successes and the issues faced during the teaching of this subject and suggest future directions for research and effective approaches to implementing interdisciplinary working in an educational environment.","University of Technology Sydney","Int.

One of the general aims of incorporating literature in an ESL classroom is to enhance students' proficiency and enjoyment of the English language through literature. One of the biggest challenges in the ESL classroom is making learning meaningful, and project-based learning is but one of many ways to achieve this goal. The main focus of the Literature component in the Malaysian English curriculum is to fulfil academic requirements, but this does not preclude students' enjoyment of the texts or the experience of engaging with literary texts. Literary texts are wonderful materials that can be explored and exploited in the ESL classroom, for instance, for the development of writing skills. This study is based on the precepts of Project-Based Learning, which hinges on Constructivist ideals looking towards long-term student centred, activity-based learning framed by sequential acquisition of discrete skills through holistic and realistic learning. This study will be exploring the acquisition of skills and language as part of holistic learning through the staging of a play. The most pertinent findings are that PBL as it is applied here allowed the students to focus on the impending stage production as both an outcome and a motivation to acquire skills. It found that as the curriculum requirements of reading, writing, listening and speaking were no longer abstract personal choices but rather skills the students were acquiring in the pursuit of completing the project, the students significantly improved in their commitment to acquiring and in the practice of language skills and holistic values such as self-confidence, team work and perseverance. The findings were most eloquently supported in the students' own words in their journals as they tracked their progress and setbacks from the beginning of the year until the end of the project and the release of the results of their final exams. As writing is a difficult skill to master, this study supports both the concept of language acquisition in practice as well as fulfilling the school-based assessment skill building requirement in a cohesive construct that provides focus and reward for the students as well as breaks the monotony of conventional classroom teaching. At the very least, it offers teachers some of the possible strategies or activities using literary texts used in schools to develop English communication in the four areas, with special focus on writing skills. It also examines the students' learning process in producing pieces of writing in response to reading a literary text, their response to performing as a post-writing activity, and the implications of using drama and plays as a post-writing activity. The ready-made year-end school performance for teachers provided in this paper is also a bonus. © Universiti Putra Malaysia Press","Universiti Putra Malaysia","Pertanika J. Soc. Sci.

One challenge that programs face is providing appropriate technical and professional feedback to students on their capstone projects. For example, students may be working in an application domain in which the faculty member has limited knowledge, or may be using newer technologies that the faculty member has not used before. To overcome these problems, it is often advantageous for the team to partner with an industrial mentor. The industrial mentor can provide technical assistance to the project as well as provide impartial and unbiased feedback on the status of the project. However, this is not always feasible, as not all campuses are located in urban areas, and project stakeholders may not be local to the institution. This work in progress article describes the first part of a two part project to overcome some of these problems. In this portion of the project, capstone teams work directly with an alumnus who serves as ""External Industrial Reviewer"" on the project using remote video conferencing. As the students complete significant milestones, deliverables are critiqued by External Industrial Reviewer who is impartial to the project. Students receive feedback on the deliverable, which can then be incorporated into future projects. This article describes the concept as well as provides a preliminary assessment of the technique. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2013.","American Society for Engineering Education","ASEE Annu.

Assigning grades to individuals for a group project is important because instructors want to assign grades that reflect effort as well as content. Since all students in a group typically receive the same grade for a group assignment, group grades have the undesirable effect of obscuring a student's true performance. Thus, it is desirable to develop a method which could be used to more accurately reflect the true contribution of each student within a group. The authors tried using several methods to determine the distribution of effort within the teams including merit pay (a form of extra credit based on peer evaluations), team journals (where teams self report the distribution of effort), and computerized team evaluations (e.g. CATME, which won the 2009 Engineering Pathways Premier Software award). All of these methods can be used by the instructor to redistribute the group grade based on individual effort. In this paper, an automated method of adjusting the group grade is proposed and tested. A key assumption was that a team consisting of members, whom all received C's on their individual assignments, would earn a low grade on their group work when compared to a team consisting entirely of A students (as measured by their individual grades). This assumption is based on the fact that the group work in most classes requires that the students display a mastery of the skills learned from the assignments completed as an individual. Based on this assumption, a new method was developed to adjust grades within each group based on the residual of the individual grades within the group and the portion of the course grade defined by group work. The method was tested on about 2500 student grades from a first-year engineering course. The key assumption was tested and verified. It was found that the automated grade adjustment method agreed about 80% of the time with the manual grade changes made by the instructors at the end of semester (based on journals, CATME, etc.). The grade adjustment method has strong potential as an automated tool to give the instructor a non-behavioral glimpse at team performance. It is recommended that the adjustment method only be used for flagging dysfunctional teams and not for the actual computation of a student's course grade for several reasons. First, the method is difficult to explain to students. Secondly, students would not be able to calculate their grade without knowing the grades of their teammates (a violation of FERPA laws). Lastly, students already dislike having their grade dependent on the performance of their teammates and the proposed grading scheme would lead to a competitive rather than collaborative team environment. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2014.","American Society for Engineering Education","ASEE Annu.

The University of Michigan's College of Engineering was awarded part of a United States Agency for International Development grant to improve higher education in Liberia, namely the Excellence in Higher Education for Liberian Development program. Specifically, the University of Michigan's role in this grant is to increase the capacity of and enthusiasm among young students toward the two most crucial fields in the future of the country: engineering and agriculture. To accomplish this, the University of Michigan developed co-curricular programs at the secondary and university level that (i) create a pipeline of higher educational opportunities for students committed to pursuing careers in engineering and agriculture and (ii) increase the field-specific practical skills and breadth of experiences of those students. A specific focus of these co-curricular programs is on the development of soft skills of the participants - which are key for their future professional success. Already, within the first two years of implementation of these programs, unique and positive results have been demonstrated by the participants. The enthusiasm and commitment of the students toward engineering and agriculture has markedly increased. Furthermore, students have developed and improved their soft skills, such as public speaking, presentation skills, group work, communication skills, study skills, goal development, and critical thinking.

PLP helps students link computer engineering concepts-logic design, microprocessors, computer architecture, embedded systems, compilers, operating systems, and high-level language constructs-in order to be able to construct a deeper understanding of the field of computer engineering. This deeper/richer understanding is expected to improve their knowledge retention, and their ability to assimilate new knowledge when they enter the workforce. PLP is based on the theoretical framework of conceptual blending-how human beings synthesize new knowledge by assimilating and blending what they already know. Since some aspects of this framework are similar to constructivism, PLP-based courses utilize project-based learning, collaborative learning, and an emphasis on students being able to articulate design decisions. To test the effectiveness of PLP, pre/post content tests in a number of courses served as quantitative data while qualitative results were obtained from linguistic analysis of student reflective essays and video transcript of students from lab sessions, and through focus group interviews. The qualitative methods allowed us to stand in the students' shoes and provided deep insights into how they acquired procedural and conceptual knowledge. Our results show that students viewed PLP-based course projects as authentic tasks representative of real engineering projects. The results also showed that the PLP environment served to push students to go back and review concepts from current and previous courses that they would need to apply in their projects. The project has produced a number of products including tutorials for instructors and students, research papers, PLPTool Java code, the PLP instruction set, and the PLP reference implementation in Verilog. All these are available on the PLP website to facilitate easy adoption of PLP at other universities. We are looking for partners to adopt PLP in their courses. The long-term vision for PLP is to be a free and scalable platform for face-to-face and online education in computing worldwide. We are at the initial stage, where our platform is mature and tested at our own sites, but has not been adopted at other institutions. Expected future direction for PLP includes three lines. Visualization tools that use PLP as the underlying engine aim to allow students at all levels (middle-school through practicing professionals) to understand how computers work. We are also working on creating literature, website materials, and tutorials to facilitate PLP's adoption by other instructors. This work will help in the third line of exploration- research on impact of PLP on student learning. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2014.","American Society for Engineering Education","ASEE Annu.

These new trends and the need of educating world-class engineers with global competencies have opened opportunities for new educational models to expose students to international experiences to start developing those capabilities. One pedagogical activity used to promote global competencies is the participation of students in multinational design projects, which is a problem-based learning approach in an international setting, where students get immersed in the solution of an engineering design task while they work in teams and collaborate with international partners. Consequently, a collaborative network of institutions from the Americas and Italy has developed and executed collaborative multinational design projects as part of academic experiences for their students. The main goal of these projects is to foster international collaboration and to offer an opportunity to the students to develop professional skills through international teamwork effort in the solution of a design problem. However, a real challenge of this practice has been to create an effective interaction among the students participating in this type of projects and to maintain the flow of information, and student engagement in the project and in their learning. Therefore, this paper reports the work related to an assessment approach used to monitor students' interaction in multinational collaborative projects.

Due to the ERP system implementations being managed via the group, project team cohesion is often involved in the process of ERP group implementation (Wang et al., 2006). In this study, the researcher attempted to evaluate the effects of team members' centrifugal and centripetal forces (CCFs) in regard to ERP implementation performance and project team cohesion, which affects the CCFs and successful ERP implementation. The results were investigated from a survey of 305 respondents that was collected from the members of ERP groups in small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in Taiwan. In addition to the centripetal forces being signi.cantly positively related to ERP implementation performance and centrifugal forces not being signi.cantly related to ERP implementation performance, the researcher also found that cohesion moderated the relationships between the CCFs and ERP implementation performance. Moreover, high centrifugal forces through cohesion lead to more successful ERP implementation when there are high centripetal forces than do low centrifugal forces through cohesion. However, the low centrifugal forces through cohesion lead to more successful ERP implementation performance when there are low centripetal forces than do high centrifugal forces through cohesion. In this study, we suggested that enterprises should use cohesion effectively to improve ERP implementation performance. © 2014, Elsevier B.V.

Problembased instruction is a learning methodology that learners acquire knowledge and critical thinking skills from solving problems within a cooperative framework. In this study, problem-based instruction has applied to on-off blended (collaboration) English course designed to improve students' listening and communication skills. The subjects are 150 university students who take blended English classes as an elective course. The classes were done by problem based instruction plans. For the finding of students' academic achievement, students' complex and irregular problem solving abilities were evaluated twice a month according to the syllabus and class activities. The data were analyzed by SPSSWIN(ver10) after conducting data analysis. It showed the means of general academic achievement of problem based instruction classes including online class, cooperative activities, and correlation among those three factors. The result of this study shows that students are generally satisfied with the classes applying to problem-based instruction. In the online problem based learning, cooperative group work enables students to better organize their thought processes and ideas than those in off line. Finally, it is important to conclude that blended problem-based instruction stimulates students to judge and solve the given unstructured problems and is effective for students' positive learning attitude and academic achievement. © Research India Publications.","Research India Publications","Int.

This gap is in part created by the fact that school-age children in the US show less interest in STEM subjects. Engineering-based approaches have been shown to improve student motivation for STEM subjects, but there is a need for a structured teaching methodology to make engineering-based pedagogy implementable in high school level education. This paper introduces a new teaching model, dubbed Engineering-Based Learning (EBL), to allow both teachers and students to follow a structured approach to teaching and learningSTEMsubjects in high schools. The building blocks of theEBLmodel are the engineering design process, computer-aided design, and capstone design experience, which is typically required in an ABET-accredited college engineering curriculum. EBLhas been implemented and tested over a three-year research project in urban high schools, including but not limited to Boston Public Schools serving students from diverse backgrounds. The project has developed an effective two-week summer professional development program, called CAPSULE, to train teachers in EBL methodology. Teachers, who are trained in this program, have implemented EBL in their STEM classes. The project trained 82 high schoolSTEMteachers (grades 9-12) from 45 school districts, and 62 distinct high schools. Over a period of three years, more than 4500 students have been taught by teachers trained in the engineering-based learning program. The results of student surveys and teachers' feedback reveal several observations: EBL is an effective new methodology for high schoolSTEMteaching; EBL can help students learn, absorb, and retainSTEMtopics and concepts; there is a positive change in how students perceive STEM subjects and careers; and EBL is a bridge that can address the disconnect between theory and application in STEM classes. © 2014 TEMPUS Publications.","Tempus Publications","Int.

In order to ensure that graduating students are equipped with innovation skills to meet this challenge, we must ensure that engineering curricula are enhancing students' innovation capabilities. In this paper we investigate if the undergraduate engineering curriculum can have a significant positive effect on students' innovation capabilities. In addition, we investigate if individual difference factors, such as engineering design selfefficacy and self-reported GPA, can be correlated with innovation capabilities. To test this, we assessed students' solutions to specific open ended problems for their level of innovation, or more specifically, originality and technical feasibility. The experiments were replicated at two universities and with a variety of cohorts, including freshman students before and after an introductory engineering course and senior mechanical engineering students before and after a capstone course. We found that that students' innovation capabilities were enhanced by the senior-level capstone course at both universities. Similar positive results can be found for the overall four year curriculum at both schools. While individual differences in academic performance and engineering design self-efficacy did not predict seniors' performance, these individual difference factors did interact to influence originality in the freshmen students. At high levels of GPA, increased selfefficacy led to increased originality, but at low levels of GPA, increased self-efficacy led to lower originality scores. Results are discussed in relation to prior research and suggestions are made to track freshmen students to better train future engineers.

These experiences should integrate theoretical knowledge with practical skills in order to enhance employability skills and prepare students for the industry. A common practice in order to achieve this goal is having students work in groups in Software Engineering Capstone projects. Despite the numerous benefits, however, capstone projects impose a number of challenges for educators. One of them is the fair assessment of students within a group. This paper presents an assessment scheme that takes into consideration both the individual effort that a student places in a groupwork capstone project, as well as, the value of the effort as perceived by teammates via peer assessment. The assessment scheme and the utilized peer assessment form are validated through questionnaires. Students' perceptions concerning their experiences in past projects as well as their opinions about the specific assessment scheme are gathered and analyzed. The results are encouraging and provide an indication that the proposed assessment method which integrates peer assessment promotes a more fair assessment for Software Engineering Capstone projects.

As software engineering requires not only technical, but also inter- and intrapersonal skills, these skills should also be assessed. Assessing soft skills is challenging, especially when project-based and experiential learning are the primary pedagogical approaches. Previous work suggests that including students in the assessment process can yield a more complete picture of student performance. This paper presents experiences with developing and using a peer assessment framework that provides a 360-degree view on students' project performance. Our framework has been explicitly constructed to accommodate and evaluate tacit skills that are relevant in agile software development. The framework has been evaluated with 18 bachelors- and 11 masters-level capstone projects, totaling 176 students working in self-organized teams. We found that the framework eases teacher workload and allows a more thorough assessment of students' skills. We suggest including self- and peer assessment into software capstone projects alongside other, more traditional schemes like productivity metrics, and discuss challenges and opportunities in defining learning goals for tacit and social skills. © 2013 IEEE.",,"Proc.

The course design enables the creation of a simulated industrial context, the benefits of which go well beyond the usual, well-documented benefits of group project work. In order to deliver a successful outcome, students must combine academic theory and practical knowledge whilst overcoming the day-to-day challenges that face project teams.

The school of engineering at University C has been using technology to deliver content to students, which include the use of audio recordings of lectures, screen capture of lectures using Camtasia and video recordings of the lectures. The students when inquired about these technology enabled practices, supported the practices and recommended the use of video recorded lectures along with the screen capture using Camtasia as a preferred method to deliver the content as it allowed them more interaction with the lectures. The case studies give an insight in the diverse and challenging nature of engineering research and their impact on the student and staff experience. Copyright © 2013 Authors' names.",,"Res. Eng.

Traditional project risks, such as complexity, the uncertainty of factors influencing the project, and the high interdependency of project tasks must be managed alongside changed temporal, geographic, and cultural dimensions. Only a few studies have investigated the effect of critical technological issues, such as wrong tool selection or limited internet access on performance as well as team and team member satisfaction in virtual work settings. Research questions: How do critical technology-related issues concerning the selection and use of web-based tools influence the performance and satisfaction of virtual project teams? Literature review: Instead of categorizing virtual teams as a type of team that contrasts with traditional or face-to-face teams, the focus has shifted to virtualness as a characteristic present in all teams. Project teamwork is often integrated in university degree programs in order to prepare students appropriately for real-life projects. While these student teams are often not geographically spread across countries, they have a high degree of virtualness because of their diverse team composition, the necessity for working at different places, and the limited face-to-face meeting opportunities. Performance, effectiveness, and satisfaction are central issues in the evaluation and measurement of project teams: Team performance is often evaluated on the basis of acceptance of a specified output by a customer. Through specific mediating processes, team performance can alternatively be assessed by inquiring the team's perception on their performance. Effectiveness can be defined as the achievement of clear goals and objectives and it is often related to the team's performance. Finally, satisfaction can be defined as having three dimensions - satisfaction with the team, the satisfaction of meeting customer needs, and general satisfaction with extrinsic rewards and work. Technology use is substantial for distributed teamwork and can be assessed by the extent to which it supports communication, collaboration, and project-management tasks. Methodology: Fifteen teams were observed and interviewed over a two-year period. The resulting data were analyzed using a Grounded Theory approach, which revealed how the selection and use of tools for communication, collaboration, and project management in the different project activities influenced the team's performance. Results and conclusions: Our results contribute to practice by providing a number of guidelines for the management of virtual teams as well as knowledge required by companies wishing to launch projects with virtual teams. Differing performances of teams can, in many cases, be attributed to such conditions as: internet availability and bandwidth; lack of training for certain tools; the selection and appropriate use of tools; integrated tool support for task management; as well as the promotion of transparency about progress made. It was found that restrictions in internet access of even a single member within a team limited the team's technological choices, which affected the team's performance. © 1988-2012 IEEE.",,"IEEE Trans Prof Commun",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84890094748

We developed the infrastructure to capture these notes using the MediaWiki platform, an easy to use wiki environment.

SPA generally has not been rigorously tested, so medical educators have limited evidence about SPA effectiveness. Methods:Experimental design: Seventy-one first-year medical students were stratified by previous test scores into problem-based learning tutorial groups, and then these assigned groups were randomized further into intervention and control groups. All students received evidence-based medicine (EBM) training. Only the intervention group members received SPA training, practice with assessment rubrics, and then application of anonymous SPA to assignments submitted by other members of the intervention group. Results:Students in the intervention group had higher mean scores on the formative test with a potential maximum score of 49 points than did students in the control group, 45.7 and 43.5, respectively (P = 0.06). Conclusions:SPA training and the application of these skills by the intervention group resulted in higher scores on formative tests compared to those in the control group, a difference approaching statistical significance. The extra effort expended by librarians, other personnel, and medical students must be factored into the decision to use SPA in any specific educational context.

The students have to conduct significant projects and cope with realistic working conditions and scenarios. PBL is generally done by groups of students working together towards a common goal. Several factors play a significant role on the final success of each group. It is not only the technical aspects that have an influence on their final achievements, but also the human aspects and group dynamics. These dynamics can be studied through personality assessments, the Myers-Brigss Type Indicator (MBTI) being one of the most used and well-known methods. The MBTI is a psychometric questionnaire designed to measure psychological preferences in how people perceive the world and make decisions. Although MBTI strictly speaking just only identifies a personality type of an individual, it taps into key aspects of personality and behavior in areas such as communication, problem solving, decision making, and interpersonal relations. Several studies have also related MBTI profiles with leadership styles. The MBTI also helps in understanding group dynamics, analyzing shortcomings in an individual's style and how the style affects the group as a whole. MBTI has been widely used in Team Building, Conflict Resolutions, Communication Skills and Understanding. The purpose of this work is to study how different combinations of student profiles could explain different group dynamics and at the same time, to predict the final success in a group. Knowing more about the personality of the team members, their leadership styles and how different personalities get along or conflict with each other can be useful information for building successful PBL groups. To this purpose, the final results of eight different student groups are analyzed, studying the influence of the MBTI profiles of their members with the group success. The final results obtained in this study suggest that the leadership style associated with the profile of the student playing the role of group coordinator and the members' profile combinations have an influence on the group's success. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.",,"Int J Technol Des Educ",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84887224084

Industrial and organizational psychologists study teams in the industry settings for which we prepare students, yet this research does not effectively inform engineering education. Purpose: This research review sought to demonstrate the relevance of literature on teams literature from industrial and organizational psychology to engineering education and to identify implications for practice and future directions for research. Scope/Method: Phase 1 systematically reviewed 104 articles published from 2007 to 2012 describing engineering and computer science student team projects and sought to answer the following questions: What professional learning outcomes have been met by team projects? What negative student team behaviors have faculty sought to minimize? What literature has been used to inform development of teamwork outcomes? Phase 2 reviewed five team effectiveness constructs selected according to the results of Phase 1: social loafing, interdependence, conflict, trust, and shared mental models. Examples from Phase 1 articles and our own work explain how this research informs facilitation and assessment of engineering student teams. Conclusions: Engineering faculty sought to achieve a variety of outcomes through team projects, including teamwork, communication, sustainability, and consideration of global/societal design context. They sought to avoid social loafing and conflict while building trust to ensure equal team effort.

The capstone design sequence at Florida International University consists of three courses for a total of 7 credit-hours over two semesters. Significant effort by the entire faculty is required for a successful outcome and to ensure that all students receive a ""major design experience"" and that there is consistency in expectations and outcomes among the students and croups. One of the creative components of the program at FIU is that near the end of the first semester of the senior design course sequence a committee of faculty members reviews each group's project design written proposal and critiques a 20 minute oral presentation of their proposal during about 40 minutes of questioning. The team's company sponsor and faculty advisor also attends and participates in the oral proposal defense. The faculty panel then approves the project, does not approve the project, or suggests an expansion or reduction in the scope. Close coordination with the company or faculty advisor ensures that the project meets the curriculum requirements of the program and that the scope of the project is realistic. An assessment tool is completed by each panel member, which is also used to provide input for the students' grades. In the second semester students complete the project and give a written report and oral presentation to a panel made up of members of the department's Industry Advisory Board. Students attend weekly lectures by experts on various topics critical to the success of practicing engineers, including regulatory, intellectual property, marketing, prototyping, responsible conduct of research, and others. These sessions also serve to monitor student and team progress. Multiple assessment tools are used to evaluate student learning. Other assessment tools, such as a Self-&-Peer evaluation and a Work Effort Certification are used to assess team work.

The design experience develops the students' lifelong learning skills, self-evaluations, self-discovery, and peer instruction in the design's creation, critique, and justification. Students learn to understand the manufacturer data sheets, application notes, and technical manuals. The experience, which would be difficult to complete individually, gives the students a sense of satisfaction and the accomplishment that is often lacking in many engineering courses, using traditional teaching approaches. Furthermore, the design experience motivates student learning and develops skills required in industry. The use of computer software packages for simulation and modeling to verify concepts and compare the results, giving the students additional skills necessary in the present day industrial settings. This paper discusses the development of a student project in marine and costal environment monitoring. The project involves a team of final year undergraduate students at our engineering technology program. A simple, low cost wireless sensor network with inherently long operation lifetime, developed based on low cost sensor nodes is proposed in this project. The sensor node is powered by a hybrid solar/PV and microwind power system with super-capacitor and batteries as backup units. The proposed sensing platform has the potential to be used as distributed sensing device to deploy in high density to give high spatial and high temporal water quality data, being designed for monitoring a coastal shallow water marine environment, measuring various parameters, such as temperature, humidity, pressure, etc. The sensor node takes the measured atmospheric and oceanographic data and sends them to the sink node using the wireless communication. The description of this system, the system characteristics, performances, the buoy prototype and the user application are presented in details. Various aspects of the educational experience are examined such as the educational goals of the project, project organization, and outcomes. Innovative educational approaches are described such as brainstorming session and discussion with students of highlevel choices described by a decision tree, component selections, simulations and system performance and characteristics computation. In the second part of the paper the design solution that was adopted is described in details. The adopted design solution includes: power electronics circuitry (DC-DC converter design and test), maximum power point tracking algorithms, control strategies, battery and super-capacitor selection as energy buffers, and overall system performances. The project is a good example of multi-disciplinary cooperation as well as providing valuable hands-on experimental experience. In addition to providing useful lessons in teamwork, component selection and project management, the project provides a working demonstration of wireless sensor monitoring network and energy harvesting system. The goal of the design project is to explore and enhance students understanding of the fundamental engineering principles, power circuit simulation capabilities, sensors and instrumentation and environment monitoring issues, as well as hands- on demonstration of system prototyping. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2013.",,"ASEE Annu.

This free, web-based software was developed for collecting real-time formative assessment of learning, but using it in this setting effectively mitigates many of the social issues that typically plague brainstorming in a group setting. The focus, instead, is on paying attention to the ideas of others while encouraging fluency, originality, and honing positive critical thinking skills. This emphasis is reflected as the group creates a metric to evaluate their potential solutions. A specific case from undergraduate and graduate level engineering physics courses is described to illustrate how the extensive work done in this arena in psychology, marketing, and business environments can be applied to STEM education. Students were presented with the problem of how to measure the mass removed from a quarry. The classroom process is outlined and actual student results are presented to illustrate the method for other instructors who might be interested in employing similar activities in a non-threatening, low-stakes learning environment. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2013.",,"ASEE Annu.

This paper focuses on the question: In a PBL environment, how do students perceive the interplay between individual and group creativity? Empirically, qualitative interviews were carried out with 53 students (12 groups) in Computer Science, Electronic Systems, Architecture and Design, and Medialogy at Aalborg University, Denmark. The data analysis shows that there are three aspects to the influences of a PBL environment on the interplay between individual and group creativity: (1) the project as ""an extra member"" in student groups; (2) tacit modes of collaboration in student groups; and (3) students have both domain-general and domain-specific understandings of creativity. These findings suggest the need for improved approaches to develop creativity in the PBL environment. © 2013 TEMPUS Publications.",,"Int. J. Eng.

We sought to unify a fragmented literature and assess the efficacy of debriefs with a quantitative review. Background: Used by the U.S. Army to improve performance for decades, and increasingly in medical, aviation, and other communities, debriefs systematize reflection, discussion, and goal setting to promote experiential learning. Unfortunately, research and theory on debriefing has been spread across diverse disciplines, so it has been difficult to definitively ascertain debriefing effectiveness and how to enhance its effectiveness. Method: We conducted an extensive quantitative meta-analysis across a diverse body of published and unpublished research on team- and individual-level debriefs. Results: Findings from 46 samples (N = 2,136) indicate that on average, debriefs improve effectiveness over a control group by approximately 25% (d = .67). Average effect sizes were similar for teams and individuals, across simulated and real settings, for withinor between-group control designs, and for medical and nonmedical samples. Meta-analytic methods revealed a bolstering effect of alignment and the potential impact of facilitation and structure. Conclusion: Organizations can improve individual and team performance by approximately 20% to 25% by using properly conducted debriefs. Application: Debriefs are a relatively inexpensive and quick intervention for enhancing performance. Our results lend support for continued and expanded use of debriefing in training and in situ. To gain maximum results, it is important to ensure alignment between participants, focus and intent, and level of measurement. Copyright © 2012, Human Factors and Ergonomics Society.",,"Hum.

Researchers of IS Education have largely overlooked Team Emotional Intelligence (TEI), which offers a collective cognitive skill that may benefit the student learning experience. Hypothesized are four dimensions of emotional intelligence (EI) that influence perceived effectiveness in IS learning teams. This paper proposes a model that explains how these four dimensions influence perceived team effectiveness and how gender affects this relationship. A survey administered to 384 students resulting in 94 IS learning teams produced regression (and moderated regression) results showing that gender, along with two TEI dimensions (awareness and management of one's own emotion) predict team effectiveness. Significant results suggest gender differences in the relationship between a team member's awareness of his or her own emotions, management of others' emotions, and team effectiveness. These findings suggest IS educators should focus on targeted interventions that may help to foster the development of emotionally intelligent IS learning teams. Most prominently, gender plays an important role for emotional intelligence competencies, where differences exist in awareness of one's own emotions and management of others' emotions among student learning teams.","Journal of Information Systems Education","J.

The results show that assessment designed as a group project helped close the gap in communication and interactions between different-ability students within groups. When the students engaged with assessment as a group project, all levels of performers increased productive learning behaviours and provided more relevant verbal help and assistance to each other.

Therefore it is fundamental for software engineering students to improve such skills, if they want to accelerate the success of teamwork. Nowadays, the ability of effective cooperation and communication is much more important than raw programming talent. Teams with average programmers who communicate well are more likely to success than those with superstars but not good at communication. At the same time, these soft skills are just difficult to teach and learn which require true collaboration and communication between students. The traditional learning activities for training soft skills are insufficient based on the facts that teachers and mentors pay too much attention on professional and technical abilities instead of soft skills. In this paper, a novel learning model called Problem and Task Based Learning is proposed which includes Problem-Based Learning, Task-Based Learning, and Web3D technologies. This new model could elevate the teamwork skills in software engineering and overcome the common limitations of the traditional course.

The robot design has many features specific to educators: It is advanced enough for academic research, has a broad feature set to support a wide range of curricula, and is inexpensive enough to be an effective outreach tool. The low cost allows each student to have their own robot for the semester, so they can work on activities outside the classroom. This robot was used in three different classes in which it was the foundation for an innovative problem-based learning curriculum. In particular, the robot has specialized sensors and a communications system that supports novel multi-robot curricula, which encourage student interaction in new ways. The results are promising; the robot was a big success in graduate, undergraduate, and outreach activities.

Rather, their potential only manifests when people make sense of and incorporate them into their day-to-day work practices. In this paper we consolidate three years of case study research into ESN adoption and use. We are able to demonstrate empirically the contextual nature of ESN as an emergent phenomenon that takes on different forms in different organisational contexts. Drawing on this data we derive a theory of ESN usage, which employs a set of use cases to provide a better picture of the possibilities of ESN when appropriated into team, project or large enterprise contexts. This allows reflecting on ESN as a contextual phenomenon and social infrastructure and builds a basis for further research.","Association for Information Systems","ECIS - Proc. Eur. Conf. Inf.

On one hand, they inadequately prepare engineering students to engage in collaborative partnerships (essential for the practicing engineer) and, on the other hand, they promote passive learning and contribute to a compartmentalized curriculum. These strategies may not prepare students for the innovative and flexible role of engineers in today's society. Using non-traditional learning strategies is essential to prepare engineers ready to succeed in their professional life. To contribute to enhancing the problem solving skills and higher order thinking of the graduates in Civil Engineering program of University of Aveiro, Portugal, two complementary courses on Geotechnical subjects have been redesigned using non-traditional learning models: Soil Mechanics I and II. The non-traditional strategies include cooperative and collaborative learning models using team projects or problems. These models have been implemented since 2007/2008. The nontraditional learning strategies used are described and discussed, pointing out how they can contribute to the development of problem solving and high order thinking skills. The students' reactions to these models are addressed and the strategies implemented to promote their acceptance are presented. To assess the impact of the models implemented three different and complementary strategies were used: students' feedback during the semester; monitoring of marks; questionnaires at the end of the semester. The evolution of the students' response to these models is discussed using data collected in the courses.

Firms are increasingly turning to group project and teamwork structures to perform these tasks. Simply focusing on group members' engagement is insufficient to account for the ability of the firm to face challenges and the need to coordinate the efforts of hundreds of workers. Thus, group efficacy is used to represent a group's collective estimate of its own ability to perform a task objective. Based on multilevel theory, groups are inherently multilevel phenomena. Although the theoretical development of group efficacy has been discussed, few studies have used multilevel analyses to empirically test efficacy beliefs. This study integrates efficacy beliefs at the individual and group levels into a more comprehensive research framework. The findings show that, at the individual level, both learning orientation and affective commitment influence self-efficacy, and further impact knowledge sharing behavior. At the group level, this study confirms the mediation effects of entrepreneurial orientation on the relationship between group efficacy and innovativeness effectiveness. Training not only affects self-efficacy, but also moderates the relationship between learning orientation and self-efficacy. The findings also show that group knowledge sharing moderates the relationship between entrepreneurial orientation and innovation behavior.","Pacific Asia Conference on Information Systems","Proc. - Pac.

Witnessing the popularity of these SNSs, educational researchers have also explored the potential educational value of using SNSs. Despite the few studies that have investigated learners' attitudes toward and the effects of incorporating SNSs in class, limited attention has been paid to examining learners' knowledge and cognitive processes involved in online discussions using SNSs. Although general public interest in life-long learning has been gradually increasing, relatively little attention has been devoted to exploring the application of SNSs in adult and continuing education programs. To promote a better understanding of using SNSs in learning, this study seeks to explore learners' online discussion behaviors in an art course that involved a project-based learning activity using a popular SNS, Facebook, to support students' asynchronous online discussions. The participants in our study included 62 students enrolled in the school of continuing education at a university in northern Taiwan. Adapting the Revised Bloom's Taxonomy as a coding scheme, this study employed a quantitative content analysis (QCA) and lag sequential analysis (LSA) to examine the content and behavioral patterns of students' discussions. The results indicate that the most prominent knowledge dimension in students' discussions is the meta-cognitive knowledge, while the cognitive process is primarily focused on understanding and comprehension. In addition, a moderate proportion of off-topic discussion was found in this study. Considering the different behaviors that may be exhibited by members of varied age and gender, a further analysis based on students' individual differences was conducted. The results showed that, in the context of online discussions, female and older learners are more likely to engage in off-topic discussions. Based on these findings, this study suggests that when conducting online discussion activities using SNSs, instructors should consider the characteristics of adult learners and their individual differences and design their teaching activities accordingly. Implications and limitations of this study are discussed, and pedagogical suggestions for adapting SNSs to teaching activities for adult and continuing education are proposed. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

It enables collaboration, but the specific choice of technology also imposes constraints on how projects are conducted. Over the past decade, we have engaged in an action research programme to develop an Open-Ended Group Project situated in an educational framework in which international collaboration, including interaction with a real world client, is an essential component. This paper investigates the manner in which students reflected on their patterns of CT use within the collaborative setting. In general, these reflections were found to be superficial and descriptive, exhibiting a reductive view of CT as a set of technological features, which acted as a neutral medium for communication and participation. One consequence of this was a lack of awareness of the ways in which the technology influenced the behaviour of individual students or the collaborative nature of the group. We explore some potential causes for this and reflect on some difficulties faced by the students. These have important pedagogical implications for courses in which the learning objectives include the development of suitable competencies for working in a global collaborative environment. © 2012 IEEE.",,"Proc.

A better understanding would provide opportunities for improving the collaboration, and more importantly is that a better understanding would improve the possibility of scaffolding, and student learning in general. In this paper we present results from a study of students' use of CTs in a globally distributed project with a focus on the challenges encountered in trying to collaborate using this technology. The study is focused on a few aspects of how a combination of CTs could be utilized and issues associated with their set up and adaption for use.

These environments provide unique constraints (e.g., cultures where people are unfamiliar with or afraid of technology, environments where power and network connectivity are scarce and expensive). Students are partnered with organizations interested in piloting a solution they devise. The course brings together multidisciplinary teams of students to conduct fieldwork with potential user populations, design a technology to solve a problem inspired by a community-based organization, implement a solution, and evaluate that solution. Students work on projects with real-world impact and gain valuable experience with multidisciplinary design and multidisciplinary team work.

In addition, the constructivist pedagogical approach to instructional design has also rekindled interest in Problem Based Learning. PBL is characterized by Problem stimulating learning; group work stimulating interaction and tutors facilitating it. There have been perceptions that PBL is meant for the independent learner (gifted) alone; it is unsuitable for young students in that the self-directed study component of PBL can be difficult for them. It could be argued that either Kiili's Problem-Based Gaming Model conception rests on these perceptions, thus the emphasis on reflective-thinking or the model is restricted to independent problem solving thus robbing children the chance of reaching their level of potential development through support from teachers and collaborating with more capable peers. Be it as it may, in contrast it has been revealed that the benefits of PBL represent valuable educational goals for all learners, not just for the gifted or independent problem solvers. Though reflection is an element of PBL, so is scaffolding. Scaffolding is based on the Vygotzkian Zone of Proximal Development (ZPD) concept which refers to the distance between the actual development level as determined by independent problem solving and the level of potential development as determined through problem solving under adult guidance, or in collaboration with more capable peers. Providing support for children (primary six) could be a daunting task, placing a high demand on the teacher's time considering the varied ZPDs. The aim of this work is to design a serious game framework with an effective scaffolding mechanism which can be fine-tuned to suit various ZPDs. This would be done to make teacher's support for Problem Based Learning less daunting in addition to engaging the children. This is particularly important because the child stand to gain problem-solving skills and a positive attitude toward learning.",,"Proc. European Conf.

More often than not however, students are still losing interest in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) education because current educational teaching pedagogies have become antiquated and are not impacting student learning, as it should. With that said, our discovery through elicitation of high school educators has cited the main reason for such disinterest is due to the inability of students to connect STEM abstract concepts and theory with STEM application to appreciate the value of learning STEM. With access to information easier than ever, students are forgetting that learning is not about getting the right answer but understanding how to solve a complex problem. In the past, PBL has benefited students in engaging them in hands-on learning however, with a more complex paradigm shift in student learning style, PBL and lecture-based learning are no longer the most effective methods of teaching. Engineering-based learning has the opportunity and potential to modify STEM education and revolutionize STEM teaching pedagogy by changing the one-size-fits-all model to an individual, student-centered learning approach where education is mass customized. This paper discusses a new teaching pedagogy dubbed Engineering-Based Learning (EBL) that is a more systematic approach to high school STEM teaching for open-ended problems. This paper presents the EBL model, the EBL tools, and its impact thus far on high school students. It also presents sample feedback from both teachers and students and how it has influenced their outlook of engineering and STEM in the real world. The purpose of this paper is also to disseminate this new teaching pedagogy to support the notion that STEM education can be successfully taught and provide students with a structured, systematic, hands-on approach, as well as the appropriate tools and resources allowing them to connect complex STEM theory and real-world application.

At the same time, the information technology (IT) industry and the Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology (ABET) are demanding soft skills training. Thus, in designing an IT course, we devised group teaching projects where students learn to work with peers in a constructive and cooperative manner as they achieve deep learning by fulfilling their teaching responsibilities. The collective student effort provided the amount of tutoring required to cover JSP, PHP, Ajax, XML, HTML5, and RSS, which would be impossible for one instructor. While the group project provides excellent opportunities for soft skills training and deep learning, its practical realization is difficult to assess. Group activities often take place outside of the classroom, and instructors are kept out of communication and interaction loops. This may lead to a freerider problem where some students are awarded the same grades as others who contribute more than their fair share of the work. To address this problem, we designed and administered two peer assessment tools. This paper reports the students' response to the course design and shares two soft skills assessment tools with IT educators in an effort to meet the demands of the IT industry and ABET.

Providing insight into their actual level of collaboration requires a means to assess practice within health settings. This chapter reports on the development, testing, and refinement process for the Assessment of Interprofessional Team Collaboration Scale (AITCS). There is a paucity of literature and measurement tools addressing interprofessional collaborative team performance and the nature of effective teamwork processes and patient roles within collaborative teams. These gaps limit our knowledge about how health care teams form and function. Instruments are therefore needed to assess collaborative relationships. Methods: The AITCS, with its 47 items within 4 subscales (partnership, cooperation, coordination, and shared decision making) and assessed on a 5-point Likert scale, was administered to a total of 125 practitioners from 7 health care teams practicing within a variety of settings, in 2 provinces in Canada. Results: Principal components and factor analysis of data resulted in 37 items loading onto 3 factors, explaining 61.02% of the variance. The internal consistency estimates for reliability of each subscale ranged from 0.80 to 0.97, with an overall reliability of 0.98. Thus, the AITCS is a reliable and valid instrument. Discussion: The psychometric analysis of this instrument supports its value in measuring collaboration within teams and when patients are included as team members. The AITCS can be applied to continuing professional education interventions to determine change over time. It has limitations to the Canadian context and within the settings where participants practiced. Further test and retest reliability and longitudinal study application is needed. © 2012 The Alliance for Continuing Education in the Health Professions, the Society for Academic Continuing Medical Education, and the Council on CME, Association for Hospital Medical Education.",,"J.

The engineering program at James Madison University (JMU), however, emphasizes these real-world, client-based design experiences, and places them throughout our six-course engineering design sequence. Our six-course design sequence is anchored by the sophomore design course sequence, which serves as the cornerstone to the JMU engineering design sequence. The cornerstone experience in the sophomore year is meant to enable mastery through both directed and non-directed learning and exploration of the design process and design tools. To that end, students work in both small (4-5) and large (9-11) teams to complete a year-long design project. The course project is woven with instruction in engineering design theory and methodology; individual cognitive processes, thinking, and communication skills; decision making; sustainable design; problem solving; software; and project management. Students' overarching task during the first semester is to follow the first two phases of the engineering design process- Planning and Concept Generation-while in the second semester, students work to reiterate on the first two phases of the engineering design process before prototyping, testing, and refining a design for the client. The project culminates with the students demonstrating their final product to the client, University, and local community. Our goal in this paper is to present our model for integrating real-world, client-based design projects into the sophomore year to facilitate meaningful design experiences across the curriculum. We believe that providing these experiences early and often not only challenges students on multiple dimensions, but also exposes them, and consequently better prepares them, for their eventual role as a practicing engineer. In this paper, we shall describe the sophomore design course sequence, the history and details of the course project, and also key learning outcome gains. Copyright © 2012 by ASME.",,"Proc. ASME Des.

Such improvement project teams focus on deliberate learning, which differs from the primary focus of work teams. Our analysis uses archival data generated by these improvement project teams over a six year time span. Of the four experience variables we study, we find that team leader experience exhibits the strongest relationship with project success, followed by organizational experience. Further, in contrast to prior-related research on work teams, we find no relationship between individual experience or team familiarity and project success beyond that explained by team leader and organizational experience.

Students from the Department of Computing (COMP) and the School of Hotel and Tourism Management (SHTM) are involved as partners and team members to work on joint student projects. One group of SHTM students is planning a conference event in 2012 with over 300 guests. These students act as the clients who require a banquet management system as well as a delegates managing application. Another group of SHTM students is to manage the development projects with the support of IT consultants who are in fact the COMP students. During the Fall semester, different communication channels have been set up to facilitate the inter-group and intra-group communications with the support offered by an e-learning system, Blackboard. Furthermore, there are classroom presentations given by the SHTM students and prototype demonstrations prepared by the COMP students. Pre-project and post-project questionnaires have been given to all participating students in order to assess their gain in professional and business knowledge in 2 different areas, namely database application development and conference management. During the Spring semester, another group of COMP students continued the development and made the 2 systems available on the Web.

Hence, the purpose of this paper is to develop a conceptual model of critical success factors (CSFs) for software development projects, categorize the success factors, finding the factors in each category and highlighting the product, team, project management and communication factors as important categories of success factors for software projects. Design/methodology/approach: A conceptual model and seven categories of success factors comprising a total of 80 success factors for software development projects were identified based on the thorough literature review. These 80 factors are collected based on their importance to software projects and their repeated occurrence in the literature related to CSFs. Based on the occurrence of the success factor in the literature, each category comprising top five success factors are identified as critical success factors for software projects. Based on these seven categories of success factors a conceptual model was developed. Findings: A total of 35 CSFs from seven CSF categories are identified from secondary research of the CSFs for software development projects. The identified CSFs include communication in project, top management support, clear project goal, reliability of output, project planning, teamwork, project team coordination, quality control, client acceptance, accuracy of output, reduce ambiguity, maximize stability, realistic expectations and user involvement. Project management, product, team and communication factors are identified as important categories of success factors for software projects. Research limitations/implications: Different categories of critical success factors such as product, project management, team and communication, which were not highlighted or categorized earlier in the literature are discussed in this current work. Practical implications: This research is definitely useful for organizations working on software projects. The project managers working in the industry can benefit from the mentioned critical success factors and the categories of factors by concentration on them while planning and executing software projects. Originality/value: The conceptual model, categorization of CSFs, identifying 35 CSFs for software projects and highlighting product, team and communication factors are major contributions of this research work. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.",,"J.

One important feature of P2P systems explored in this context is that of direct peer-to-peer communication. It has been shown in several recent research works that the direct communication between peers increases the interaction among peers and eventually the social and emotive support through peer-to-peer learning. Thus, P2P infrastructure helps creating a small social networking in online groups, in which end users (peers at the edges of the Internet) can benefit from using a P2P infrastructure and thus overcome the limitations of reduced social interaction in web-based e-Learning systems. However, due to the dynamics of peers joining and leaving the system in an unexpected manner, such systems strive to provide availability of information. In this work we propose a replication-aware approach to increase availability of information in P2P super-peer systems. Our context is that of project-based learning in which members of a peer group work together online to accomplish a common project although our replication scheme can be used also for multimedia content distribution of learning objects. © 2012 Crown Copyright.",,"Proc. - Int.

Anchoring upon and informed by the existing literature, two design characteristics - sociability and visibility.; two human characteristics - gender and age, are focused on, which are salient in online collaboration applications. A field experiment was conducted to examine the direct and moderating effects of design and human characteristics on learning outcomes. The research found that sociability improved process satisfaction and positive social environment while visibility enhanced academic performance and solution satisfaction of learners. Males had higher solution satisfaction while older learners had higher academic performance. Moderating effects were also found. Both theoretical and practical implications are drawn. In particular, a rubric for online collaboration application selection for academic performance is conceived.

The need for the development of competencies raised an incremental interest in applying innovative approaches in Engineering Education. One of the methodologies used in this context is Project-Based Learning (PBL). At the University of Brasilia, a course degree in Production Engineering was created having as a main reference the Project-Based Learning (PBL) approach. The use of PBL implies a change of behavior of teachers who play a main role of facilitators of competencies development, and of the students, who learn in a collaborative way, working with others in teams. Students' working in team and developing a project during a semester will require e?ective coordination models. The objective of this paper is to propose a model of coordination among students' teams based on project management knowledge. Furthermore, a qualitative approach is applied to evaluate the application of this model during one semester. The results show that a coordination model for student teams developing projects is important to support their learning process, which is not solely dependent on students, as teachers/tutors have an important role before, during and at the end of the project. The tutor is especially important, as he/she is responsible for supporting the teams in several project management dimensions. This is an essential support for students to know how to manage the team, communicate, de?ne goals, carry out the activities on time, plan the milestones and understand the impact of their decisions. These competencies are also part of student learning and are an important part of engineering education. © 2012 TEMPUS Publications.",,"Int. J. Eng. Educ.",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84865128820

Although the use of group work in higher education has sound pedagogical reasons and advantages, group work has its own drawbacks. Therefore, the acceptance by students and the success of group work critically depend on a fair and credible assessment of the group process. In this paper, the implementation of different approaches to peer assessment (PA) of individuals' contributions to group projects in two core units in an undergraduate construction management course in an Australian university is reported. The effectiveness of the adopted PA approaches have been evaluated and validated by students. It has been found that contrary to doubts of the sufficiency of a simplistic approach to PAs, the fairness of a PA approach does not necessarily depend on its complexity. Besides, voluntary group discussions, learning and collaboration are found to aid in improving each of the group's camaraderie. Hence, it is recommended that academics should develop both a structured methodology to progressively encourage group members to work cohesively in teams and effective PA approaches that measure individual member's contribution. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",,"Assess.

The authors describe experiences from a course that focuses on modes of learning involving virtual collaboration, problem-oriented project-based learning, and role-based learning. The aim of this course is to combine experimental and experiential learning into a research driven experience. The course was codesigned and cotaught by two instructors from two universities. The learning outcomes and lessons learned during the introduction of this building information modeling (BIM)-enabled virtual and collaborative construction engineering and management course are discussed. Specifically, it is shown that the introduction of BIM in a virtual collaborative setting allows instructors to design a course that incorporates the use of more realistic scenarios that better simulate real-world challenges. Such experiences teach students how construction projects are executed in practice, how different disciplines rely on one other for information, what type of information is needed from relevant disciplines, and when and how this information could be exchanged/shared between tools and processes. © 2012 American Society of Civil Engineers.",,"J Prof Issues Eng Educ Pract",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84873328635

An example of the implementation of this technology in a web-based pilot course for acute mental health nurses is given. This particular virtual patient technique is a simulation type ideally suited to promoting essential mental health nursing skills such as critical thinking, communication and decision making. Furthermore, it is argued that it is particularly amenable to e-learning and blended learning environments, as well as being an apt tool where multilingual simulations are required.

During the engineering science revolution, curricula moved from hands-on practice to mathematical modeling and scientific analyses. The first shift was initiated by engineering faculty members from Europe; accelerated during World War II, when physicists contributed multiple engineering breakthroughs; codified in the Grinter report; and kick-started by Sputnik. Did accreditation hinder curricular innovations? Were engineering graduates ready for practice? Spurred by these questions, the Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology (ABET) required engineering programs to formulate outcomes, systematically assess achievement, and continuously improve student learning. The last three shifts are in progress. Since the engineering science revolution may have marginalized design, a distinctive feature of engineering, faculty members refocused attention on capstone and first-year engineering design courses. However, this third shift has not affected the two years in between. Fourth, research on learning and education continues to influence engineering education. Examples include learning outcomes and teaching approaches, such as cooperative learning and inquiry that increase student engagement. In shift five, technologies (e.g., the Internet, intelligent tutors, personal computers, and simulations) have been predicted to transform education for over 50 years; however, broad transformation has not yet been observed. Together, these five shifts characterize changes in engineering education over the past 100 years. © 2012 IEEE.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","Proc.

However, nursing students' perceptions of PA have not been well studied. This paper examines baccalaureate nursing students' perceptions of PA in assessing individual contributions to a group project. Using a case study design with both quantitative (an anonymous survey with 123 students), and qualitative methods (six focus group interviews with 21 students), data were collected from students in a baccalaureate nursing programme. Merging of quantitative and qualitative findings indicated that students overall had positive perceptions of PA, especially its ability to reduce 'free-riding'. However, students also had some interpersonal and operational concerns about the PA implementation process. Based on the findings, we recommend: (1) further developing students' abilities to assess the contributions of others to the task and relationship functions in group work; and (2) adopting a confidential online system for submission of PA forms. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.",,"Nurse Educ.

Researchers have established that teams with high levels of social sensitivity tend to perform well when completing a variety of specific collaborative tasks. Social sensitivity is the personal ability to perceive, understand, and respect the feelings and viewpoints of others, and it is reliably measurable. However, the tasks in recent research have been primarily short term, requiring only hours to finish, whereas major project teams work together for longer durations and on complex tasks. Our claim is that, social sensitivity can be a key component in predicting the performance of teams that carry out major projects. Our goal is to determine if previous research, which was not focused on students or professionals in scientific or technical fields, is germane for people in computing disciplines. This paper reports the results from an empirical study that investigates whether social sensitivity is correlated with the performance of student teams on large semester-long projects. The overall result supports our claim that the team social sensitivity is highly correlated with successful team performance. It suggests, therefore, that educators in computer-related disciplines, as well as computer professionals in the workforce, should take the concept of social sensitivity seriously as an aid or obstacle to productivity. © 2012 ACM.",,"SIGCSE - Proc.

We specifically discuss the application of theories that support the social dimensions of interprofessional learning and teaching, choosing by way of illustration the theory of social capital, adult learning theory and a sociological perspective of interprofessional education. We introduce some of the key ideas behind each theory and then apply these to a case study about the development and delivery of interprofessional education for pre-registration healthcare sciences students. We suggest a model that assists with the management of the numerous theories potentially available to the interprofessional educator. In this model, context is central and a range of dimensions are presented for the reader to decide which, when, why and how to use a theory. We also present some practical guidelines of how theories may be translated into tangible curriculum opportunities. Using social capital theory, we show how theory can be used to defend and present the benefits of learning in an interprofessional group. We also show how this theory can guide thinking as to how interprofessional learning networks can best be constructed to achieve these benefits. Using adult learning theories, we explore the rationale and importance of problem solving, facilitation and scaffolding in the design of interprofessional curricula. Finally, from a sociological perspective, using Bernstein's concepts of regions and terrains, we explore the concepts of socialisation as a means of understanding the resistance to interprofessional education sometimes experienced by curriculum developers. We advocate for new, parallel ways of viewing professional knowledge and the development of an interprofessional knowledge terrain that is understood and is contributed to by all practitioners and, importantly, is centred on the needs of the patient or client. Through practical application of theory, we anticipate that our readers will be able to reflect and inform their current habitual practices and develop new and innovative ways of perceiving and developing their interprofessional education practice. © 2012 Informa UK Ltd All rights reserved: reproduction in whole or part not permitted.",,"Med.

Group activities often take place outside classroom, and instructors are kept out of communication and interaction loops. Free-rider problems arise when some students are doing less work and awarded the same grades as others who contribute more.

To address this problem, the STEM-PBL project of the New England Board of Higher Education, funded by the National Science Foundation Advanced Technological Education (NSF-ATE) program, has created a comprehensive series of multimedia PBL ""Challenges"" focused on sustainable technologies, and training in their use for pre-service and in-service STEM teachers. In this paper, we present the results of a pilot study conducted to examine the impact of a model PBL methods course based on the STEM PBL Challenges on the knowledge, skills, and attitudes of pre-service K-12 STEM educators with regard to the use of PBL in Technology and Engineering Education (TEE). During the spring 2011 semester, 14 pre-service TEE students enrolled in at Central Connecticut State University participated in the PBL methods course. Qualitative and quantitative methods were used to assess students' motivation, self-efficacy, critical thinking, and metacognitive self-regulation resulting from engagement with the STEM PBL Challenges using selected scales from the Motivated Strategies for Learning Questionnaire (MSLQ). Data were corroborated through focus group interviews with students. While results of pre-post assessments showed overall gains in extrinsic motivation, self-efficacy, critical thinking and metacognitive self-regulation, only critical thinking was statistically significant. Pre-post assessment of content knowledge with regard to PBL methods was also significant. © 2012 American Society for Engineering Education.","American Society for Engineering Education","ASEE Annu.

This paper outlines the development of an education program for Ph.D. course students to cultivate literacy and competency, in addition to comprising doctoral theses and highlighting the ability to achieve results through innovative research of new themes. The program aims to cultivate fundamental attainment (the fundamentals of natural and social sciences, such as mathematics, physics, chemistry, and biology), specialized knowledge (mechanical dynamics, material mechanics, hydrodynamics, thermodynamics, design engineering, manufacturing engineering, and material engineering, as well as a bird's-eye view knowledge of technology, society, and the environment), literacy (language, information literacy, technological literacy, legal knowledge, and ethics), and competency (creativity, problem identification and solution, planning and execution, self-management, teamwork, leadership, a sense of responsibility and duty). The program targets Ph.D. course students in the School of Engineering, which includes Mechanical Engineering, Aeronautics and Astronautics, Precision Engineering, Systems Innovation, Materials Engineering, Applied Chemistry, and Chemical Systems Engineering. The program focuses on (1) Cultivating a bird's-eye-view of the role of engineering in society, (2) Cultivating competitiveness based on international understanding and specialized knowledge, and (3) Cultivating leadership in industry and academia. The corresponding relationship between the educational objectives and the educational program is articulated, as it shows the contribution ratio of the four abilities that can be expected to be cultivated from each program. We instructed the students who enrolled in the program to take a survey with questions inquiring what type of coursework they felt contributed the most to attaining the four educational objectives: fundamental attainment, specialized knowledge, literacy, and competency. Figure 1 compare the ratio of education objectives between faculty setting and students feeling calculated by questionnaire. There are some differences, but overall tendency shows good agreement. We can confirm students feel to get literacy and competency from these education programs. We can change the faculty setting or can change contents of education program according to the student's voice. Also we can change the contribution ratio of four objectives. For example, students feels, Project based learning need fundamental achievement and specialized knowledge. This is because PBL theme is much more realistic engineering theme than the faculty expected. We very thanks to company members offer PBL theme. At this year objectives, we already changed the ratio of PBL. We plan to continue running this program, making continuous improvements in the curriculum based on the opinions of students who participated and industry members who cooperating with education programs. With these continuous improvements in the curriculum, we can foster human resources with multidisciplinary application skills that will actively engage in a wider range of areas.","European Society for Engineering Education (SEFI)","Proc.

A measure of self-efficacy for design teams provides grounding for the design of learning support. PURPOSE (HYPOTHESIS) This study aims to determine the usefulness of a measure of self-efficacy for cross-disciplinary team learning (CDTL) within a multi-disciplinary, project based setting. Research questions include: (1) Does student efficacy for CDTL change over the course of the semester? (2) What is the effect of (a) task complexity; (b) prior learner experience; (c) team composition; and (d) personal factors on efficacy for CDTL? DESIGN/METHOD Efficacy for CDTL while working on multi-disciplinary team projects was assessed using a 16-item Selfefficacy for CDTL scale. A total of 112 undergraduates from 34 teams in a service learning program completed both pre and post project questionnaires. RESULTS A statistically significant increase in pre-post semester self-efficacy was found across three team learning factors: identification, recognition, and integration. Individual GPA and year in college were related to higher levels of improvement in the identification factor, while the completion of multiple design phases in team tasks was related to lower levels of improvement in the identification factor. CONCLUSIONS This study contributes to our knowledge of individual self-efficacy and the design of learning environments involving multi-disciplinary teams. It is an important step toward the development of theory and evidence that can help higher educational institutions to better understand if and how students learn to collaborate while working on team design projects. © 2012 ASEE.","Wiley-Blackwell Publishing Ltd","J.

It allows students to take knowledge acquired through the program and apply it to an innovative industry or research project. A well designed senior project affords the student the opportunity to demonstrate the skills and to model the behaviour, which are inherent in the education goals of the program. Most capstone projects focus on technical skills but soft skills oftentimes are not built into the experience. During the past three years we have observed that a significant amount of Sr. Design teams in our Electrical Engineering (EE) department do not complete the projects in a timely manner. We find that lack of technical knowledge is rarely the cause; more often the causes include lack of communication skills, lack of experience in organizing work in a team environment, and a bias towards focusing on the device level at the expense of having a clear, high level end-to-end view of the project.

These notched tubes are joined to other tubes to produce frames for vehicles for student competitions (e.g., Mini Baja or human powered vehicles). This paper reviews mechanical design efforts, fabrication, assembly, derivation of axis trajectories, software development efforts, and the integration of the hardware and software components that resulted in a successful three-axis tube notcher. This multidisciplinary project required close cooperation between mechanical engineering and computer science students. The students in the first year of the project designed and built a two-axis (linear-rotary) CNC machining center. Particular emphasis was placed on determining the functional requirements of the design as set by the eventual ""customers"" in the Mini Baja and human powered vehicle groups. Different sub-groups of students focused on collet design (including finite-element analyses), mechanical design of the motion axes, cutting force tests for spindle sizing, servo tuning for the motion axes, and programming for readily converting solid models of the intended parts into trajectories. In the second phase of the project, two years later, the students increased the functionality by adding a third controlled axis to the machining center. This axis allowed the appropriate bevel to be cut on the tube ends for a flush mate to the adjoining part. This required a substantial rewrite of the user interface software, redesign of the mechanical systems for the integration of the third axis, metrology and calibration techniques, and a focused study on ergonomics and safety. This project concluded with a functional device that is in use by the student design teams as intended. The nature of the team interaction is described. Positive and negative aspects of the team experience are discussed. The project was made possible through the involvement of an industrial partner (Aerotech, Inc.) who provided equipment (actuators, controllers, and associated software), technical support, and input during design reviews. © 2012 American Society for Engineering Education.","American Society for Engineering Education","ASEE Annu.

The projects are a valuable component of the science and engineering education. The design experience develops the students' lifelong learning skills, self-evaluations, self-discovery, and peer instruction in the design's creation, critique, and justification. Students learn to understand and make use of the manufacturer data sheets, application notes, and technical manuals when developing their design projects. The experience, which would be difficult to complete individually, gives the students a sense of satisfaction and the accomplishment that is often lacking in many engineering courses, using traditional teaching approaches. Furthermore, the design experience motivates student learning and develops skills required in industry. This paper discusses the development of a student project involving a number of senior undergraduate students at our engineering technology program. A simple, low cost solar power system to power a wireless sensor network (WSN) was developed during this project. The proposed WSN may be used for monitoring a coastal shallow water marine environment. It is composed of several sensor nodes or buoys. The description of this harvester, the system characteristics and performances are presented in details. Various aspects of the educational experience are examined such as the educational goals of the project, project organization, and outcomes1-3. Innovative educational approaches are described such as brainstorming session and discussion with students of high-level choices described by a decision tree, component selections, simulations and system performance and characteristics computation. In the second part of the paper the design solution that was adopted is described in details. The adopted design solution includes: power electronics circuitry (DC-DC converter design and test), maximum power point tracking (MPPT) algorithms, control strategies, battery and super-capacitor selection as energy buffers, and overall system performances. Different MPPT and charging algorithms were analyzed and evaluated for their effectiveness in solar energy conversion system, as well as the control algorithms and implementation to maximize the power output. The project is a good example of multi-disciplinary cooperation as well as providing valuable hands-on experience. In addition to providing useful lessons in teamwork and project management, the project will provide a working demonstration wireless sensor network and solar energy system. The goal of the design project is to explore and enhance students understanding of the fundamental engineering principles, power circuit simulation capability and hands-on demonstration of system prototyping. © 2012 American Society for Engineering Education.","American Society for Engineering Education","ASEE Annu.

Engineers play a key role in transforming ideas and inventions into innovations that create value for users [1]. But successful innovation requires a broad set of skills that is beyond a profound technological knowledge, as for example communication skills, the ability to work in a team or competences in project management. The National Academy of Sciences [2] draws an interesting scenario for future engineers in the year 2020 referring to societal, global, and professional contexts of engineering practice. The most meaningful change with a tremendous impact on today's engineering education can be identified as an accelerating global economy. The world's economy has become increasingly interlinked over the last few decades due to technological innovations which unfolds the importance of efficient collaboration in international teams. Furthermore, the steady increase in knowledge leads to a growing complexity which requires a systems perspective on engineering problems. In consequence, the collaboration of multidisciplinary teams of experts is inevitable and shows the challenges in communication and teamwork which engineers will have to face. The academic outlook by the National Academy of Sciences summarizes in a very extensive way various perceptions concerning current developments in engineering education. Additional to a scientific point of view, challenges for today's engineering education can also be derived from industry's actual requirements. However, surveys (e.g. [3]; [4]) reveal a gap between the industry's needs and university curricula and graduates perceive similar lacks in education themselves. To successfully meet these needs a paradigm shift in engineering education that focuses on a more comprehensive approach and on the development of human potential is necessary (e.g. [5]). Hence, ways of implementing a holistic engineering education including approaches for sustainable career development will be discussed by using the example of MCI (Management Center Innstbruck), an Austrian engineering school. To complete the idea of supporting the individual development as professional and to increase the degree of adaptability to dynamic changes in global markets and technologies a reflective approach is introduced. Based on Weinert's understanding [6], competences are conceptualized as context-related dispositions that enable people to successfully solve problems. From an engineering educator's point of view, this draws the attention on how students can be supported in developing this sort of competence and what contribution can be made to foster this disposition and to facilitate a more holistic engineering education. Becoming a professional, in the sense of being a full member of a community of practice [7], is a lifelong process which additionally requires reflective competence in order to identify and develop one's individual potential. Thus, fostering reflective competence is supposed to be an indispensable part of engineering education. This way individual experience can be used more productively to increase engineering students' employability by actively designing their personalized curriculum and benefiting from individual talents. Preparing graduates for a lifelong learning process also has to include the preparation for the handling of individual experience in communities of practice. The reflective competence which is required to profit from experience and to increase the possibility of transfer can already be supported in engineering schools. The increased consideration of individual experience in learning processes and in the support of a sustainable career development shows how important it is to allow for experience not only during internships in companies but also during the whole technical study program. Therefore, creating a constructivist learning environment instead of the predominant model - ""talk and chalk"" [8] - in engineering education is necessary although not always easy to realize. But there are some promising approaches, e.g. project-based learning, that enable experience that is close to professional reality since the biggest part of an engineer's professional practice is project related. The paper ends with pointing out tools to enlarge the sustainability of practical experience which are suitable to accompany learning processes and foster the engagement with the individual learning history.","European Society for Engineering Education (SEFI)","Proc.

Decentralisation, direct and interactive communication, personalization and context are among the features of P2P systems that could be beneficial to groupware systems. In particular, such features can support monitoring, awareness, social networking and scaffolding in group collaboration. In this work we present an analysis of advantages in using P2P networks to better support group collaborative processes. In our analysis, P2P groupware systems are conceived as a convergence of several views: contextual computing, social media and semantic web. The contextual computing is an important ingredient to capture the context of the collaboration in a multi-dimension way, including workspace context, documents and information context, time and location contexts, etc. The social media is also considered important for an effective collaboration of peer group, to support members with efficient and scalable communication techniques in social interaction among members. The semantic web concepts and use of languages such as RDF/S enable the representation and reasoning with the diverse range of information required by the P2P middleware and the awareness services. We focus in particular how to achieve event-based awareness in P2P groupware systems that includes different forms of awareness. The user and technical requirements are first derived with reference to Project-Based Learning in P2P learning environments, which is the learning setting that we consider in our work. We then present our computational model for supporting group awareness in such environments and discuss how it meets the identified user and technical requirements. © 2011 IEEE.",,"Proc. - Int. Conf.

The ESG section of the 21W.732 writing subject inverts the communication and technical emphases found in upper-level engineering design subjects: in the ESG 21W.732, the emphasis is on communication rather than product design. The ESG 21W.732 curriculum asks students to work together both individually and in teams to conceive, design, prototype, and evaluate products; the communication assignments are coupled directly to this design cycle or to the humanistic aspects of engineering. Results suggest that students are engaged in this novel subject and value the experience. This interdisciplinary, hands-on, project-based, team-based communication class offers students a number of benefits above and beyond situated communication instruction, including the opportunity for first year students to explore engineering as a major, to learn (some) technical content driven by the projects, and to engage in genuine team project work. © 2011 IEEE.",,"Proc.

Under the proposed peer evaluation approach, the final project grade of an individual student is the sum of two components: the group project mark awarded by the lecturer and the contribution of the individual student to the team as assessed by other team members. Fifty-eight full-time computing students taking the module 'Project Work' at a post-secondary institution in Hong Kong were involved in this study. Data were collected from a questionnaire survey and a focus group interview. Findings revealed that participants strongly agreed that the proposed peer evaluation method was fair and could motivate them to work harder.

Industry strongly advocates inclusion of teamwork in the curriculum and teamwork is a requirement for ABET accreditation. Unfortunately most engineering and computer science programs fail to address teamwork as something that needs to be taught. It is usually expected that students should learn teamwork skills on their own, through participation in various team projects. Little thought or effort is given as to how to improve the way teaching is done in order to improve students' abilities to function on teams. One reason for this is that teaching teamwork demands a good deal of time and effort from the faculty. This is especially the case when teamwork is incorporated in regular lecture-discussion classes, rather than classes dealing with capstone projects. The result is that students often do not learn the critical teamwork skills such as: communication, planning and tracking, collaborative design, and peer reviews. We have developed an approach for teaching effective teamwork skills utilizing Yahoo Groups along with a Learning Management System (LMS), such as Moodle. Our approach improves student learning of teamwork skills by assuring that effective communication and team collaboration develops among all team members. Instructors are able to teach teamwork skills without having to devote a great deal of extra time and effort.

As a result, many institutions are adopting group learning as an alternative to traditional methods. However, there are still many challenges facing students learning in groups. These include lack of leadership, time and scheduling of workload, free riding, individual and social barriers, lack of team development, lack of motivation and social loafing. The integration of the mobile context and technologies in group learning can assist in minimizing some of these barriers. Information Communication Technologies (ICTs) are believed to bring a transformation on teaching and learning processes through the facilitation of communication and interaction among teachers and learners. Researchers have also found that tacit knowledge has much greater importance to industry and academia. For instance, it allows individuals to achieve goals they personally value. It can be used to measure or predict job performance and those possessing it have been found to manage themselves and others better. This study investigates the extent to which students share tacit knowledge using the mobile phone in group projects and examines if they achieve better performance. One hundred and fifty (150) undergraduate students from different disciplines participated in the survey. The results show that not many students share tacit knowledge using mobile technology. Students in Information Systems (IS) shared relatively more tacit knowledge than those in the Computer Science (CS), Civil Engineering (CE) and Psychology (PSY) disciplines. They mainly shared practical experience on using presentation and project planning tools, web design applications or Microsoft Office. (CE) students shared the least of tacit knowledge using mobile technology. In addition, we discovered that students who share more tacit knowledge perform much better in group projects i.e., students in the IS discipline performed well. We also conducted tests to establish whether discipline has an effect on sharing of tacit knowledge. It was discovered that discipline may influence sharing of knowledge types e.g., TK1 (discuss project tasks and allocation of responsibilities) and TK2 (theoretical knowledge) and not TK3 (seeking clarification from Professors). Thus, the lack of tacit knowledge sharing observed in non-(IS) disciplines can be attributed to factors other than the nature of the discipline. Copyright © 2011 ACM.",,"ACM Int. Conf. Proc.

On the one hand, there are tools that can be used for the creation of design solutions and only some of them facilitate the co-edition. However, they do not incorporate mechanisms that support the sharing of the designs between teachers. On the other hand, there are tools that serve as repositories of educational resources but they do not enable the authoring of the designs. In this paper we present LdShake, a web tool whose novelty is focused on the combined support for the social sharing and co-edition of learning design solutions within communities of teachers. Teachers can create and share learning designs with other teachers using different access rights so that they can read, comment or co-edit the designs. Therefore, each design solution is associated to a group of teachers able to work on its definition, and another group that can only see the design. The tool is generic in that it allows the creation of designs based on any pedagogical approach. However, it can be particularized in instances providing pre-formatted designs structured according to a specific didactic method (such as Problem-Based Learning, PBL). A particularized LdShake instance has been used in the context of Human Biology studies where teams of teachers are required to work together in the design of PBL solutions. A controlled user study, that compares the use of a generic LdShake and a Moodle system, configured to enable the creation and sharing of designs, has been also carried out. The combined results of the real and controlled studies show that the social structure, and the commenting, co-edition and publishing features of LdShake provide a useful, effective and usable approach for facilitating teachers' teamwork. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

One aspect of this is to ensure that students, along with professional skills, possess personal skills such as communication, teamwork, and presentation skills. At the same time, many faculty members note that at the beginning of education freshmen students have a low level of self-confidence, lack of communication skills, and teamwork experience. The introductory part of the Computer Engineering curriculum contains one or two courses which can improve students' communication skills. These courses are Technical Writings or Technical English. Usually these courses are given by English language instructors in a traditional way and communication skills are not in practical use on an introductory level. Purpose: The main purpose of the study is to develop a new approach for integrating Technical English courses into computer engineering curriculum. Such integration has to increase students' involvement into project design (team work) from the very beginning of education, increase motivation to study technical English, improve language knowledge, and increase students' self-confidence and communication skills. Method: As a research method we have applied the Project-Based Learning approach for the Technical English course. The project we suggested to freshman students is a Student Conference, which they have to organize and host by themselves. During the project, every student has to play three different roles: to participate in organizing and hosting the conference, to write and present a research paper, and to review submitted research apers. These roles support the students to improve team working, project management, research, and written and oral communication skills. Dealing with topics from the popular subjects of computer engineering area, the Student Conference bridges the gap between engineering courses and technical writing. Six different committees were formed by the students: Advisory Board, Program Committee, Conference Chairs, Organization Committee, Publishing Group, and the Technical Support Group. During the semester, the members of the Advisory Board gave lectures on project/conference management, research methods, plagiarism, and presentation techniques as well as on advanced English grammar. At the end of the project, a one day conference was hosted by students where they presented their posters and released conference proceedings. Findings and Results: As a project, the Student Conference has allowed Computer Engineering students to be involved in a real life project. The students engaged in activities that develop and foster the use of learning strategies such as goal setting, planning, self-evaluation, confidence, and risk-taking. The language knowledge of students has been increased, and they were introduced to technical writing methods. However, by this project, technical writings became a tool for knowledge of a topic of choice rather than the focus of study. Conclusions and Recommendations: Because this project was by nature multi-dimensional, it lends itself well to evaluate multiple outcomes. Within our framework we have included three sources of assessment: instructors, peers, and students. All of them have shown the increasing level of satisfaction among students and instructors. This approach can be used for integrating social elective courses into engineering curricula on all levels of university education.",,"Egitim Arastirmalari Eurasian J. Educ.

This work is an outcome of an NSF funded project called CAPSULE (Capstone Unique Learning Experience). We use the top-down pedagogical approach instead of the traditional bottom-up approach. The top-down approach relates the abstract concepts to exciting open-ended capstone projects where students are engaged in designing solutions, like products to solve open-ended problems. This top-down approach is modeled after the college-level capstone design courses. The paper presents the model, its details, and implementation. It also presents the formative and summative evaluation of the model after deploying it in the Boston Public Schools, a system heavily populated by the targeted student groups.

However, there are noticeable gaps in the literature with respect to understanding how the formulation of design problems and establishment of requirements affect the final design solution in undergraduate design education. This paper is an initial step to understand the influence of level of detail of problem statement and requirements on the level of detail of final solution in capstone design projects. In doing so, a document analysis of final reports from capstone design class collected over a period of ten years, 1999 to 2008, is conducted. A data compression approach is developed to allow for the mapping of level of detail of problem statement and requirements to the level of detail of final solution. The findings of this research indicate that a low level of detail problem statement and requirements leads to no greater than a medium level of detail in the final solution. A high level of detail of final solution is more likely to result from either a high or medium level of detail of problem statement and requirements. Additionally, it was found that a high level of detail final solution is more likely to result in a high percentage of requirements satisfied. These findings are used to make several recommendations to improve the level of detail of the problem statement and requirements so a high level of detail final solution is developed while satisfying a great number of requirements. This assists in ensuring that students possess the skills needed before entering the professional workforce. Copyright © 2011 by ASME.",,"Proc. ASME Des. Eng. Tech.

The goal of each project team was to design, build, and demonstrate a two-channel bioamplifier that is functionally similar to a commercial bioamplifier used in the KSU AP 773 - Bioinstrumentation Laboratory course taken by some of these students. Assessment of the experience was provided via a post-project survey that addressed eight learning objectives, learning in 23 technical areas, project administration, and the overall experience.

Many successful cases of peer-to-peer models of organization arise and assume leading positions in world economy replacing, in many cases, the traditional hierarchical organization. People are evolving and interacting within heterogeneous teams composed by members from many different cultural groups and with distinct skills and backgrounds. Modern economy requires engineers to excel in collaborative and communication skills at an international setting. However, these competences are not usually addressed in most engineering curricula. We believe that in such a demanding and culturally diverse environment as the labour market is today, it is essential to promote team work and communication skills at an international and intercultural level. In the Multinational Undergraduate Team Work course, MUTW, students develop their capstone project as members of an international team while working at their home institutions. MUTW projects are to be developed by teams of final-year-undergraduate students from a multinational group of higher education institutions working to solve some engineering problem. Team members are geographically spread to assure heterogeneous teams and to promote international cooperation. This paradigm can be applied in any project/internship course unit. The results from the first edition are very encouraging supporting our initial hypothesis that MUTW significantly promotes students soft skills without requiring any change to prior degree curricula. © 2011 IEEE.",,"Int.

In online open and distant learning, group work is a commonly used strategy, given its collaborative nature and constructivist framework (Bates & Poole, 2003; Garrison & Anderson, 2003; Jonassen, 2005). In this context, collaborative learning processes are highly dependent on the shared written information and the interactions that are established among the participants. The types of interactions that occur within such groups can influence their knowledge convergence processes, and are often decisive for its success. In this paper we aim to study the different types of collaborative practices in online Courses based on the analysis of the online interactions on the discussion forums, the works produced by the students (both individually and in small groups), and answers to questionnaires applied in the different stages of the investigation. In this particular case we are interested in exploring questions related to the process of knowledge convergence during online group work in Open and Distance Learning. Data analysis involved iterative analysis and revision of the coding scheme. Two of the researchers derived the initial coding key from the online discussion forums used during the group project phase of the Curricular Unit. Some of the codes were quantified in order to foster a more meaningful comparison of the data by allowing patterns to be identified and further explored (McConnell, 2006). In this study, it became clear that the more and less successful groups, in terms of their outcome or product, clearly revealed distinctive patterns of work, characterized by negotiation, research, conception and production. Moreover, particular patterns of work make decisive contributions for the participants' shared knowledge and knowledge convergence. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

The students had to learn about each technique through discussion, modeling, and moderated practice. We focused on this process learning and trusted that the technical material would come from solving the (unspecified) assignments. This focus left no time for traditional teaching activities.

Unlike in medical education, which is more easily adaptable to PBL, implementing PBL in engineering courses in the traditional semester system set-up is challenging. While PBL is normally implemented in small groups of up to ten students with a dedicated tutor during PBL sessions in medical education, this is not plausible in engineering education because of the high enrollment and large class sizes. In a typical engineering course, implementation of PBL consisting of students in small groups in medium to large classes is more practical. However, this type of implementation is more difficult to monitor, and thus requires good support and guidance in ensuring commitment and accountability of each student towards learning in his/her group. To provide the required support, Cooperative Learning (CL) is identified to have the much needed elements to develop the small student groups to functional learning teams. Combining both CL and PBL results in a Cooperative Problem-Based Learning (CPBL) model that provides a step by step guide for students to go through the PBL cycle in their teams, according to CL principles. Suitable for implementation in medium to large classes (approximately 40-60 students for one floating facilitator), with small groups consisting of 3-5 students, the CPBL model is designed to develop the students in the whole class into a learning community. This paper provides a detailed description of the CPBL model.

The problem- based learning (PBL) is a learning theory that emphasizes collaboration and teamwork to solve a problem. However, a problem that occurs frequently in the implementation of PBL is the out-of-context conversation, which is a situation in which the students lose focus and start talking about topics that are not related to the discussion. In presential learning, the teacher can easily detect this problem and try to avoid it in order to improve the learning process. In distance learning, however, detecting this problem is not a trivial task. That is mostly due to issues related to the students' geographic distribution and the lack of information regarding their motivation. Another noteworthy aspect is the creation of workgroups. In PBL, the members of a workgroup that is responsible for solving a problem must have certain complementary knowledge and skills related to the problem, and it might be difficult for the facilitator to assign students to workgroups, since the lack of presential contact makes it difficult to perceive important characteristics of the students' profiles. Then, this paper presents an agent-based architecture for detecting out-of-context conversation and for helping in the creation of workgroups on the PBL. © 2011 ACM.",,"Proc ACM Symp Appl Computing",Conference Paper,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-79959292203

This article investigates group learning and creative processes that impact the efficacy of early team interactions, and the impact of those interactions on the generation of integrated conceptual frameworks from which co-created research problems may emerge. Relevant learning and creativity theories were used to design a management intervention that was applied within the context of an incipient eScience team.

Among many schools' SE curricula, senior projects serve as a capstone course that provides comprehensive training in collaborative project development. With the focus on collaboration training, instructors of senior projects often address issues that include how to encourage collaboration and ensure that collaborative efforts are sustained throughout the project's development. In order to help resolve these issues, the MFS takes a holistic approach. The meetings-flow concept that undergirds the MFS introduces a novel macro-level and meeting-oriented group process to guide the proceeding of the project's collaborative work. The design of the MFS facilitates a computerized environment that helps to institutionalize and monitor such a group process. In introducing the MFS, we focus initially on the elaboration of the concept and design, after which we present and validate the system implementation and usage. We also evaluate the MFS and receive a positive result with respect to the educational issues raised in this paper.

The research was conducted with a sample of 34 students in the third year of a Computer Engineering degree, which, during a period of 15 weeks, required them to design and implement an innovative distributed application project. The procedure consisted of the implementation of the eight phases of the TASC method integrated to the Wikideas and Creativity Connector tools. The information provided by the tools, interviews and questionnaires administered to students were used to analyze our hypothesis. The results show that the tools helped the students to generate, evaluate and select the most relevant ideas and to form teams for project execution. They also revealed that teams with high indexes of creativity and affinity (type α) achieved the best grades in academic performance and project originality. Furthermore, research data show that Wikideas and Creativity Connector along with the TASC approach created a positive classroom climate for students.

With over 40% of the total U.S. energy usage servicing the operation of commercial and residential buildings, this trend is well founded. Recent surveys of the industry indicate that within 4 to 5years, a vast majority of engineering firms expect their business will be significantly dedicated to green building designs. In contrast, current academic institutions are not well positioned to prepare young engineers for this challenge, and current faculty are not well trained in the tenets of sustainability or the roles of engineers in this movement. Change must occur if the engineering and design professions are to remain relevant and responsive to societal needs. To accommodate this challenge, the writers have designed and implemented the Integrated Design Experience (IDeX), a capstone course in which undergraduate and graduate students interact with faculty and practitioners on real projects with challenging needs in sustainability. The course is designed to provide an actual and virtual space for the multitude of disciplines to interact on real designs to foster both improved research and outreach efforts. Expected outcomes from the course include both student and faculty learning on the methods and value of sustainable design as well as the development of an interdisciplinary network of faculty and practitioners involved in sustainable design. Learning is being evaluated using a continuous authentic assessment of design products. First-year results indicate that students learned interdisciplinary teamwork and communication skills, and they see substantial value in the authentic design experience. In future years, the development of the interdisciplinary network will be tracked by using social networking tools and by assessing faculty attitudes toward involvement in IDeX. Both metrics will be investigated using the diffusions of innovation framework. The combined evaluation will lead to an in-depth understanding of how the IDeX model can be scaled and replicated at other institutions. © 2011 American Society of Civil Engineers.",,"J Prof Issues Eng Educ Pract",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-79955549547

For the most part, our results are consistent with expectations. That is, males, or more specifically those with greater confidence in their technical skills, are more likely to prefer working alone on difficult tasks or tasks in which the needed information is spread across several sources (e.g.; the Internet, journals, and books). When asked about a generic project, however, the results contradicted expectations, indicating that women are more likely to prefer working alone. More importantly, the data suggest that confidence in Internet skills also plays a role in explaining this counter-intuitive result.

Benefits include early detection of internal team difficulties, an effective system for documenting individual contributions in team contexts, and a strong mechanism for differentiating student grades based on individual performance.

The course was transformed from a lecture-based course to a project-based course, integrating a semester-long project as a stimulus for students' learning. To evaluate and compare students' learning between the lecture-based and project-based teaching approaches, the LITEE survey instrument (http://www.litee.org/site) was used. The survey instrument includes five constructs to measure five different aspects of students learning: higherorder cognitive skills, self-efficacy, ease of learning subject matter, teamwork, and communication skills. The survey on pre-assessment and post-assessment of student learning outcomes was conducted to determine the effectiveness of the project-based approach on enhancing students' learning outcomes. The results show that the use of the project-based approach significantly improved students' ease of learning the subject matter. Project based learning could be used as an effective teaching and learning strategy by educators to facilitate students' learning. © 2011 American Society for Engineering Education.","American Society for Engineering Education","ASEE Annu.

We define resource-constrained environments to refer to a range of conditions, including material issues such as limited electricity as well as societal conditions such as low literate populations. Resource-constrained environments provide unique infrastructure, technical, and social constraints that demand innovative design approaches. The course described in this paper built upon previous, similar classes by bringing together interdisciplinary teams of students primarily from the departments of computer science and engineering and human centered design and engineering, who conducted fieldwork with potential user populations to identify a pressing problem, designed a technology to solve that community-based problem, implemented a solution, and evaluated that solution. Students worked on projects with real-world impact and gained valuable experience with multidisciplinary design and multidisciplinary team work. Both sides gained greater appreciation of the difficulties faced by their peers - that fieldwork and software development are both often unpredictable and challenging. Part of the course goal was to provide students with difficult enough collaborations that they would be introduced to the complexity of the workplace, an element of instruction that is often difficult to achieve. In this paper we describe the class format, sample projects, and course outcomes based on student projects and survey responses.

Student's learning outcomes are greatly impacted by these teaching and learning methods. It is hypothesized that properly selected teaching and learning methods can be applied in student's learning and knowledge development to help students with different culture backgrounds yield better learning outcomes. This research study selects three teaching and learning methods for an experiment in a software engineering class. These methods are tightening connections between learning objectives and outcomes, a repetitive learning model to improve student learning results, and a new measurement for student team project. A hypothesis testing is designed to verify effectiveness of these methods in developing student's learning outcomes. An experiment was conducted in two software engineering project management classes with a group of seventy Chinese engineering students. Main purpose of the experiment is to test a hypothesis - whether or not the three newly modified teaching and learning methods can significantly improve student's learning outcomes. Sample data is collected from the experiment and is then analyzed by proper statistical methods. Statistical analysis of a small sample of data helps accept the original hypothesis.

The subjects collaboratively solved an analysis and design problem in a graduate engineering course. In previous experiments, we showed the benefits of the CCM in improving engineering team performance and investigated the mechanisms that facilitate this improvement. The CCM is a six-stage cognitive model that takes into consideration the cognitive and social activities that occur during collaborative problem solving by facilitating problem formulation, solution planning, and system design tasks during collaboration. While facilitating collaboration within teams has long been seen as advantageous, the CCM model prescribes tactics to employ to ensure that collaboration is effective. In the first two experiments we showed the use of the CCM created a better understanding within the team of the problem they were tackling, and thus improved the project outcomes for that team. In the third experiment we sought to identify why those teams using the CCM performed better, hypothesizing that the CCM facilitates the forming of a shared, or team, mental model which has been identified, in the extant literature, as a necessary factor in high-performing teams. In this fourth experiment, randomly assigned teams of students were presented with one of four design problems. Half the teams were then exposed to the CCM. The effect on student learning was measured via a sequence of five individual assignments and exams as well as overall grades that incorporated the team projects. The results indicate that the CCM does indeed improve student learning. © 2011 American Society for Engineering Education.","American Society for Engineering Education","ASEE Annu. Conf. Expos. Conf.

The paper makes a contribution to the literature since there are few empirical studies examining students' perceptions of capstone subjects and none, to our knowledge, focusing on employability skills. Our study suggests that students believed the capstone subject did improve a broad range of employability skills and it also demonstrates the interrelated nature of these skills. We conjecture that the team-based, real-client model of capstone is particularly useful, compared to other capstone models, because it is especially effective at integrating the range of employability skills such as teamwork, communication, problem solving and self-management.","Higher Education Academy","ITALICS Innov.

Teamwork skills are particularly necessary for professionals in the engineering fields where diverse groups must work together to solve complex problems. But how and in what context can those skills be taught? Once taught, how can these skills be assessed and how can faculty provide objective feedback to students when teamwork is often conducted outside the classroom? Based on the work of Patrick Lencioni and other leading authorities on teaming and organizational psychology, University of Houston - Downtown has developed a curriculum designed to teach students to be both good team members and to provide the internal team leadership needed to resolve common behaviors within dysfunctional teams. While no new theoretical results on teamwork are presented, the authors have focused instead on applying their experience as managers of teams in major corporations and institutions of higher education to explore what an effective teaming curriculum might include and to develop related assessment tools. This paper outlines a strategy for integrating deliberate teaming instruction into senior-level engineering capstone or project courses.

The findings of the interviews showed that although students collaborated and cooperated together to do the task, they favoured cooperative over collaborative learning.

Increasingly, engineering students are seeing the integration of communication, teamwork, leadership, and ethics into their engineering curriculum. The best models are those that couple these professional skills with actual engineering projects to show students how intricately linked communication and teamwork skills are with engineering problem solving and design. Much emphasis is placed on senior capstone courses, as this meets the immediate demand of preparing graduating seniors for the non-technical aspects of their careers. In contrast, freshman classes receive less attention in terms of their position to ""set the tone"" for the coupling of communication and engineering, likely because the demands placed on freshman engineering classes are already high. They serve as a recruitment tool, pique interest in engineering, expose students to the many and varied areas of concentration in the discipline, and perhaps, introduce students to engineering projects and basic design skills. While the many and varied objectives of freshman classes already challenge the curriculum, increasing enrollment is another constraint. Unusually large freshman classes make intensive speaking and writing opportunities challenging in terms of evaluation and feedback. We have successfully integrated communication and interpersonal skill development into the freshman civil engineering class for several years. Despite many years of success with this course, we faced a unique challenge this year when enrollment increased by almost fifty percent. This increased number of students threatened to disrupt our already intensive instruction and evaluation processes. Our purpose in this paper is to showcase our unique approach to team teaching, illustrate the individualized attention students receive on their writing, speaking, and teamwork assignments, and provide an assessment of our approach. Specifically, we highlight our model of team teaching, and show how we capitalize on a unique class structure to allow for individualized communication experiences and feedback for all 100 students. Finally, we assess our efforts through gathering student feedback in the form of surveys, evaluating students' speaking and writing competence, and gathering feedback from the instructional team to guide continuous improvement in the course. © 2011 American Society for Engineering Education.","American Society for Engineering Education","ASEE Annu.

Teamwork and soft skills are especially important in software engineering and computer programming, where projects are general too strenuous for individuals to accomplish and effective teamwork is vital for efficient completion of the projects. However, these soft skills, such as collaboration, communication ability, expressing power, speaking ability, sociocultural, independent responsibilities and collision resolution, are just very difficult to teach and learn because of the students' passive role in traditional course. The PTBL learning model combines with Web3D technologies to augment the teamwork skills in software engineering. The PTBL model which is based on Problem-Based Learning and Task-Based Learning has been targeted to overcome common limitations of the traditional course for soft skills. This paper also presents two course based on the PTBL learning model, as well as the experimental results obtained from the courses of the two case studies in software engineering course. © 2010 IEEE.",,"Proc.

Two of these courses include the first semester course Sustainable Engineering Practice and the second semester course Engineering Design and Innovation. Both courses are targeted at the development of professional practice skills such as communication and teamwork. In these courses ePortfolios are used to help students develop their reflective practice through reflection on learning and reflection/evaluation on individual contribution to group projects. To create the ePortfolios several online assessment methods have been trialed including wikis, blogs, and the ePortfolio program PebblePad. A survey of students computer literacy conducted in 2009 found that students are comfortable with working in this online environment; however their experience is very dependent on what tool is selected, how it is used, and the training provided. Students found the online tools a fresh alternative to traditional assessment methods, however many students were frustrated by the technology and would prefer to focus on learning the subject rather than learning new software. This paper will consider some strengths and weaknesses of the on-line pedagogy and explore why online assessment is not necessarily quick and easy for students or staff. © 2009 Smith E. J.",,"Eng.

However, previous studies of online project-based learning have focused primarily on the dynamics of online collaboration; students' knowledge construction throughout this process has not been examined thoroughly. This case study analyzed the relationship between students' levels of knowledge construction during asynchronous online discussions with respect to engagement in project-based learning. Graduate students' online postings in a course that comprised both project-based and non-project learning activities were coded and counted for knowledge construction, teaching, and social interaction moves using computer-mediated discourse analysis. Chi-square analyses found that the instructor's teaching discourse remained fairly consistent during project-based and non-project learning. Despite this, students' online discussions during project-based learning were characterized by more advanced levels of knowledge construction, where ideas were rationalized and integrated into plausible solutions. In contrast, students' online postings outside project-based learning rarely moved beyond the lower levels of information sharing and idea exploration. Based on these results, guidelines for designing and facilitating online project-based learning are presented and discussed. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.

This study has been carried out at the Universidad Politécnica de Madrid, where these methodologies have been applied to the Operating Systems I subject of the degree in Technical Engineering in Computer Systems. The fundamental hypothesis tested was whether the implementation of active learning methodologies (cooperative learning and problem based learning) favours the achievement of certain generic competences ('teamwork' and 'planning and time management') and also whether this fact improved the academic performance of our students. The original approach of this work consists in using psychometric tests to measure the degree of acquired student's generic competences instead of using opinion surveys, as usual. Results indicated that active learning methodologies improve the academic performance when compared to the traditional lecture/discussion method, according to the success rate obtained. These methods seem to have as well an effect on the teamwork competence (the perception of the behaviour of the other members in the group) but not on the perception of each students' behaviour.

The research team developed four major learning objectives for cross-disciplinary team learning (CDTL) based on a theory-driven framework for CDTL. The purpose of the study is to better understand students' self-efficacy for four CDTL objectives developed for project-based design team environments. Initial survey measures of pre-post project confidence levels across these dimensions have been developed and piloted in Fall '09 semester and all partner programs have been invited to pilot these measures in the Spring '10 semester. Preliminary data shows that students' understanding of cross-disciplinary team learning was influenced by their prior experience working on multi-disciplinary teams, as well as their disciplinary and design knowledge. Finally, student reflections suggest that engagement in deep design discussions has an important integrating role relative to CDTL in project-based environments. © 2010 IEEE.",,"Proc. Front. Educ.

This models the situation in many commercial sectors where work is increasingly being conducted across time zones and between multiple teams. Collaboration in these geographically distributed teams is virtual rather than through face-to-face interactions. The paper investigates how a virtual world such as Second Life compares to other collaboration tools such as instant messaging or Skype; and the challenges that students experience in becoming acquainted with and working in Second Life. Design/methodology/approach – The paper has employed a qualitative research methodology involving data collection through group interviews, epistolary (email) interviews and semi-structured individual interviews. The data have been analysed by applying the inductive analysis technique. Findings – The analysis is presented through answers to questions which educators may have about the effectiveness of virtual worlds in supporting collaboration in virtual teams. Research limitations/implications – The paper highlights the pedagogical role of 3D virtual worlds in supporting communication, team working and community building. The methodology will be of interest to researchers in the area of virtual worlds as there is little guidance in the literature about how to evaluate student experiences of these environments. Practical implications – The research reported in this paper is timely and significant in view of current business scenarios such as the challenges of a globally distributed work-place, the need to offer training to develop employees' skills of working in distributed environments and to meet changing market needs. Furthermore, the research will support the development of a coordinated response to the Leitch review of skills in the UK, which identified issues of resource-intensive travel, global warming and the need for businesses to be seen as “green” for customer attraction and retention. Originality/value – The paper discusses the role of 3D virtual worlds in supporting student team projects involving students who are geographically dispersed. The sense of visual presence and of place in a 3D world can make socialising in a virtual world, a more “human” experience than in 2D environments such as web sites, e-mail, wikis and blogs, and even phone or video-conferencing. The research reported in this paper could enhance uptake of 3D virtual worlds by organisations facing the challenges of facilitating socialisation and knowledge sharing in a distributed workforce. © 2010, Emerald Group Publishing Limited",,"Interact.

Space technology by itself is an interdisciplinary science, is costly, and developing at a fast pace. Moreover, a fruitful education system needs to remain dynamic if the quality of education is the main concern, making it a complicated system. This paper makes use of the System Engineering Approach and the experiences of developed countries in this area while incorporating the needs of the developing countries to devise a comprehensive program in space engineering at the Master's level. The needs of the developing countries as regards space technology education may broadly be put into two categories: to raise their knowledge of space technology which requires hard work and teamwork skills, and to transfer and domesticate space technology while minimizing the costs and maximizing its effectiveness. The requirements of such space education system, which include research facilities, courses, and student projects are then defined using a model drawn from the space education systems in universities in North America and Europe that has been modified to include the above-mentioned needs. Three design concepts have been considered and synthesized through functional analysis. The first one is Modular and Detail Study which helps students specialize in a particular area in space technology. Second is referred to as Integrated and Interdisciplinary Study which focuses on understanding and development of space systems. Finally, the third concept which has been chosen for the purpose of this study, is a combination of the other two, categorizing the required curriculum into seven modules, setting aside space applications. This helps students to not only specialize in one of these modules but also to get hands-on experience in a real space project through participation in summer group projects and also working in space systems laboratories or choose and write a thesis based on experiences gained through an internship program. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

To achieve this purpose, PjBL was implemented with online group activities in an undergraduate course. Social network analysis (SNA) and content analysis were employed to analyze online interaction during project work. According to the SNA results generated from the online discussion boards, the group cohesiveness of seven teams, indicated by density indices, varied considerably, from as low as 9.81 to as high as 30.00. Regarding the content analysis of two teams with high project scores (Teams F and G), team members not only shared information (Phase I), but also identified the areas of disagreement and clarified the goals and strategies (Phase II). They also conducted some negotiations (Phase III). However, team members with low project scores (Teams C and E) shared information and stated their opinions in most cases (Phase I), with not much social construction in the higher level. Although both Team C and G showed high level of group cohesiveness among the seven teams, it is notable that the high-performing Team G dedicated nearly 39.3 percent of online discussion to negotiating and co-constructing knowledge, contrary to the 5.9 percent of low-performing Team C.

Most computational tools supporting the assignment of students to class project groups use some general criterion, for instance, maximizing the diversity of the group members. However, frequently, the instructor needs to consider additional context-specific criteria and preferences which force the instructor to figure out the assignment of the students by hand instead of using a software tool. Difficult and time-consuming, this task can easily result in suboptimal assignments.

Findings: The analysis reveals six types of moral conflicts. Students face conflicts related to their work tasks and to human and outside parties, and inherent in them is an inclination to moral failure in terms of doing something they perceive to be morally wrong, and also the desire for moral success in resolving the conflicts as well as possible. Students practicing the project manager's job confronted the most difficult moral conflicts. Practical implications: The just IS student project community is suggested as a way of integrating ethics into IS education, and extending the research on moral conflicts to the business context is recommended. Originality/value: The paper offers two contributions. First, it develops the research on IS and project-based learning (PjBL) from a moral perspective and second, it facilitates ethics integration into IS education in the PjBL context. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.",,"Inf.

Because of its multi-disciplinary, design-centered nature, the field of Biomedical Engineering can play an important role in meeting this challenge. This article describes a new program at Rice University to give undergraduate students from all disciplines a broad background in bioengineering and global health and provides an initial assessment of program impact. Working in partnership with health care providers in developing countries, students in the Beyond Traditional Borders (BTB) initiative learn about health challenges of the poor and put this knowledge to work immediately, using the engineering design process as a framework to formulate solutions to complex global health challenges. Beginning with a freshman design project and continuing through a capstone senior design course, the BTB curriculum uses challenges provided by partners in the developing world to teach students to integrate perspectives from multiple disciplines, and to develop leadership, communication, and teamwork skills. Exceptional students implement their designs under the guidance of clinicians through summer international internships. Since 2006, 333 students have designed more than 40 technologies and educational programs; 28 have been implemented in sub-Saharan Africa, Latin America, the Caribbean, southeast Asia, and the United States. More than 18,000 people have benefited from these designs. 95% of alumni who completed an international internship reported that participation in the program changed or strengthened their career plans to include a focus on global health medicine, research, and/or policy. Empowering students to use bioengineering design to address real problems is an effective way to teach the new generation of leaders needed to solve global health challenges. © 2010 The Author(s).",,"Ann Biomed Eng",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-77956784647

This involves outsourcing projects to third parties or offshoring development to divisions in remote locations. A popular approach when implementing these strategies is the establishment of virtual teams. The justification for embarking on this approach is to endeavor to leverage the potential benefits of labor arbitrage available between geographical locations. When implementing such a strategy organizations must recognize that virtual teams operate differently to collocated teams, therefore, they must be managed differently. These differences arise due to the complex and collaborative nature of information systems development and the impact distance introduces. Geographical, temporal, cultural, and linguistic distance all negatively impact on coordination, cooperation, communication, and visibility in the virtual team setting. In these circumstances, it needs to be recognized that the project management of a virtual team must be carried out in a different manner to that of a collocated team. Results from this research highlight six specific project management areas, which need to be addressed to facilitate successful virtual team operation. They are: Organizational Virtual Team Strategy, Risk Management, Infrastructure, Implementation of a Virtual Team Process, Team Structure and Organization, and Conflict Management. © 2010 The Brazilian Computer Society.",,"J.

There were one control group and one experimental group; namely, the PBL group. Pre-service teachers were randomly assigned to either one of the two groups: The PBL group (n = 12), who received physics instruction in accordance with the PBL format, or a control group (n = 13), who received physics instruction in line with traditional teaching methods. Data were collected via the pre and post administration of the Magnetism Test (MT), the Approaches to Learning Scale (ALS), and the Scale of Attitudes towards Physics (SAP). The results indicated that the problem-based learning method not only encouraged the students' deep approach to learning, but also improved interest (a component of attitude) towards the physics course.

We sought to evaluate the differences in medical school education between graduates from PBL-based and conventional curricula and to what extent these curricula fit job requirements. Methods. Graduates from all German medical schools who graduated between 1996 and 2002 were eligible for this study. Graduates self-assessed nine competencies as required at their day-to-day work and as taught in medical school on a 6-point Likert scale. Results were compared between graduates from a PBL-based curriculum (University Witten/Herdecke) and conventional curricula. Results: Three schools were excluded because of low response rates. Baseline demographics between graduates of the PBL-based curriculum (n = 101, 49% female) and the conventional curricula (n = 4720, 49% female) were similar. No major differences were observed regarding job requirements with priorities for ""Independent learning/working"" and ""Practical medical skills"". All competencies were rated to be better taught in PBL-based curriculum compared to the conventional curricula (all p < 0.001), except for ""Medical knowledge"" and ""Research competence"". Comparing competencies required at work and taught in medical school, PBL was associated with benefits in ""Interdisciplinary thinking"" (Δ + 0.88), ""Independent learning/working"" (Δ + 0.57), ""Psycho-social competence"" (Δ + 0.56), ""Teamwork"" (Δ + 0.39) and ""Problem-solving skills"" (Δ + 0.36), whereas ""Research competence"" (Δ - 1.23) and ""Business competence"" (Δ - 1.44) in the PBL-based curriculum needed improvement. Conclusion: Among medical graduates in Germany, PBL demonstrated benefits with regard to competencies which were highly required in the job of physicians.

In order to prepare aerospace engineering students to be more competitive in the aerospace workforce, Introduction to Software Engineering was developed at a the Pennsylvania State University in 2007. This senior-level course was designed to present software engineering concepts to aerospace students who have some background in computer programming, but no prior knowledge in software engineering. Students majoring in aerospace can select the software engineering course or an electrical engineering course as a requirement for the aerospace major in the eighth semester. In addition students can also take the course as an aerospace engineering elective or to fulfill requirements for minors in computational science or information science and technology. During the first two years, the course provided the materials based solely on lectures and talks from guest speakers. To provide a more real-world experience to students, a student team project was added to the course in the spring semester 2009, where they had to use the software engineering concepts. The pedagogical approach was to incorporate peer learning through teamwork that would involve the students in a problem-based learning experience. The team project was designed with three objectives: to provide hands-on experience in software engineering through the development of a relatively small software system, to simulate the real working environment in a large company by having the students in the class work together as a team, and to emphasize the communication and collaboration skills among small groups in the software development model which are crucial skills in developing large and complex software systems. The purpose of this paper is to describe the student team project including a discussion of how it improved the learning experiences of students and to share assessment data of student perceptions of working on a team. Preliminary findings indicate that participation in the team project increased the students' awareness of the importance of software engineering in the Aerospace industry.

Furthermore, capabilities in team work and understanding of business process management indicate additional assets for the graduates' working life. At the University of Applied Sciences Technikum Wien, Problem Based Learning (PBL) is implemented in several courses. The new idea is to use PBL in the technical oriented courses ""Database Design"" and ""Database Systems"" with the purpose to teach interdisciplinary topics. Of course the technical topics are covered but additionally nontechnical topics like business process management are covered. The paper shows in detail the use of PBL in the course programs of Computer Science and Business Informatics. And it points out the main ideas behind the concept to illustrate which role PBL can play in the area of interdisciplinary teaching.","International Institute of Informatics and Systemics, IIIS","ICSIT - Int.

Current approaches rely on human experts to classify and compare groups according to some prescribed categories, resulting in a laborious and error-prone process. To address some of these issues, the authors compared and evaluated two methods for analyzing content generated by student groups engaged in a software development project. A content analysis and semi-automated text classification methods were applied to the communication data from a global software student project involving students from the US, Panama, and Turkey. Both methods were evaluated in terms of the ability to predict team performance. Application of the communication analysis' methods revealed that high performing teams develop consistent patterns of communicating which can be contrasted to lower performing teams. © 2010 IEEE.","IEEE Computer Society","Proc. - Int.

Students were given the opportunity and technical means to collaborate, and staff could assess individual students' participation. However, the actual level of collaboration was less than hoped for, especially in early iterations of the unit. While the teaching staff are confident that, for the overall student cohort, collaborating online using a wiki is meeting the needs of most students, this is varied across the diverse cohort. To gain further insight into the internal machinations of student groups, selected students were invited to submit their experiences of their wiki project. This paper reports the personal stories of two off campus students, and compares the experiences described by our students with the teaching staff members' perceptions. The two students featured were selected not just for their articulate writing, but because their group experiences were quite different. Considering these students' experiences has allowed the teaching staff to reflect on how to better support our students during their group project.","Australasian Society for Computers in Learning in Tertiary Education (ASCILITE)","Australas.

Community based programs are presented as an integral part in the development of individuals at early ages. The paper focuses on Service Learning and Project Based Learning as powerful concepts in promoting education. It shows how students throughout these processes learn to deploy their academic knowledge to meet community needs, develop practical skills and build leadership qualities. It examines also how they sense civic responsibilities, develop team work spirit, share and pass knowledge through experimental learning. It touches on the roles of scholars and students in the context of project based learning and service learning applications. The experience of the University of Balamand (UOB) in Lebanon is presented in this paper as a supportive example. An innovative education technique is presented under the umbrella of an interdisciplinary project which succeeded in passing technological advances to younger generation through partnership between the University, a number of schools and the community. The collaborative work of several units at UOB is detailed to show a successful learning experience with students from the Faculty of Engineering at UOB. Results are highlighted at two levels (1) community service level and (2) educational level. The ""UOB recycles"" project, which aims at gathering recyclable material from the University and its surroundings, and the ""Community GIS"" which aims at developing experimental practices among students at the Geographic Information System (GIS) Centre at the University, will be presented jointly as a case study. The projection of the University on its community is illustrated to provide a good model which could be adopted to promote spatial awareness, environmental respect, recycling behaviour and team work spirit through Service Learning and Project Based Learning. It is hoped that the success of this learning experience will pave the way into expanding the project to engage more community partners and develop further experimental practices; hence enhancing the sense of citizenship and responsibility among youth and helping them become better elements in their society.","European Society for Engineering Education (SEFI)","Jt.

'Traditional work' means that the employee has an invariable package of tasks that he/she is responsible for. In 'project teams' members have common complex goals and there are a lot of parts of assignments that one is responsible for in the team. 'Project' means that there is a specific exercise that must be carried out in defined time and budget. The nature of work is dynamically changing and there is a new view of work in project groups. There are different antecedences and emphasises than in 'traditional work'. There is a lot of information, and information acquisition is not a problem, but one has to be very clever to structure the abounding information he/she gets. Due to technical development, it is possible to work at home and people do not need to go out to work every day. Working together with others has also become special: you may not know personally the persons you work together with, you may have only virtual contact with them. The goals and the conditions of project team work are really special and it is important to know because more and more project groups are appearing. There are project groups appearing in Hungary also. According to the ""Collectively for Workplaces of the Future"" Foundation's (""Közösen a Jövo Munkahelyeiért"" Alapítvány) competition in 2009 we began a research related to project works in Hungarian organizations. We tried to analyze project work as an atypical type of work and we tried to also analyze how it can be appropriate to make possibilities of labour market better and ensure flexible opportunities for organizations and individuals. We analyzed such Hungarian organizations, which have one or more project teams and we tried to reveal work psychological aspects of this type of work. © Periodica Polytechnica 2010.","Budapest University of Technology and Economics","Period Polytech Soc Manage Sci",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84857312169

This sequence helps develop professional skills identified in the ABET A-K criteria though project-based-learning. The Freshman Engineering Clinics are an introduction to the profession, teamwork, and measurements. The Sophomore Engineering Clinics provide an introduction to technical communication and engineering design principles, and in the Junior/Senior Engineering Clinics, students work in multidisciplinary teams on real research and design projects. Most Junior/Senior Engineering clinics are sponsored by companies, or federal or state government agencies. As a secondary objective, the Engineering Clinic supports entrepreneurship in engineering students. The College of Engineering has a long-standing program that allows students to apply for funding to pursue their own entrepreneurial ideas through the Junior/Senior Engineering Clinics. However, the program has been utilized by very few students. Recently, two new assignments- an entrepreneurial design project and a white paper- have been added to the Sophomore Engineering Clinic sequence. This paper describes these new assignments and discusses how entrepreneurship provides an excellent framework for meeting the main pedagogical objectives of the course: teaching technical communication and engineering design. It will also give an assessment of whether the new assignments have been effective in causing more students to pursue entrepreneurship in the Junior/Senior Engineering Clinic. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2010.","American Society for Engineering Education","ASEE Annu.

There seems to be little research related to how students can contribute in global, transparent wiki communities such as Wikipedia and Wikibooks. The purpose of this article is to argue that we need to extend our understanding of transparency as a pedagogical concept if we want to use these open, global wiki communities in an educational setting. By describing one wiki based course in detail, I argue that these kinds of radically transparent learning environments in tertiary education challenge traditional pedagogy and our ordinary perceptions of what a class and working assignment is. The course data in this article include a course description and teacher and student reflections on assessed group projects which produced ""student written, collaboratively edited textbooks"" on Wikibooks. Student perceptions indicate positive attitudes towards global learning environments, if the didactical design is carefully planned. In the article I suggest that ""outsiders"" and ""former and future students"" should be included as categories in a pedagogical definition of transparency. These categories represent a radical expansion of course space and course availability.","Australasian Society for Computers in Learning in Tertiary Education (ASCILITE)","Australas. J. Educ.

Effective professionals learn from experiences and use this knowledge when encountering similar or more complex problems. The engineering capstone design course provides an excellent opportunity for students to gain experience in design, but experience alone does not guarantee learning of skills and knowledge, or the ability to transfer this knowledge to new situations. Researchers and theorists have long trumpeted the value of reflective practice as a differentiating factor in the effectiveness of practitioners. As shown by the growing number of publications on the topic in engineering education literature, teaching students the process and value of reflection is increasingly recognized as an essential component of engineering design education. To support teaching and learning of reflection in engineering capstone design courses, this study seeks to understand how students reflect-individually and as a team-as they are engaged in a design project, specifically in relation to teamwork. This study is part of a larger NSF supported project engaged in the development of capstone design course assessment instruments. Therefore, a second aim is to examine the effectiveness of the instruments in facilitating student and team reflective practice. The research questions for this study include: (1) What are the teamwork-related reflective practices of engineering capstone design teams and individuals? (i.e., what teamwork issues do they reflect on; for what purposes; how; what factors affect reflection; and what are the outcomes?), and (2) What impacts do ""prompted"" (instructor assigned) reflective assessments have on a team's overall reflective practice? This qualitative study uses an analytic induction approach to analyzing data and for developing a model of student reflective practices, based on initial conceptual reflection models. Participants include members from two multidisciplinary design teams. Data collection methods include: (1) team meeting observations, (2) interviews (individual and team focus groups), and (3) review of student reflective assignments prompted by instructors. Data is being collected throughout the 2009-2010 academic year, spanning the complete project of each participating team. Results will be based on team reflective practices within the context of each of the three major design phases-problem scoping, concept development, and solution development. Additionally, the longitudinal aspects of the study allow for individual and team growth, regarding teamwork-reflection, to be analyzed and presented. Currently, data collection has begun for the first design phase, problem scoping, and this paper will present initial findings spanning this phase. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2010.","American Society for Engineering Education","ASEE Annu.
