Reflections of design-based research approach on learning experience of visual programming course;This study aims to examine the effects of Visual Programming course conducting in accordance with design-based research on students' learning experiences. The study was conducted in the fall semester in 2017-2018 at Software Engineering Department in Technology Faculty of a university in the north of Turkey. The sample of the study consists of 12 students taking the course. In this study based on a two-stage research method, the course was taught in accordance with design-based research for 14 weeks. Then the implications of teaching the course in that way for students’ visual programming learning experiences are analyzed with the specific case study. At the end of the study, the participants of the study were interviewed through a semi-structured interview form. The qualitative data obtained from the participants are subjected to content analysis. It is seen that students’ views can be grouped under five main themes. The results of the study show that the course process which is maintained in accordance with the design-based research method has important contributions for students learning experiences. It is concluded that the views of the students are generally positive but it can be said that there are also negative views about the process even if in limited numbers.;2385076517;;;Scholarly Journals;;"Özyurt, Hacer;Özcan Özyurt";;; © 2020.

Bridging sustainability science, earth science, and data science through interdisciplinary education;Given the rapid emergence of data science techniques in the sustainability sciences and the societal importance of many of these applications, there is an urgent need to prepare future scientists to be knowledgeable in both their chosen science domain and in data science. This article provides an overview of required competencies, educational programs and courses that are beginning to emerge, the challenges these pioneering programs face, and lessons learned by participating instructors, in the broader context of sustainability science competencies. In addition to data science competencies, competencies collaborating across disciplines are essential to enable sustainability scientists to work with data scientists. Programs and courses that target both sets of competencies—data science and interdisciplinary collaboration—will improve our workforce capacity to apply innovative new approaches to yield solutions to complex sustainability problems. Yet developing these competencies is difficult and most instructors are choosing instructional approaches through intuition or trial and error. Research is needed to develop effective pedagogies for these specific competencies.;2296991663;;;Scholarly Journals;" University of Texas at El Paso, Department of Geological Sciences, El Paso, USA (GRID:grid.267324.6) (ISNI:0000 0001 0668 0420) , Cooperative Institute for Research in the Atmosphere, Colorado State University, Fort Collins, USA (GRID:grid.47894.36) (ISNI:0000 0004 1936 8083); Colorado State University, Electrical and Computer Engineering, Fort Collins, USA (GRID:grid.47894.36) (ISNI:0000 0004 1936 8083) , University of Texas at Austin, Department of Curriculum and Instruction, Austin, USA (GRID:grid.89336.37) (ISNI:0000 0004 1936 9924) , Mathematics and Statistics, University of Vermont, Burlington, USA (GRID:grid.59062.38) (ISNI:0000 0004 1936 7689) , Texas Advanced Computing Center, University of Texas at Austin, Austin, USA (GRID:grid.89336.37) (ISNI:0000 0004 1936 9924)";"Pennington, Deana;Ebert-Uphoff Imme;Freed, Natalie;Martin, Jo;Pierce, Suzanne A";;; Sustainability Science is a copyright of Springer, (2019).

Applying Agile across the IT Curriculum;Agile is emerging as a new paradigm for organizations across a variety of industry sectors because Agile helps teams manage and adapt quickly to change. In order to provide our students with workforce ready skills and better performance in group projects, a regional campus Computer and Information Technology (CIT) department began implementing Agile across its curriculum. After a visit to a local business who underwent an Agile transformation and is now using Agile for all their teams, they said that understanding the culture of Agile is more important than the practices themselves. Revising our curriculum allows us to give our students the advantage of learning how to be Agile and what it means to thrive in an Agile culture.;2396852371; EJ1246230;;Scholarly Journals;;"Hulshult, Andrea;Woods, David M.";;;;;; Article , Report , 080: Journal Articles , 143: Reports - Research; 1545-679X;; Feb 2020;;;1; English; English;; 14-21;;Feb 2020;Information Systems Education Journal; Scholarly Journals , Reports;2020; http://isedj.org; ERIC, © Information Systems and Computing Academic Professionals;18;https://search.proquest.com/docview/2396852371?accountid=11774;;;;;;; 14;;  5185ER5 10713ER5  5168 10669 ,  3282ER5 10713ER5  3268 10669 ,  10719ER5  10675 ,  10685ER5 4527ER5 912ER5  10642 4511 909 ,  5611ER5 9726ER5 1ER5  5592 9690 1 ,  1305ER5 8652ER5  1300 8620 ,  8473ER5 1823ER5 9339ER5 5258ER5  8442 1814 9306 5241 ,  10709ER5  10666 ,  5723ER5 2799ER5  5704 2787 ,  8284ER5  8254 ,  2532ER5 3198ER5 2799ER5  2521 3184 2787 ,  10664ER5 3241ER5 6603ER5  10621 3227 6582 ,  2065ER5 5172ER5 8290ER5 3164ER5  2054 5155 8260 3150 ,  1783ER5 3795ER5 9280ER5 3431ER5 5722ER5 4925ER5 8950ER5 8043ER5 4558ER5 8297ER5  1774 3780 9247 3417 8016 4542 5703 4908 8917 8267 ,  10608ER5 9048ER5  10565 9015; Higher Education , Postsecondary Education;;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aeric&amp;atitle=Applying+Agile+across+the+IT+Curriculum&amp;title=Information+Systems+Education+Journal&amp;issn=1545-679X&amp;date=2020-02-01&amp;volume=18&amp;issue=1&amp;spage=14&amp;au=Hulshult%2C+Andrea%3BWoods%2C+David+M.&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=Information+Systems+Education+Journal&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/EJ1246230&amp;rft_id=info:doi/";Social Science Premium Collection
What distinguishes great software engineers?;Great software engineers are essential to the creation of great software. However, today, we lack an understanding of what distinguishes great engineers from ordinary ones. We address this knowledge gap by conducting one of the largest mixed-method studies of experienced engineers to date. We surveyed 1,926 expert engineers, including senior engineers, architects, and technical fellows, asking them to judge the importance of a comprehensive set of 54 attributes of great engineers. We then conducted 77 email interviews to interpret our findings and to understand the influence of contextual factors on the ratings. After synthesizing the findings, we believe that the top five distinguishing characteristics of great engineers are writing good code, adjusting behaviors to account for future value and costs, practicing informed decision-making, avoiding making others’ jobs harder, and learning continuously. We relate the findings to prior work, and discuss implications for researchers, practitioners, and educators.;2347101304;;;Scholarly Journals; Microsoft, Redmond, USA (GRID:grid.419815.0) (ISNI:0000 0001 2181 3404) , University of Washington, The Information School, Seattle, USA (GRID:grid.34477.33) (ISNI:0000000122986657) , Microsoft Research, Redmond, USA (GRID:grid.419815.0) (ISNI:0000 0001 2181 3404);"Luo, Li Paul;Ko, Amy J;Begel, Andrew";;; Empirical Software Engineering is a copyright of Springer, (2019).

The use of open data as a material for learning;Open data has potential value as a material for use in learning activities. However, approaches to harnessing this are not well understood or in mainstream use in education. In this research, early adopters from a diverse range of educational projects and teaching settings were interviewed to explore their rationale for using open data in teaching, how suitable activity designs could be achieved, and the practical challenges of using open data. A thematic analysis was conducted to identify patterns and relationships in these open data-based practices that have already emerged. A document analysis of teaching materials and other related artefacts was used to augment and validate the findings. Drawing on this, common approaches and issues are identified, and a conceptual framework to support greater use of open data by educators is described. This paper also highlights where existing concepts in education and educational technology research, including inquiry-based learning, authenticity, motivation, dialogue, and personalisation can help us to understand the value and challenges of using open data in education.;2282313378;;;Scholarly Journals; The Open University, Institute of Educational Technology, Learning and Teaching Innovation, Milton Keynes, UK (GRID:grid.10837.3d) (ISNI:0000000096069301);Coughlan, Tim;;; Educational Technology Research and Development is a copyright of Springer, (2019).

Development and Application of a Novel Engineering-Based Maker Education Course for Pre-Service Teachers;This study aimed to raise awareness of maker education for pre-service teachers and discuss maker education in their major subjects by developing and applying a maker education course for pre-service teachers with various majors based on novel engineering (NE), a teaching and learning method that combines humanities and engineering. Accordingly, the course was developed following the procedure of the Analysis, Design, Development, Implementation, and Evaluation (ADDIE) model, and the educational effectiveness was investigated using test tools. The educational effect and difficulties were also examined through the analysis of reflective journals written by 20 pre-service teachers with various majors who participated in the course. To investigate the educational effectiveness of the developed course, the science, technology, engineering, arts, and mathematics (STEAM) literacy of the participants—before and after the course—was measured, with the results demonstrating a statistically significant improvement. Analysis of the reflective journals identified a recognition of sharing effectiveness, the joy of making, and an in-depth understanding of maker education as education effects, and a lack of understanding of techniques, the burden of prototype fabrication, and the limitation of majoring subjects as difficulties experienced during the activities. This study verified that NE could be used as a significant maker education measure for pre-service teachers with various majors. Based on this verification, this study also proposes a strategy to develop more effective NE-based maker education.;2397362779;;;Scholarly Journals;;"Ji-Yun, Kim;Chung, Hyunsong;Eun Young Jung;Jin-Ok, Kim;Lee, Tae-Wuk";;; © 2020.

Teaching Natural Language Processing through Big Data Text Summarization with Problem-Based Learning;Natural language processing (NLP) covers a large number of topics and tasks related to data and information management, leading to a complex and challenging teaching process. Meanwhile, problem-based learning is a teaching technique specifically designed to motivate students to learn efficiently, work collaboratively, and communicate effectively. With this aim, we developed a problem-based learning course for both undergraduate and graduate students to teach NLP. We provided student teams with big data sets, basic guidelines, cloud computing resources, and other aids to help different teams in summarizing two types of big collections: Web pages related to events, and electronic theses and dissertations (ETDs). Student teams then deployed different libraries, tools, methods, and algorithms to solve the task of big data text summarization. Summarization is an ideal problem to address learning NLP since it involves all levels of linguistics, as well as many of the tools and techniques used by NLP practitioners. The evaluation results showed that all teams generated coherent and readable summaries. Many summaries were of high quality and accurately described their corresponding events or ETD chapters, and the teams produced them along with NLP pipelines in a single semester. Further, both undergraduate and graduate students gave statistically significant positive feedback, relative to other courses in the Department of Computer Science. Accordingly, we encourage educators in the data and information management field to use our approach or similar methods in their teaching and hope that other researchers will also use our data sets and synergistic solutions to approach the new and challenging tasks we addressed.;2384385480;;;Scholarly Journals; Department of Computer Science, Virginia Tech, VA 24061, USA , Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Virginia Tech, VA 24061, USA;"Li, Liuqing;Geissinger, Jack;Ingram, William A;Fox, Edward A";;; © 2020.

Exploring Which Agile Principles Students Internalize When Using a Kanban Process Methodology;This paper reports on a case study of the Agile Kanban project methodology, which while growing in popularity, has had far less analysis on its usefulness in the classroom as compared to other frameworks such as Agile Scrum. Our study provides insight into why the Kanban methodology is useful by mapping student comments about the methodology to the twelve principles laid down in the Agile Manifesto. Our analysis identified two key agile principles that help to explain the value of Kanban. Specifically, we found that the students focused on self-organizing teams and reflection at regular intervals, and that these two principles led to improved team communication and coordination. Our findings are useful for those looking to use or define a process management methodology for student teams as well as others exploring the more general challenge of incorporating agile into the classroom.;2374138509;;;Scholarly Journals;;"Saltz, Jeffrey;Heckman, Robert";;; Copyright EDSIG Winter 2020;;; Journal Article;;; Winter 2020;;1055-3096;1; English; English;; 51-60; West Lafayette;Winter 2020;Journal of Information Systems Education;;2020;;;31;https://search.proquest.com/docview/2374138509?accountid=11774;;;;;;; 51;; Teaching , Process management , Information systems , Software , Students , Classrooms , Project management , Methodology , Collaboration , Computer science , Teams , Classrooms , Communication , Mapping , Methods , Learning , Education , Principles , Students;;;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aabiglobal&amp;atitle=Exploring+Which+Agile+Principles+Students+Internalize+When+Using+a+Kanban+Process+Methodology&amp;title=Journal+of+Information+Systems+Education&amp;issn=10553096&amp;date=2020-01-01&amp;volume=31&amp;issue=1&amp;spage=51&amp;au=Saltz%2C+Jeffrey%3BHeckman%2C+Robert&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=Journal+of+Information+Systems+Education&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/";ProQuest Central,SciTech Premium Collection,Social Science Premium Collection
Blended learning in computing education: It’s here but does it work?;Blended learning, a combination of face-to-face and computer-assisted pedagogy, is gaining acceptance at universities as an alternative learning experience. Modern technology has given faculty new ways to incorporate active learning and increase student engagement in their courses. Although the broad history of technology-enhanced coursework has demonstrated that student learning is usually very comparable to what occurs in traditional coursework, recent studies focusing specifically on blended learning in totally redesigned classes report positive results. Were those positive results due to the online blending or to the redesign of the class? To answer this question and other limitations and challenges in past studies, the authors present their unique research that measures learning in a blended undergraduate management information systems course where identical classes were compared, one being all face-to-face and one being one-third online. By varying only course modality, this research answers the question of whether blended learning is a superior learning environment in an undergraduate MIS class, a second-level MIS class covering ERP, business processes, databases, advanced spreadsheets, and data analytics. Collecting both quantitative and qualitative data, the authors use a critical realism lens to create a mechanism for learning. Quantitative data, analyzed by multiple regression models and qualitative data, analyzed by content analysis lead to the outcome that learning is comparable to traditional coursework, grade-wise, but students prefer face-to-face class time. It also reveals that self-regulatory skills are evident, confirming that blended learning can aid in the construction of learning.;2220071385;;;Scholarly Journals; University of Delaware, Department of Accounting and MIS, Newark, USA (GRID:grid.33489.35) (ISNI:0000 0001 0454 4791)  , University of Delaware, Center for Teaching and Assessment of Learning, Newark, USA (GRID:grid.33489.35) (ISNI:0000 0001 0454 4791)  , University of Delaware, Center for Teaching and Assessment of Learning, Newark, USA (GRID:grid.33489.35) (ISNI:0000 0001 0454 4791)  , University of Delaware, Applied Economics and Statistics, Newark, USA (GRID:grid.33489.35) (ISNI:0000 0001 0454 4791) ;"Monk, Ellen F;Guidry, Kevin R;Langan, Pusecker Kathleen;Ilvento, Thomas W";;; Education and Information Technologies is a copyright of Springer, (2019).

The Importance of Soft Skills for Employability and Career Development: Students and Employers' Perspectives;Soft skills are important for seeking jobs as well as for a productive, successful and fulfilling career. The main objective of this study was to investigate students' perceptions of the importance of soft skills and their satisfaction with the level of skills possessed by them. In addition, the study also explored employers' expectations and satisfaction with the level of soft skills possessed by fresh graduates. Two questionnaires were used to collect data from students and employers. For the students' survey, 132 graduate students from Nanyang Technological University, Singapore participated in this study. In addition, 16 employers from different industries participated in the employers' survey. It was found that the students were well-aware of the importance of soft skills in their employability and career development. Soft skills considered important by them were positive attitude, oral communication, self-motivation and self-direction, and problem solving. On the other hand, the employers expected fresh graduates to possess skills related to positive attitude, teamwork, good ethics, and problem solving. However, the employers felt that fresh graduates usually possess less than satisfactory soft skills. The study suggests an integrated approach for teaching soft skills to students, where these skills should be embedded in the curriculum.;2330760547;;;Scholarly Journals; Associate Professor, Wee Kim Wee School of Communication & Information, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore , Post-Graduate Student, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore , Post-Graduate Student, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore , Post-Graduate Student, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore;"Majid, Shaheen;Eapen, Chithra Mary;Aung, Ei Mon;Oo, Khine Thazin";;; Copyright IUP Publications Dec 2019;;; Journal Article;;; Dec 2019;;0973-8479;4; English; English;; 7-39; Hyderabad;Dec 2019;IUP Journal of Soft Skills;;2019;;;13;https://search.proquest.com/docview/2330760547?accountid=11774;;;;;;; 7;; Problem solving , Collaboration , Success , Studies , Verbal communication , Employees , Decision making , Student attitudes , Career advancement , Teamwork , Career development planning , Critical thinking , Human capital , Employment , Professions , Employers , United States--US , Singapore;;;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aabiglobal&amp;atitle=The+Importance+of+Soft+Skills+for+Employability+and+Career+Development%3A+Students+and+Employers%27+Perspectives&amp;title=IUP+Journal+of+Soft+Skills&amp;issn=09738479&amp;date=2019-12-01&amp;volume=13&amp;issue=4&amp;spage=7&amp;au=Majid%2C+Shaheen%3BEapen%2C+Chithra+Mary%3BAung%2C+Ei+Mon%3BOo%2C+Khine+Thazin&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=IUP+Journal+of+Soft+Skills&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/";ProQuest Central
A Review of Nontraditional Teaching Methods: Flipped Classroom, Gamification, Case Study, Self-Learning, and Social Media;To optimize learners’ achievements, various nontraditional teaching methods have been introduced in the last two decades by multiple researchers and authors [17,18,19,20,21,22,23]. Since it is not possible for instructors to offer a tailor-made course for each learner in a classroom, many authors and researchers have made major efforts to determine a unique teaching method that would be effective for different types of learners Accordingly, as learners have different abilities and skills, it is not possible to find one unique method that is best for all learners [19,24]. According to the studies conducted by the authors of [99,100], adoption of the flipped classroom method positively affects students’ abilities to obtain needed skills and gain advanced knowledge belonging to the technical/professional category. [...]the main objectives of this study were to identify and categorize the advantages/benefits of the most studied nontraditional teaching methods (i.e., flipped classroom, gamification, case study, self-learning, and social media), and other nontraditional teaching methods were not studied. Conclusions Although there has been considerable growth in the number of researchers discussing the benefits of nontraditional teaching methods, no author or researcher has given a systematic overview and analysis. [...]this review aimed to encapsulate the current discussion regarding the benefits of the flipped classroom, gamification, case study, self-learning, and social media teaching methods, based on learners’ abilities and course objectives across all engineering disciplines.;2315217718;;;Scholarly Journals;;"Safapour, Elnaz;Kermanshachi, Sharareh;Taneja, Piyush";;; © 2019.

Teaching technology with technology: approaches to bridging learning and teaching gaps in simulation-based programming education: Revista de Universidad y Sociedad del Conocimiento;The learning of programming using simulation involves unique educational environments and human factors. However, research in this field has been mainly centred on the efficacy of the simulation tool whereas there is a lack of comparative studies between the associated teaching and learning procedures. To address the gap, this study facilitates an evidence-driven discussion on learning and teaching, as well as their relationship, in simulation-based programming education. Investigation areas include virtual and physical environments of simulation sessions, relevant learning enablers and impediments, and roles of students and faculty members in the process. The study followed qualitative methodology using focus groups and semi-structured interviews. Thirty-seven students and four lecturers on a computing course at a British university shared experiences and perceptions on simulation-based programming sessions. The data were analysed thematically and through cross-evaluation. The findings have provided fresh insights on several enabling and challenging aspects of simulation-based programming education. On the one hand, visualisation, consistency of learning procedures, and student engagement emerged as empowering factors. On the other, the negative implications of collaborative tasks, students’ attention diversion while shifting between virtual and physical environments of learning, and lecturers’ over-emphasis on technology in teaching preparation, appeared as challenges. The paper contributes to understanding the advantages and challenges of using simulation in programming education. It suggests essential teaching principles and their application procedures, which add value to the overall computing education at tertiary level. The learning is transferrable among other engineering programmes and academic disciplines that use simulation for educational purposes.;2267315391;;;Scholarly Journals; Research Fellow, Solent Learning & Teaching Institute, Solent University, Southampton, UK , Research Fellow, Solent Learning & Teaching Institute, Solent University, Southampton, UK;"Jamil, Md Golam;Isiaq, Sakirulai Olufemi";;; International Journal of Educational Technology in Higher Education is a copyright of Springer, (2019).

Preparing today’s educational software developers: voices from the field;Educational software is a growing industry, creating demand for professionals with the skills and knowledge necessary to develop high-quality learning software. This paper explores the perceptions and experiences of professionals who have made a career of developing educational software and suggests educational paths useful for professionals in the field. In-depth interviews (n = 9) and surveys (n = 92) were incorporated in this mixed-methods study. Topics addressed include developers’ backgrounds, perceptions of working in this field, roles played, alignment between educational background and roles, and suggestions for an ideal undergraduate degree for a career in educational software development. Participants’ formal education paths included computing, instructional design, and other backgrounds. Roles played varied based on those backgrounds. When asked for recommendations for an ideal educational program, the most frequent response was a hybrid/dual major. However, those with degrees in computing or instructional design were most likely to recommend a similar degree, and use of on-the-job self-study for other topics. Those without a computing degree frequently indicated that formal education in programming and technology was important, but less so than the ability to think critically. Those with a computing background indicated that a background in education was not necessary, although ideally computing students should gain experience delving into at least one industry so that they would be prepared to interact with specialists and stakeholders in any specialty area in the future. Throughout, participants noted the importance of professional skills, critical thinking, and life-long learning. Implications for educators and researchers are discussed.;2122917951;;;Scholarly Journals; Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN, USA , Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN, USA;"Exter, Marisa E;Ashby, Iryna";;; Journal of Computing in Higher Education is a copyright of Springer, (2018).

Problem Based Learning: A Facilitator of Computational Thinking;This paper explores and analyses the potential of Problem Based Learning (PBL) as a pedagogical framework for Computational Thinking (CT) in educations. CT skills are increasingly recognized as a necessity to all lines of study, as they not only facilitate digital proficiency, but potentially also a sense of computational empowerment and an ability to take a critical and constructive approach to applying computers when solving complex problems. The distinct focus on higher education is routed in theoretical as well as empirically based challenges, as this particular group of learners for the vast majority have started their education in a mainly analogue learning setting, yet now face employments with a much stronger demand for digital competences. With this paper, we aim to highlight the immediate benefits of PBL as a means to develop CT-skills as part of a higher education.;2317557024;;;Conference Papers & Proceedings;;"Jonasen, Tanja Svarre;Gram-Hansen, Sandra Burri";;" Aalborg University

Software Engineering Education Beyond the Technical: A Systematic Literature Review;Higher education provides a solid theoretical and practical, but mostly technical, background for the aspiring software developer. Research, however, has shown that graduates still fall short of the expectations of industry. These deficiencies are not limited to technical shortcomings. The ever changing landscape of 'lean' enterprise software development requires engineers to be equipped with abilities beyond the technical. How can higher education help students become great software developers in this context? As a first step towards answering this question, we present the results of a systematic literature review, focusing on noncognitive abilities, better known as 'soft skills'. Our results identify self-reflection, conflict resolution, communication, and teamwork as the top four taught skills. Internships and capstone projects require more attention as a teaching aspect to facilitate the learning of multiple skills, including creativity. Interdisciplinary teaching and group composition are other important factors that influence learning. By providing novel insights on relationships between noncognitive abilities and teaching aspects, this work contributes to the continuous improvement of software engineering curricula. These findings may also serve as a springboard for further investigation of certain undervalued skills.;2307883727;;;Working Papers;;"Groeneveld, Wouter;Vennekens, Joost;Aerts, Kris";;; © 2019.

Improving the soft skills of engineering undergraduates in Malaysia through problem-based approaches and e-learning applications;Purpose Various studies around the globe indicate lack of soft skills in engineering students, graduating from universities, although the bulk of studies in various disciplines indicate an improvement in various skills through implementation of a problem-based learning (PBL) approach. The purpose of this paper is therefore to identify and determine the effects of PBL in improving and developing soft skills, conflict resolution traits and aspects of enhancing group learning in undergraduates. Design/methodology/approach A study with mixed methods was used, involving questionnaire, observation and document analysis. A total of 57 students from different faculties participated in the semester-long study. Pre-tests and post-tests were administered at the beginning and end of the study. The researcher attended all the classes to observe systematically the teaching-learning process and its outcomes. Findings The findings revealed that PBL has a significant effect on improving students’ soft skills and enhancing group learning, including overcoming communication conflicts. Practical implications Practical implications of the study involve the enhancement of generic skills of the engineering graduates with the student-centered and interactive methodologies like PBL and e-learning applications. Originality/value This research endeavor stands unique due to its usage of e-learning tools in the PBL classroom learning such as Schoology, Padlet, videos, internet surfing. Another unique feature of this research is the holistic nature of the study, i.e. the measurement of a number of soft skills, traits and group learning skills that are not focused in other studies of engineering.;2292087576;;;Scholarly Journals;;"Deep, Sadia;Berhannudin Mohd Salleh;Othman, Hussain";;; © Emerald Publishing Limited 2019;; 10.1108/HESWBL-07-2018-0072; Journal Article;;; 2019;;2042-3896;4; English; English;; 662-676; Bingley;2019;Higher Education, Skills and Work - Based Learning;;2019;;;9;https://search.proquest.com/docview/2292087576?accountid=11774;;;;;; 2018-07-24 (Received) , 2018-11-21 (Revised) , 2019-01-13 (Revised) , 2019-02-22 (Revised) , 2019-03-05 (Accepted); 662;; Problem solving , Teaching , Research , Innovations , Students , Collaboration , Verbal communication , Diplomacy , Knowledge sharing , Knowledge acquisition , Meetings , Online instruction , Teamwork , Engineering , Clemency , Conflict resolution , Critical thinking , Problem based learning , Education , Skills , Malaysia; Problem-based learning , Generic skills , Communication conflicts , E-learning applications , Group learning;;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aabiglobal&amp;atitle=Improving+the+soft+skills+of+engineering+undergraduates+in+Malaysia+through+problem-based+approaches+and+e-learning+applications&amp;title=Higher+Education%2C+Skills+and+Work+-+Based+Learning&amp;issn=20423896&amp;date=2019-10-01&amp;volume=9&amp;issue=4&amp;spage=662&amp;au=Deep%2C+Sadia%3BBerhannudin+Mohd+Salleh%3BOthman%2C+Hussain&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=Higher+Education%2C+Skills+and+Work+-+Based+Learning&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/10.1108%2FHESWBL-07-2018-0072";ProQuest Central,Social Science Premium Collection
Teaching requirements elicitation interviews: an empirical study of learning from mistakes;"Interviews are the most widely used elicitation technique in requirements engineering (RE). However, conducting a requirements elicitation interview is challenging. The mistakes made in design or conduct of the interviews can create problems in the later stages of requirements analysis. Empirical evidence about effective pedagogical approaches for training novices on conducting requirements elicitation interviews is scarce. In this paper, we present a novel pedagogical approach for training student analysts in the art of elicitation interviews. Our study is conducted in two parts: first, we perform an observational study of interviews performed by novices, and we present a classification of the most common mistakes made; second, we utilize this list of mistakes and monitor the students’ progress in three set of interviews to discover the individual areas for improvement. We conducted an empirical study involving role-playing and authentic assessment in two semesters on two different cohorts of students. In the first semester, we had 110 students, teamed up in 28 groups, to conduct three interviews with stakeholders. We qualitatively analysed the data to identify and classify the mistakes made from their first interview only. In the second semester, we had 138 students in 34 groups and we monitored and analysed their progress in all three interviews by utilizing the list of mistakes from the first study. First, we identified 34 unique mistakes classified into seven high-level themes, namely question formulation, question omission, interview order, communication skills, analyst behaviour, customer interaction, teamwork and planning. In the second study, we discovered that the students struggled mostly in the areas of question formulation, question omission and interview order and did not manage to improve their skills throughout the three interviews. Our study presents a novel and repeatable pedagogical design, and our findings extend the body of knowledge aimed at RE education and training by providing an empirically grounded categorization of mistakes made by novices. We offer an analysis of the main pain points in which instructors should pay more attention during their design and training.";2226252504;;;Scholarly Journals; Swinburne University of Technology, Melbourne, Australia , University of Technology Sydney, Sydney, Australia , CNR-ISTI, Pisa, Italy , Kennesaw State University, Kennesaw, GA, USA , DILEF, University of Florence, Florence, Italy;"Bano, Muneera;Zowghi, Didar;Ferrari, Alessio;Spoletini, Paola;Donati, Beatrice";;; Requirements Engineering is a copyright of Springer, (2019).

Active Learning Approaches to Teaching Soil Science at the College Level;Traditional passive approaches to teaching, such as lectures, are not particularly effective at promoting student learning, or at developing the qualities that employers seek in graduates from soil science programs, such as problem-solving and critical thinking skills. In contrast, active learning approaches have been shown to promote these very qualities in students. Here I discuss my use of active learning approaches to teach soil science at the introductory and advanced levels, with particular focus on problem-based learning, and combined just-in-time teaching and peer instruction. A brief description of the each pedagogical approach is followed by evidence of its impact on student learning in general and, when available, its use in soil science courses. I describe and discuss my experiences using these approaches teaching introductory soil science (face-to-face and online), soil chemistry and soil microbiology courses, and provide examples of some of the problems I use. I have found the benefits to student learning in terms of student engagement, ownership of learning, and development of critical thinking and problem-solving skills easily outweigh are clear relative to traditional, passive approaches to teaching.;2281106337;;;Scholarly Journals;;Amador, Jose A;;" Prentice Hall Inc

Fostering Professional Competencies in Engineering Undergraduates with [email protected];"Since the engineering practice deals with the environment, professional ethics and behaviours, matters of health and safety, and discipline [3], additionally, this paper advocates the need to foster sustainable development (SD) and socio-professional ethics (SPE) (the two Ss) in the engineering practice. According to the Engineering Council [11], Bachelor’s degrees with honours are awarded to students who have demonstrated the following: 1. systematic understanding, including the acquisition of coherent and detailed knowledge, and conceptual understanding to critically evaluate, make judgements, and frame appropriate questions to achieve a solution—or identify a range of solutions—to a problem; 2. awareness of the uncertainty, ambiguity, and limits of knowledge; 3. ability to accurately apply methods and techniques of analysis and enquiry to review, consolidate, and extend their knowledge and understanding and to initiate and carry out projects; 4. ability to communicate information, ideas, problems, and solutions to both specialist and nonspecialist audiences. 5. ability to manage their own learning and to make use of scholarly reviews and primary sources. Specifically, ABET specifies under Criterion 3 the so-called a–k list of student outcomes [14]. [...]according to a survey distributed to USA employers by the National Association of Colleges and Employers (NACE) [15], the three most important skills of an engineer today are (i) the ability to communicate and work in teams; (ii) the ability to solve or troubleshoot problems in new or unfamiliar situations; and (iii) knowledge of a specific engineering discipline. According to the team, the product should “create a unique environment for the pet owner, where functionalities meet the client needs” [31]. [...]the final goal was to design, develop, and build a system allowing the pet owner not only to check the location of the pet but also to monitor and share on social media its daily level of activity.";2313726761;;;Scholarly Journals;;"Malheiro, Benedita;Guedes, Pedro;Silva, Manuel F;Ferreira, Paulo";;; © 2019.

The MOSAICS Model of Educational Approaches for Teaching the Practice of Software Project Management;Maybe you heard the line “managing programmers is like herding cats”, and if you consider there is some truth behind this, then you should, perhaps, think how it is to teach people to perform this job. As we know from the research literature, there is no such thing as a consensus about the most suitable teaching method of a software project management course targeted to information technology students. Moreover, the majority of publications focus on the theoretical aspects of the course, thus leaving little details about the application of the theory, or how to experience the practical side. The paper at hand proposes an abstract model of educational approaches, suggestively named MOSAICS, which may be used in teaching the practical side of a software project management course.;2309541804;;;Scholarly Journals;;"Costin-Anton Boiangiu;Iulia-Cristina Stănică";;" British Council

Engineering assessment strata: A layered approach to evaluation spanning Bloom’s taxonomy of learning;Fostering metacognition can be challenging within large enrollment settings, particularly within STEM fields concentrating on problem-solving skills and their underlying theories. Herein, the research problem of realizing more frequent, insightful, and explicitly-rewarded metacognition activities at significant scale is investigated via a strategy utilizing a hierarchy of assessments. Referred to as the STEM-Optimal Digitized Assessment Strategy (SODAS) , this targeted approach engages frequent assessment, instructor feedback, and learner self-reflection across the hierarchy of learning mechanisms comprising Bloom’s Taxonomy of Learning Domains. SODAS spans this hierarchy of learning mechanisms via a progression of (i) unregulated online assessment, (ii) proctored Computer-Based Assessment (CBA), (iii) problem-based learning activities assessed in the laboratory setting, and (iv) personalized Socratic discussions of scanned scrap sheets that accompanied each learner’s machine-graded formative assessments. Results of a case study integrating SODAS within a high-enrollment Mechanical Engineering Heat Transfer course at a large state university are presented for enrollment of 118 students. Six question types were delivered with lockdown proctored testing via auto-grading within the Canvas Learning Management System (LMS), along with bi-weekly laboratory activities to address the higher layers of Bloom’s Taxonomy. Sample assessment formats were validated through student use and schedules of responsibilities for instructors across four tiers of assessment levels (facts, concepts, procedures, and metacognition), two testing delivery mechanisms (electronic textbook exercises and proctored CBA), and three remediation mechanisms (self-paced, score clarification, and experiment clarification), which showed that learning achievement can increase by up to 16.9% compared to conventional assessment strategies, while utilizing comparable instructor resources and workloads.;2115924269;;;Scholarly Journals; Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Central Florida, Orlando, FL, USA , Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering, University of Central Florida, Orlando, FL, USA , Pegasus Innovation Lab, University of Central Florida, Orlando, FL, USA;"DeMara, Ronald F;Tian, Tian;Howard, Wendy";;; Education and Information Technologies is a copyright of Springer, (2018).

A Systematic Review of the Use of Agile Methodologies in Education to Foster Sustainability Competencies;[...]it is reasonable to hypothesize that the introduction of agile methodologies, which have been shown to be highly effective in improving the success of project and product delivery in private industry, as well as in different public institutions [28,29] when compared to traditional project management methodologies (see Figure 3), will benefit the teaching/learning processes in education. For the authors, not all students follow the same learning path and pace since each of them has their own background and learning style. [...]they can benefit from a personalized approach to teaching which is applicable by means of Agile teaching methodologies, which are considered to be all teaching approaches which have emphasis on the continuity of the learning process, are goal orientated, seek feedback from students, show flexibility in responding to student needs, present a short feedback cycle, and allow demand-based personalization of what is being taught. [...]the author defines these competencies as part of the learning objectives of an experiment in which Scrum is applied to manage a class project in the context of a course in a Primary Education Teaching degree. By showing that the students’ feedback is considered and cared for, a greater degree of engagement is achieved. [...]it has been observed that there is a clear link between key ESD competencies and key Agile Education Competencies, as summarized in Figure 6, and that Agile Methodologies can be customized to build powerful pedagogies based in collaboration, participation and practice to build competencies which scaffold pro-environmental attitudes in students, as future citizens. 6.5.;2322196572;;;Scholarly Journals;;"López-Alcarria, Abigail;Olivares-Vicente, Alberto;Poza-Vilches, Fátima";;; © 2019.

Computational Thinking and Robotics: A Teaching Experience in Compulsory Secondary Education with Students with High Degree of Apathy and Demotivation;In present and future society, all individuals must be able to face the problems, risks, advantages and opportunities that will arrive with new paradigms in the labour market, social relations and technology. To reach this goal, a quality and inclusive education together with a proper and complete formation in technology (communications, robotics, programming, computational thinking (CT), etc.) must be imparted at all educational levels. Moreover, all individuals should have the same opportunities to develop their skills and knowledge, as stated in Goal 4 of the Sustainable Development Goals, Sustainable Education. Following this trend, in the present work, a practical experience about how to teach CT using robotics is developed, showing the results and evaluation of the lessons on robotics taught to students in their 4th year of compulsory secondary education, and where the students showed a high degree of apathy and demotivation. The teaching unit was based on an action research approach that includes a careful selection of pedagogical techniques and instruments to attract and keep the attention and interest of the students. In addition to the robotics lessons, a previous computational thinking training with Blockly Games was carried out, which contributed to noticeably increase the students motivation and to introduce them to the programming of robots. Moreover, gamification was used to motivate and evaluate the individual knowledge, and the students were required to present the work performed through a final project. The individual needs of the students were fulfilled with a daily monitoring. The results show that the pedagogical techniques, instruments and evaluation were adequate to increase the motivation of the students and to obtain a significant learning, showing how the teaching of CT may attract students that have lost interest and motivation, while providing them with abilities that will be essential for the learning throughout life.;2398155799;;;Scholarly Journals;;"Díaz-Lauzurica, Belkis;Moreno-Salinas, David";;; © 2019.

UCTS FOUNDATION STUDENTS' PERCEPTION TOWARDS ARDUINO AS A TEACHING AND LEARNING TOOL IN STEM EDUCATION;This paper presents the perception of University College of Technology Sarawak (UCTS) students on the implementation of the Arduino lessons incorporated in Foundation in Science (FIS) and Foundation in Arts (FIA) programmes as part of STEM education. The low number of students studying or applying for STEM fields has been alarming in regards to the nation's future workforce needs. Efforts have been made to attract more students to STEM programmes and careers. This study is intended to examine whether Arduino, as a teaching and learning tool, helps in generating students' interests towards STEM programmes. Arduino is one of the physical computing tools which has open-source electronics platform based on user-friendly hardware and software for creating different projects and applications. Arduino is easy to be used by beginners, yet flexible enough for advanced users to learn physical computing and programming. Results revealed that participating students felt that they learnt programming the most during Arduino learning process and Arduino is proven to cultivate their STEM interests and 21st century skills. In this paper, the students' awareness and experiences on learning Arduino in STEM education were studied. This study can be used to determine whether educational institutions should implement Arduino lessons to promote STEM interests among the students which further lead them to opt for STEM-related degree programmes and careers.;2396318689;;;Scholarly Journals;;"Ling, Ong Sing;Wah, Jill Ling Pei";;; Copyright E-Bangi Journal 2019;;; Journal Article;;; 2019;;1985-3505;; English; English;; 1-21; Bangi;2019;e-BANGI;;2019;;;16;https://search.proquest.com/docview/2396318689?accountid=11774;;;;;;; 1;; Laboratories , Teaching , Software , Students , Collaboration , Workforce , Communication , Interdisciplinary aspects , Mathematics education , Logic programming , STEM education , 21st century , Core curriculum , Research & development--R&D , Mechanical engineering , Social research , Robotics , Technology education , Learning , College students , Science education , Teaching , Sensors , Creativity , Critical thinking , Problem based learning , Technology , 21st century , Malaysia , Sarawak Malaysia;;;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Asocscijournals&amp;atitle=UCTS+FOUNDATION+STUDENTS%27+PERCEPTION+TOWARDS+ARDUINO+AS+A+TEACHING+AND+LEARNING+TOOL+IN+STEM+EDUCATION&amp;title=e-BANGI&amp;issn=19853505&amp;date=2019-01-01&amp;volume=16&amp;issue=&amp;spage=1&amp;au=Ling%2C+Ong+Sing%3BWah%2C+Jill+Ling+Pei&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=e-BANGI&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/";ProQuest Central,Social Science Premium Collection
THE INFLUENCE OF SOCIAL CATEGORIES ON STUDENTS' SELF-SELECTED GROUP WORK FORMATION IN A PRIVATE UNIVERSITY IN MALAYSIA;When students of multi-ethnic and multi-lingual Malaysians and international students from culturally diverse backgrounds work together in group assignments, negotiations on whom to include or exclude would take place during the formation of self-selected groups. Social categories appears to influence students' choices in group membership during these face-to-face interactions. Set against the backdrop of Intercultural Communication, the objective of this study is to investigate the influence of the specific social categories of age, gender, nationality, ethnicity, religion, mother tongue and English language ability on self-selected group work formation. Relying on a basic quantitative approach for a case study, a set of questionnaire with a 5-point Likert-type scale was developed. Participants were asked whether or not they prefer to work with other participants from the same or similar social categories. The study found that in the formation of self-selected groups, the social categories of age and English language ability are significantly influential. This study affirms that social categories influence students' choices in self-selected group work formations.;2396318505;;;Scholarly Journals;;Lyn, Ong Sue;;; Copyright E-Bangi Journal 2019;;; Journal Article;;; 2019;;1985-3505;1; English; English;; 1-12; Bangi;2019;e-BANGI;;2019;;;16;https://search.proquest.com/docview/2396318505?accountid=11774;;;;;;; 1;; Research , Intercultural communication , Private schools , English language , Social categories , Group work , Gender , Researchers , Foreign students , Religion , Ethnicity , English language , Cognition & reasoning , Cooperative learning , Ethnicity , Intercultural communication , Religion , Membership , Social interaction , Age , College students , Studies , Multiculturalism & pluralism , Mother tongue , Attitudes , Malaysia;;;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Asocscijournals&amp;atitle=THE+INFLUENCE+OF+SOCIAL+CATEGORIES+ON+STUDENTS%27+SELF-SELECTED+GROUP+WORK+FORMATION+IN+A+PRIVATE+UNIVERSITY+IN+MALAYSIA&amp;title=e-BANGI&amp;issn=19853505&amp;date=2019-01-01&amp;volume=16&amp;issue=1&amp;spage=1&amp;au=Lyn%2C+Ong+Sue&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=e-BANGI&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/";ProQuest Central,Social Science Premium Collection
A Case Study on Finding Convenient Approach to Practice Agile Methodologies in Software Engineering Courses;"Dominance of agile methodologies triggered the need to include elements of agile methodologies in software engineering education. However, it turns out that finding convenient approach to practice agile methodologies in software engineering courses is not an easy task and could be full of pitfalls and obstacles. Based on the previous experiences and literature overview it can be concluded that it is not possible, or it could be extremely ineffective to use a methodology ""as-is"" in educational context, due to various problems in terms of course organization, work schedule and shortage of staff. Instead, method tailoring must be done, and the authors propose a method for a gentle introduction to agile methodologies by combining use of agile techniques like user stories and Kanban with continuous integration/deployment as one of the common engineering practices. The approach is a result of analysis of the mistakes from the past attempts and two semester long experiment conducted in authors' environment. The introduction to agile techniques could be done in an optional manner not obligating students to strictly follow it. They would not be graded for following it, as its purpose is that students should conclude that it could be useful to them and that it is not just another (from their perspective) useless obligation.

Developing Complex Problem-Solving Skills: An Engineering Perspective;While technical skills remain the core foundation for engineering graduates, professional competencies, including communication, teamwork, and complex problem solving, are increasingly important to succeed in work environments. To enhance the employability of our students, we have integrated several professional skills courses into our “Software Design and Engineering” Master study curriculum, and combined each of them with a technical course. In this paper, we present a blended-learning course design including didactic methods for teaching complex problem solving. The course is intertwined with a lecture on software integration topics, which enables the students to apply their complex problem solving skills on real projects in a domain-specific context.;2332963700;;;Scholarly Journals;;"Schefer-Wenzl, Sigrid;Miladinovic, Igor";;; © 2019.

Introducing Low-Cost Sensors into the Classroom Settings: Improving the Assessment in Agile Practices with Multimodal Learning Analytics;Currently, the improvement of core skills appears as one of the most significant educational challenges of this century. However, assessing the development of such skills is still a challenge in real classroom environments. In this context, Multimodal Learning Analysis techniques appear as an attractive alternative to complement the development and evaluation of core skills. This article presents an exploratory study that analyzes the collaboration and communication of students in a Software Engineering course, who perform a learning activity simulating Scrum with Lego ® bricks. Data from the Scrum process was captured, and multidirectional microphones were used in the retrospective ceremonies. Social network analysis techniques were applied, and a correlational analysis was carried out with all the registered information. The results obtained allowed the detection of important relationships and characteristics of the collaborative and Non-Collaborative groups, with productivity, effort, and predominant personality styles in the groups. From all the above, we can conclude that the Multimodal Learning Analysis techniques offer considerable feasibilities to support the process of skills development in students.;2301801654;;;Scholarly Journals;;"Cornide-Reyes, Hector;Noël, René;Riquelme, Fabián;Gajardo, Matías;Cechinel, Cristian;Roberto Mac Lean;Becerra, Carlos;Villarroel, Rodolfo;Munoz, Roberto";;; © 2019.

The teachers' weekly feedbacks regarding application structures and implementation processes were also supported the findings and revealed some more details that will be useful both for instructional designers and teachers.;2225786786;;;Scholarly Journals;;"Serhat Bahadir Kert;Kalelioğlu, Filiz;Gülbahar, Yasemin";;; Copyright Institute of Mathematics and Informatics 2019;; 10.15388/infedu.2019.06; Journal Article;;; 2019;;1648-5831;1; English; English;; 131-150; Vilnius;2019;Informatics in Education;;2019;;;18;https://search.proquest.com/docview/2225786786?accountid=11774;;;;;;; 131;; Design analysis , Curricula , Computation , Computer science , Academic achievement , Science education , Instructional materials , Instructional design , Students , Teachers;;;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aeducation&amp;atitle=A+Holistic+Approach+for+Computer+Science+Education+in+Secondary+Schools&amp;title=Informatics+in+Education&amp;issn=16485831&amp;date=2019-01-01&amp;volume=18&amp;issue=1&amp;spage=131&amp;au=Serhat+Bahadir+Kert%3BKalelio%C4%9Flu%2C+Filiz%3BG%C3%BClbahar%2C+Yasemin&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=Informatics+in+Education&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/10.15388%2Finfedu.2019.06";ProQuest Central,SciTech Premium Collection,Social Science Premium Collection
Mobile Learning System for Egyptian Higher Education Using Agile-Based Approach;Nowadays, due to easiness and expansion in property of smart mobile devices, it is becoming inevitable for mobile applications to have an important role in higher education systems. The Egyptian public universities are facing the problem of students’ large number enrolled in each year. Thus, we lack proper communication between educators and learners. Mobile learning can solve that problem, and it enables adjustment of the curriculum to meet students' learning time and life situations. It provides different solutions better than traditional educational methods. Students and professors could exchange educational material or information even if they are not in the same class. Furthermore, the cost of universities’ materials reduced, as all course materials can be found online through mobile applications. This paper proposes a mobile learning system named “Easy-Edu.” The proposed system intended to make the learning process easier, focus on students’ needs, and encourage communication and collaboration between students and professors and supports collaborative scenario-based learning for university students. Unlike other traditional systems, the proposed “Easy-Edu” was built using an Agile-based approach that delivers sustainable and high-quality mobile learning system. In addition, it eliminates the chances of absolute system failure and detects and fixes issues faster. Summarily, everything related to the design and implementation of “Easy-Edu” is discussed.;2212645976;;;Scholarly Journals;" Information Systems Department, Faculty of Computers and Information Science, Mansoura University, Mansoura 35516, Egypt , Information Systems Department, Faculty of Computers and Information Science, Mansoura University, Mansoura 35516, Egypt; Department of Computer Science, Faculty of Science and Arts, Jouf University, Saudi Arabia , Information Systems Department, Faculty of Computers and Information Science, Mansoura University, Mansoura 35516, Egypt";"Elkhateeb, Menna;Shehab, Abdulaziz;El-bakry, Hazem";;; Copyright © 2019 Menna Elkhateeb et al.

Such activities include instruction and instructional mechanism, learning activities, campus environment and infrastructure, innovations and interventions etc. Therefore, a university teacher should involve students in learning process through activities aiming to inculcate academic &amp; social skills among them.";2264565614;;;Scholarly Journals; Ramjas College, University of Delhi, New Delhi, India , Lakshmibai College, University of Delhi, New Delhi, India;"Sharma, Sonal;Kumar, Rakesh";;; Copyright New Delhi Publishers Dec 2018;; 10.30954/2249-6637.10.2018.5; Journal Article;;; Dec 2018;;2249-6637;4; English; English;; 469-474; New Delhi;Dec 2018;International Journal of Social Science;;2018;;;7;https://search.proquest.com/docview/2264565614?accountid=11774;;;;;;; 469;; Problem solving , Handbooks , Research , Cooperative learning , Higher education , Students , Theory , Active learning , College faculty , Classrooms , Physics , Teaching methods , Science education , Field trips , Knowledge , Educational technology , Inquiry method , Buddhism , Teachers , United States--US , India , San Francisco California;;;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aindianjournals&amp;atitle=Activity+Based+Learning+System+in+Higher+Education%3A+A+Student+Centred+Approach&amp;title=International+Journal+of+Social+Science&amp;issn=22496637&amp;date=2018-12-01&amp;volume=7&amp;issue=4&amp;spage=469&amp;au=Sharma%2C+Sonal%3BKumar%2C+Rakesh&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=International+Journal+of+Social+Science&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/10.30954%2F2249-6637.10.2018.5";ProQuest Central
Towards a process management life-cycle model for graduation projects in computer engineering;Graduation projects play an important role in computer engineering careers in which students are expected to draw upon their knowledge and skills that were acquired since admission. To manage the activities of graduation projects, an iterative and incremental approach which aims continuous improvement is proposed as an alternative to a controversial delivery model. However, such integration brings up a set of challenges to be taken into account: e.g. multiple project deliveries, more labor-intensive effort from instructors, and ultimately continuous learning for all participants. One promising way to achieve such an integrated and continuous deployment velocity is to eliminate potential bottlenecks by giving student teams to receive early and continuous feedback. To this end, we propose a continuous feedback and delivery mechanism for managing the life-cycle of a graduation project through draft proposal, literature review, requirements gathering, design, implementation and testing which should produce intermediate outputs at predefined intervals. Most importantly, our approach makes it possible to quantify most of the activities involved in life-cycle process with various rubrics (i.e. measurement scales) that have been purposefully developed. The proposed model promotes the fact that all improvements should be monitored, evaluated and documented. The results of this study indicate that students who were managed using this approach produced better project deliverables and ultimately have delivered better and successful projects.;2139590521;;;Scholarly Journals;;"Yilmaz, Murat;⨯ Faris Serdar Tasel;Gulec, Ulas;Sopaoglu, Ugur";;" National Academy of Engineering

Applying online competency-based learning and design-based learning to enhance the development of students’ skills in using PowerPoint and Word, self-directed learning readiness, and experience of online learning;"Online learning has been widely adopted in higher education, because it can help both teachers and students to achieve educational goals through better accessibility, flexibility, and interaction. As the Internet and educational technologies have evolved, however, educators indicate that online education and the related technology is more than just a technical consideration; thus, online educators and scholars should address the pedagogical perspectives of online learning. Therefore, this study attempts to provide an effective online teaching method and to investigate the effects of online competency-based learning (CBL) and design-based learning (DBL) on enhancing students’ learning performance, self-directed learning readiness (SDLR), and experience of online learning in an online computing course. The experimental design in this study involved a 2 (CBL vs. non-CBL) × 2 (DBL vs. non-DBL) factorial pretest/posttest design. Four classes in a course titled “Applied Information Technology: Office Software” were chosen for this research. Students involved in this experiment were from non-computer field departments at a comprehensive university. Based on the analysis carried out in this research, students who received the intervention with online DBL showed significantly better skills in using PowerPoint. However, learners who received the intervention with online CBL and/or DBL did not have significantly better SDLR or experience of online learning. The potential reasons for this insignificance in students’ SDLR and experience of online learning as well as their implications are reported in this paper.";2128363531;;;Scholarly Journals; Department of Information Management, Ming Chuan University, Taoyuan County, Taiwan, ROC;Chia-Wen Tsai;;; Universal Access in the Information Society is a copyright of Springer, (2018).

Investigating Flipped Classroom and Problem-based Learning in a Programming Module for Computing Conversion Course;This research paper investigates the effectiveness of combined Flipped Classroom (FC) and Problem-based Learning (PBL) teaching approach in a computer programming module. Combined FC-PBL makes use of learning technologies and supports authentic learning in terms of authentic context, multiple perspectives through team work and collaboration. FC involves watching educational videos prior to class session, and using the class session for practical tasks, thus supporting programming skills development. PBL enables authentic learning activities through group work and helps students to develop 21st century skills such as self-direction, collaboration, creativity and innovation. A research case study was conducted that considered a three-stage based delivery of the module that involved traditional, only FC, and combined FC-PBL teaching approaches applied on a number of programming topics. Both the educational and edutainment benefits were analyzed. The results show that combined FC-PBL approach is effective and the knowledge acquired by students improves, in particular, for the weaker students. Only 1.9% of students have scored an assessment mark lower than 40% compared to 28.3% and 24.5% when the traditional teaching and FC-only approaches respectively were used. Overall, a 26.56% increase in the assessment results was noticed when combined FC-PBL was used. The edutainment element was investigated through a questionnaire that assessed learning environment, engagement, learner satisfaction and whether the students have enjoyed learning sessions. The survey analysis shows that the combined FC-PBL approach does aid in the edutainment of mature students and provides an enjoyable learning experience.;2147868967;;;Scholarly Journals;;"Chis, Adriana E;Moldovan, Arghir-Nicolae;Murphy, Lisa;Pathak, Pramod;Cristina Hava Muntean";;; © 2018.

Using Project-Based Learning to Teach Learning Game Design: The Example of LIFE Project;"Making a digital game requires a sustained, coordinated effort of a team comprising many roles and a diverse range of skills: developers, artists, designers, producers, etc. This means that interpersonal skills such as communication, management, and leadership are also crucial. But can these skills be taught at the university? While traditional subject-based education can be effective at teaching technical skills such as programming and art creation, this paradigm ""provides little opportunity for students to acquire skills for &lt;...&gt; cooperative learning and problem solving"" (Mandl et al. 1996: 396). One way of addressing this challenge is through project-based learning (PBL), an approach to education that emphasizes student engagement, collaboration and hands-on learning through engagement with complex tasks based on real-life applications (Krajcik &amp; Blumenfeld 2006). This paper introduces an application of PBL to learning game design in the framework of LIFE (Learning in an Interdisciplinary Focused Environment), an initiative at Tallinn University which provides an alternative to subject-based education by inviting students to collaborate on interdisciplinary projects. Using self-reflection and semi-structured interviews, we surveyed LIFE participants whose projects focused on educational games in order to identify what competencies they believed the project helped them develop and what skills were still underdeveloped. While LIFE proved effective at producing a tangible outcome (i.e. a game) and facilitating participants' technical skills, the evidence of improvement in interpersonal skills is not as clear: some students reported significant improvement, while others were less enthusiastic. LIFE seemed to have little impact on management skills, as participants with previous project work experience were satisfied with their performance and growth, whereas those without it felt less motivated to manage projects again. The results may be indicative of the organizational aspects of LIFE project itself, whose self-organising nature can lead to a mismatch in existing technical and interpersonal competencies, as well as levels of motivation in the teams. These factors need to be taken into consideration for a successful application of project-based learning to educational game design.";2131784721;;;Conference Papers & Proceedings;;"Sillaots, Martin;Fiadotau, Mikhail";;" Tallinn University

The Effect of Coding Teaching on Students’ Self-Efficacy Perceptions of Technology and Design Courses;The aim of this research was to examine the effect of coding teaching on students’ self-efficacy perceptions of technology and design courses. A consecutive-explanatory design in a combined research model was used in this study. The qualitative dimension of the research was carried out through a random experimental design with pre/post-tests with controlled groups, and the qualitative dimension was conducted through interview techniques. The participants were seventh grade students from Şehit Hüseyin Ruso Secondary school in Lefkoşa, North Cyprus, in the 2016–2017 academic year. The quantitative data were collected through the “Technology and Design Course Self-efficacy Perception Scale”, developed by the researcher, and the qualitative data were collected through interview forms oriented around “Coding Teaching and Revised Technology and Design Course Teaching Program”. The quantitative data were analyzed through related and unrelated sampling t -test, Cohen’s d effect size coefficiency, and two-way variance analyses, and the qualitative data were analyzed through content analysis. A significant difference was observed between the students, taking coding teaching, and self-efficacy perceptions of Technology and Design courses compared to the control groups. Besides, it was noted that students taking coding teaching courses exhibited a positive attitude towards the course, and they practiced their metacognitive thinking and social skills at top levels. Based on the students’ views, it is obvious that coding teaching has a positive effect on their self-efficacy perceptions of the subject.;2126646739;;;Scholarly Journals;;"Özden, Celalettin;Tezer, Murat";;" Code.org

Using the Learner-Generated Digital Media (LGDM) Framework in Tertiary Science Education: A Pilot Study;[...]the aims of this research paper are (1) to use the LGDM framework to guide the implementation of digital presentations as assessment tools in tertiary learning and (2) to explore student perceptions about the use of Learner-Generated Digital Media (LGDM) assignments for learning scientific concepts. 2. [...]reinforcing takes place during the digital media production task, which is iterative and time-consuming [42]. [...]none of these models considered, for example, communicating to students the assessment task rationale, training the students in digital media principles, using an accurate marking rubric, ensuring healthy groupwork, or evaluating the intervention. [...]we identified that a simple model combining pedagogies, digital media training, video hosting, marking schemes, group contribution assessment, feedback, reflection, and evaluation was required to implement digital media assignments outside of the Education discipline. The next step in this project is to map the LGDM Framework against self-regulation subscales [94] and measure how students adapt to learning with LGDM assignments. Because LGDM assignments require a high level of autonomy [38] and are time-consuming [63], iterative, and resource-intensive processes [64], self-regulation could be a useful theoretical model for further research in the field [95,96].;2312966720;;;Scholarly Journals;;"Reyna, Jorge;Meier, Peter";;; © 2018.

We surveyed the correlation of students’ five factor model personalities and the learning effectiveness, which is the amount of increase in team management or technical knowledge, and skill, which is the IPA common carrier skill framework based on SFIA. Specifically, we targeted were three actual courses (a System Development Project course, an IT Management Project course, and an Application Development Project course) to elucidate the relationships between personality characteristics and learning effectiveness. Although individual students’ personality characteristics are not strongly related to learning effectiveness, team personality characteristics are related to learning effectiveness. In particular, Neuroticism and Conscientiousness characteristics are negatively correlated to learning effectiveness.;2306230440;;;Scholarly Journals;;"Shuto, Masashi;Washizaki, Hironori;Fukazawa, Yoshiaki;Yamato, Shoso;Okubo, Masashi;Tenbergen, Bastian";;; © 2018.

Assessment of problem solving ability in novice programmers;"Problem Solving (PS) skills allow students to handle problems within an educational context. PS is a core competence of Computer Science education and affects programming success. In this vein, this paper aims to investigate PS ability performance in primary school pupils of a computer course, implemented according to the Neo-Piagetian theory of cognitive development. The study included 945 Slovenian pupils, ranging from fourth to sixth grade. The effects of gender, age and consecutive years of attending the course were examined on pupils’ PS ability at the pre-operational and concrete operational stages. Pupils completed a survey questionnaire with four types of tasks (a series of statements, if-statements, loops and variables) at both stages. The analysis revealed three findings: the performance of PS ability in all tasks was, at the pre-operational stage, associated positively with performance at the concrete operational stage; there were no gender differences in PS performance at both stages, and both the grade and consecutive year of taking the computer course had an effect on PS ability performance at both stages. Those in the lowest grade and those taking the course for the first year reported lower performances than their older counterparts. These findings may help curriculum designers across the world develop efficient approaches to teaching computer courses.";2102903547;;;Scholarly Journals;;"Kožuh, Ines;Krajnc, Radovan;Hadjileontiadis, Leontios J;Debevc, Matjaž";;" European Commission

Teaching Software Engineering in K-12 Education: A Systematic Mapping Study;Diverse initiatives have emerged to popularize the teaching of computing in K-12 mainly through programming. This, however, may not cover other important core computing competencies, such as Software Engineering (SE). Thus, in order to obtain an overview of the state of the art and practice of teaching SE competences in K-12, we carried out a systematic mapping study. We identified 17 instructional units mostly adopting the waterfall model or agile methodologies focusing on the main phases of the software process. However, there seems to be a lack of details hindering large-scope adoption of these instructional units. Many articles also do not report how the units have been developed and/or evaluated. However, results demonstrating both the viability and the positive contribution of initiating SE education already in K-12, indicate a need for further research in order to improve computing education in schools contributing to the popularization of SE competencies.;2209645592;;;Scholarly Journals;;"Fernando Da Cruz Pinheiro;Christiane Gresse Von Wangenheim;Filho, Raul Missfeldt";;; Copyright Institute of Mathematics and Informatics 2018;; 10.15388/infedu.2018.10; Journal Article;;; 2018;;1648-5831;2; English; English;; 167-206; Vilnius;2018;Informatics in Education;;2018;;;17;https://search.proquest.com/docview/2209645592?accountid=11774;;;;;;; 167;; Mapping , Computation , Software engineering , Viability , Engineering education , Microprocessors , Software engineering , Education;;;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aeducation&amp;atitle=Teaching+Software+Engineering+in+K-12+Education%3A+A+Systematic+Mapping+Study&amp;title=Informatics+in+Education&amp;issn=16485831&amp;date=2018-07-01&amp;volume=17&amp;issue=2&amp;spage=167&amp;au=Fernando+Da+Cruz+Pinheiro%3BChristiane+Gresse+Von+Wangenheim%3BFilho%2C+Raul+Missfeldt&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=Informatics+in+Education&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/10.15388%2Finfedu.2018.10";ProQuest Central,SciTech Premium Collection,Social Science Premium Collection
Contrasting innovation competence FINCODA model in software engineering: Narrative review;Purpose: Innovation competences are expected both in businesses and in higher education. Software organizations, in particular, require engineers that collaborate to deliver better services and products. Staff recruitment and training are human resource management tasks that are crucial to insuring that applicants and job holders have the competences that will facilitate quality output in software development processes. This paper seeks to determine the competences that describe high-performing, innovative professionals in software engineering in order to weigh them against the FINCODA model on innovation competences devised to assess and enhance individuals’ capacity to innovate, a core outcome of the Framework for Innovation Competences Development and Assessment Project. Design/methodology/approach: A review protocol was followed to examine the literature on software engineering to identify the innovation competence and behavioral indicators that are required in individuals. Findings: According to the literature, the innovation competences required of the staff in software companies are creativity, critical thinking, initiative, team work and networking, dimensions that are contained in the FINCODA model. Findings also support the inclusion of the thirty-four behavioral indicators that constitute the five dimensions of the FINCODA model. Originality/value: Business organizations need tools to assess innovation competences in employees. Universities, as well, lack the instruments to measure development of innovation competence in undergraduates that teaching/learning methods should enhance before students reach the workplace. This research sheds light on innovative workplace behaviors of software engineers and on feasible designs of training programs for staff and undergraduates by using the FINCODA model and its behavioral indicators. Future research will focus on ratifying the validation of the model and the online assessment tool derived from it.;2162834559;;;Scholarly Journals;;"Andreu-Andres, Maria-Angeles;Gonzalez-Ladron-de-Guevara, Fernando R;Garcia-Carbonell, Amparo;Watts-Hooge, Frances";;; © 2018.

Learning activities as enactments of learning affordances in MUVEs: A review-based classification;"Three Dimensional Multi-User Virtual Environments (MUVEs) are promising tools in education because of the unique affordances they offer. These learning affordances imply certain actions that in turn can lead to corresponding learning activities. There seems to be a lack of reports on which of the affordances of MUVEs for learning and teaching are used and how they are enacted by relevantly designed learning activities. This study investigates the learning activities conducted in Second Life, the most popular and widely used among the ""sandbox"" type MUVE platforms, as reported in 205 empirical studies, by associating them with the learning affordances they enact. As necessary step towards this goal, the study proposes a new classification of learning affordances of MUVEs and a new concrete set of learning activities based on the literature review. Learning affordances include free navigation, creation, modeling and simulation, multichannel communication, collaboration and cooperation and content presentation and/or delivery. By using the open, axial and selective coding offered by the grounded method, the learning activities that emerged from the exhaustive empirical review, are well associated with the proposed six learning affordances, validating in return the functionality of the proposed set of learning affordances. The five more general learning activities, resulting from the selective coding, are content creation, content exploration and interaction with content, social interaction, gaming, participation in representations of real life events and situations. Further research on other MUVEs is needed to establish this framework.";1993488912;;;Scholarly Journals; The Educational Approaches to Virtual Reality Lab, University of Ioannina, Ioannina, Greece , The Educational Approaches to Virtual Reality Lab, University of Ioannina, Ioannina, Greece , The Educational Approaches to Virtual Reality Lab, University of Ioannina, Ioannina, Greece;"Mantziou, Olga;Papachristos, Nikiforos M;Mikropoulos, Tassos A";;; Education and Information Technologies is a copyright of Springer, (2018).

Assessing alignment between information technology educational opportunities, professional requirements, and industry demands;Information technology (IT) and computing are growing fields, offering far more job opportunities than applicants. Yet, little data are available to indicate how course content, employer needs, and additional learning opportunities work together the prepare graduates to enter the IT workforce. To understand the extent to which learners were prepared to for these highly technical careers, we used text analysis to examine the extent to which course syllabi, job postings, internship postings, and industry certifications from information technology preparation programs at state college and two universities commonly reflected national IT curriculum knowledge areas. Integrated data suggested that while the two-year and four-year programs imparted key technical skills, to qualify employers sought applied, or “soft,” skills such as critical thinking, problem solving, teamwork, and written and verbal communication. These soft skills were more difficult to detect as learning outcomes, but the determination of the extent to which the examined programs foster these skills presents a fertile area for subsequent research.;1980023066;;;Scholarly Journals; Florida State University, Tallahassee, USA , Emporia State University, Emporia, USA , Florida State University, Tallahassee, USA , Florida State University, Tallahassee, USA , Florida State University, Tallahassee, USA , University of Florida, Gainesville, USA , Florida State University, Tallahassee, USA;"Mardis, Marcia A;Ma, Jinxuan;Jones, Faye R;Ambavarapu, Chandrahasa R;Kelleher, Heather M;Spears, Laura I;McClure, Charles R";;; Education and Information Technologies is a copyright of Springer, (2017).

Continuous Delivery Pipelines for Teaching Agile and Developing Software Engineering Skills;"The amount of research reports on how to properly teach, in conjunction with technical topics, agile skills in undergraduate courses is a good indicator of how important are such skills in academy and industry nowadays. Such investigations have addressed challenges like how to engage students with agile principles and values without getting distracted by technology, or how to balance theory and practice to get students to meet learning objectives through practical experience. This paper intends to contribute to this research topic by describing new strategies for our particular needs for teaching agile in an introductory software engineering course, including better evaluation criteria for agile values and practices, and higher quality projects. The described strategies include a new approach for theoretical, laboratory, and project sessions arrangement, as well as a ‘Continuous Delivery Pipeline’ adapted to our educational context, with very promising results.&#xa0;";2073358242;;;Scholarly Journals;;Cadavid, Héctor F;;; © 2018.

Fostering Cooperative Learning with Scrum in a Semi-Capstone Systems Analysis and Design Course;Agile methods such as Scrum that emphasize technical, communication, and teamwork skills have been practiced by IT professionals to effectively deliver software products of good quality. The same methods combined with pedagogies of engagement can potentially be used in the setting of higher education to promote effective group learning in software development classrooms. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to integrate both Scrum and cooperative learning guidelines into a systems analysis and design classroom to promote the skills of teamwork, communication, and problem-solving while learning systems analysis and design methods. This integration was implemented in a sophomore, semi-capstone design course where students were engaged in collaborative classroom activities. Two different approaches--overlapped approach and delayed approach--were used in two different semesters for this implementation. Based on the analysis of student performance in the course, student reflections on their team performance, and student overall perceptions of the teaching approach, this study suggests that the integration of cooperative learning and Scrum serves as guidance for students to effectively analyze and design software solutions, as well as to reflect on their team performance and learning process. In addition, a delayed approach for Scrum implementation appears to effectively support student learning by providing better and earlier feedback.;2101401832; EJ1182639;;Scholarly Journals;;"Magana, Alejandra J.;Seah, Ying Ying;Thomas, Paul";;;;;; Article , Report , 080: Journal Articles , 143: Reports - Research;;; Apr 2018 - Jun 2018;;1055-3096;2; English; English;; 75-91;;Apr 2018 - Jun 2018;Journal of Information Systems Education; Scholarly Journals , Reports;2018; http://www.jise.org; ERIC, © Journal of Information Systems Education;29;https://search.proquest.com/docview/2101401832?accountid=11774;;;;;;; 75;;  2236ER5 5901ER5  2225 5882 ,  1578ER5 9179ER5 126ER5  1571 9146 126 ,  2780ER5  2768 ,  10664ER5 3241ER5 6603ER5  10621 3227 6582 ,  10685ER5 4527ER5 912ER5  10642 4511 909 ,  5185ER5 10713ER5  5168 10669 ,  2070ER5  2059 ,  2526ER5  2515 ,  11139ER5 1815ER5 10321ER5 8043ER5 4558ER5  11095 1806 10278 8016 4542 ,  10219ER5 732ER5  10181 730 ,  5923ER5 1719ER5  5904 1710 ,  5265ER5  5248 ,  3939ER5 5365ER5 8800ER5  3924 5348 8768 ,  5184ER5  5167 ,  2065ER5 5172ER5 8290ER5 3164ER5  2054 5155 8260 3150 ,  10282ER5 9179ER5 126ER5  10240 9146 126 ,  124ER5 5901ER5  124 5882 ,  28ER5 96ER5  28 96 ,  10125ER5 2586ER5 3643ER5 6603ER5  10087 2574 3629 6582 , Indiana; Higher Education , Indiana;;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aeric&amp;atitle=Fostering+Cooperative+Learning+with+Scrum+in+a+Semi-Capstone+Systems+Analysis+and+Design+Course&amp;title=Journal+of+Information+Systems+Education&amp;issn=10553096&amp;date=2018-04-01&amp;volume=29&amp;issue=2&amp;spage=75&amp;au=Magana%2C+Alejandra+J.%3BSeah%2C+Ying+Ying%3BThomas%2C+Paul&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=Journal+of+Information+Systems+Education&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/EJ1182639&amp;rft_id=info:doi/";Social Science Premium Collection
Applying Multidisciplinary Teaching Techniques to the Computer Programming/Coding Classroom;As we move into the 21st century, there will be a significant increase in the need for computer coders and programmers in STEM and other technical jobs. The broadening of the student base, and their respective variations of skills, necessitates a review and reconsideration of the way computer programming is taught if it is to attain maximum success. This paper approaches computer programming education from a multidisciplinary perspective, comparing it to the learning of a language as a foreign language versus a second language. Various techniques are evaluated within the parameters of both Dale's Cone of Experience and Bloom's Taxonomy to craft an effective learning environment.;2063390947;;;Scholarly Journals; IT Department, Computer Information Studies Program Mott Community College, Flint, MI USA LindaLee.Massoud@mcc.edu , Higher Education and Business Consultant Accreditation Mentor / Evaluator HallmanDBA@yahoo.com , Dept.

Agile in Teaching and Learning: Conceptual Framework and Research Agenda;"Agile software development methods are widespread in industry, and there is a wealth of academic research and practitioner publications currently available from this perspective. With the rise of Agile within companies worldwide, it is increasingly important for information systems education to keep up with this trend to ensure curriculum and courses are up-to-date. Students in the computing disciplines must be prepared to enter a job market where Agile is commonplace. As such, the topic of Agile in teaching and learning is critically important. The current special issue includes a rich collection of articles providing information systems educators with research-based, practical approaches for both teaching Agile (""the what"") and using Agile as a pedagogical approach (""the how""). In an effort to assist information systems educators categorize the growing amount of literature related to Agile in teaching and learning, a conceptual framework is provided which places the literature along the two axes of pedagogy (""the how"") and the content (""the what"") ranging from other, non-Agile to Agile. Finally, the authors present a call for future research integrating Agile on a meta-level in the course development process.

In addition, a delayed approach for Scrum implementation appears to effectively support student learning by providing better and earlier feedback.;2056814093;;;Scholarly Journals;;"Magana, Alejandra J;Seah, Ying Ying;Thomas, Paul";;; Copyright EDSIG Spring 2018;;; Journal Article;;; Spring 2018;;1055-3096;2; English; English;; 75-91; West Lafayette;Spring 2018;Journal of Information Systems Education;;2018;;;29;https://search.proquest.com/docview/2056814093?accountid=11774;;;;;;; 75;; Information systems , Skills , Systems analysis , Teamwork , Educational technology , Problem solving , Students , Cooperative learning , Design analysis , Software quality , Systems analysis , Project management , Learning , Product development , Classrooms , Design engineering , Information technology , Software engineering , Teamwork , Seminars;;;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aabiglobal&amp;atitle=Fostering+Cooperative+Learning+with+Scrum+in+a+Semi-Capstone+Systems+Analysis+and+Design+Course&amp;title=Journal+of+Information+Systems+Education&amp;issn=10553096&amp;date=2018-04-01&amp;volume=29&amp;issue=2&amp;spage=75&amp;au=Magana%2C+Alejandra+J%3BSeah%2C+Ying+Ying%3BThomas%2C+Paul&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=Journal+of+Information+Systems+Education&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/";ProQuest Central,SciTech Premium Collection,Social Science Premium Collection
A software engineering team research mapping study;Purpose The purpose of this mapping study has been performed to identify, critically analyze and synthesize research performed in the area of software engineering teams. Teams, in a general sense, have been studied extensively. But the distinctive processes that need to be executed effectively and efficiently in software engineering require a better understanding of current software engineering team research. Design/methodology/approach In this work, software engineering team publications were analyzed and the key findings of each paper that met our search inclusion criteria were synthesized. In addition, a keyword content analysis was performed to create a taxonomy to categorize each paper and evaluate the state of software engineering team research. Findings In software engineering team research, the resulting areas that are the most active are teamwork/collaboration, process/design and coordination. Clear themes of analysis have been determined to help understand how team members collaborate, factors affecting their success and interactions among all project stakeholders. In addition, themes related to tools to support team collaboration, improve the effectiveness of software engineering processes and support team coordination have been found. However, the research gaps determined from the content analysis point toward a need for more research in the area of communication and tools. Originality/value The goal of this work is to define the span of previous research in this area, create a taxonomy to categorize such research and identify open research areas to provide a clear road map for future research in the area of software engineering teams. These results, along with the key finding themes presented, will help guide future research in an area that touches all parts of the software engineering and development processes.;2050873215;;;Scholarly Journals; The Pennsylvania State University, Malvern, Pennsylvania, USA , The Pennsylvania State University, Malvern, Pennsylvania, USA;"DeFranco, Joanna F;Laplante, Phillip";;; © Emerald Publishing Limited 2018;; 10.1108/TPM-08-2017-0040; Journal Article;;; 2018;;1352-7592;3/4; English; English;; 203-248; Bradford;2018;Team Performance Management;;2018;;;24;https://search.proquest.com/docview/2050873215?accountid=11774;;;;;;; 203;; International conferences , Teamwork , Embedded systems , Collaboration , Virtual teams , Success , Managers , Communication , Cooperation , Software engineering , Knowledge sharing , Empowerment , Volatility , Studies;;;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aabiglobal&amp;atitle=A+software+engineering+team+research+mapping+study&amp;title=Team+Performance+Management&amp;issn=13527592&amp;date=2018-04-01&amp;volume=24&amp;issue=3%2F4&amp;spage=203&amp;au=DeFranco%2C+Joanna+F%3BLaplante%2C+Phillip&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=Team+Performance+Management&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/10.1108%2FTPM-08-2017-0040";ProQuest Central
Web-Mediated Problem-Based Learning and Computer Programming: Effects of Study Approach on Academic Achievement and Attitude;"In the relevant literature, it is often debated whether learning programming requires high-level thinking skills, the lack of which consequently results in the failure of students in programming. The complex nature of programming and individual differences, including study approaches, thinking styles, and the focus of supervision, all have an effect on students' achievement in programming. How students learn programming and the relationships between their study approaches and their achievement in programming have not yet been adequately illuminated. In this regard, the present study aims to investigate the effect of the study approach used on students' attitudes toward programming and on their academic achievement within an online problem-based learning environment. In this study, a single-factor, pretest posttest single group and semiempirical method was utilized. The study was conducted on 41 students from a public university in Turkey. To implement problem-based learning activities, a teaching environment was created with the Moodle platform, allowing for group work and discussions. Seven status of the problems were prepared exclusively for the 12-week application period so that students could make suggestions about how to solve them. In the data collection phase, the Study Approach Scale, the Attitude Towards Programming Scale, and the Academic Achievement Test were employed. T-test and covariance analyses were carried out in the statistical analysis phase. According to the findings of the present study, students adopting the ""deep"" study approach were more successful than the students adopting a ""superficial"" approach. Moreover, it was determined that the problem-based learning application had a positive effect on students' attitudes toward programming and that the study approach did not significantly affect the students' attitude toward programming.";2034275313; EJ1173044;;Scholarly Journals;;Yagci, Mustafa;;;;;; 080 Journal Articles , 143 Reports - Research;;; April 2018;;0735-6331;2; English; English;; 272-292;;April 2018;Journal of Educational Computing Research; CSAPTjournals , CSAPTreports;2018; http://sagepub.com;;56;https://search.proquest.com/docview/2034275313?accountid=11774;;;;;;; 272;;  8257ER5 5901ER5  8227 5882 ,  11484ER5 2085ER5 2084ER5 10719ER5 10664ER5 3241ER5 6603ER5  11438 10621 3227 6582 2074 2073 10675 ,  8359ER5 2064ER5 5171ER5 9385ER5 5983ER5  8328 2053 5154 9351 5964 ,  2065ER5 5172ER5 8290ER5 3164ER5  2054 5155 8260 3150 ,  28ER5 96ER5  28 96 ,  10219ER5 732ER5  10181 730 ,  8195ER5 10833ER5 6468ER5  8166 10789 6447 ,  1815ER5 10321ER5 8043ER5 4558ER5  1806 10278 8016 4542 ,  4124ER5 4350ER5  4109 4335 ,  10125ER5 2586ER5 3643ER5 6603ER5  10087 2574 3629 6582 ,  10330ER5 918ER5  10287 915; Higher Education;;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aeric&amp;atitle=Web-Mediated+Problem-Based+Learning+and+Computer+Programming%3A+Effects+of+Study+Approach+on+Academic+Achievement+and+Attitude&amp;title=Journal+of+Educational+Computing+Research&amp;issn=07356331&amp;date=2018-04-01&amp;volume=56&amp;issue=2&amp;spage=272&amp;au=Yagci%2C+Mustafa&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=Journal+of+Educational+Computing+Research&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/EJ1173044&amp;rft_id=info:doi/";Social Science Premium Collection
Snowman: Agile development method with institutionalized communication and documentation for capstone projects;Numerous organizations currently implement agile methods in practical software development processes. Using agile methods involves mutually strengthening communication to ease the burden involved in documenting plan-driven projects. A focus on people-oriented communication has resulted in agile methods being diverted from development processes that codify formal documents. This situation makes follow-up software maintenance difficult. This paper proposes an appropriate and concrete approach for streamlining communication and documentation in software engineering education called the Snowman approach.

Adjustments of Methodology Planning and Assessment Activities of Senior Projects in the Computer Science Program;The senior project stage in bachelor’s degrees represents an essential milestone in the learning process of a Computer Science (CS) student. The Senior Project Management System (SPMS) plays an important role in refining the quality of the resulting product and improving the learning experience of students. The CS department at King Abdulaziz University (KAU) has followed a well-defined system for managing senior projects since 2012. Systems evolve through time in response to encounters that unfold when the system is put to use. The administration of CS senior projects is no exception. In this paper, we present some incremental changes that have been introduced as refinements to the original system. This paper focuses on analyzing the data of the projects conducted during 2015 and 2016 in the Computer Science Department, Girls Main Campus (GMC) branch from the following perspectives: the project plan and deliverables at each milestone, and the provision of constructive mature collective feedback by the evaluating committee. These refinements are called addendums as they are additional steps to the SPMS and each step is monitored by using forms. This paper also describes some practices that support the SPMS along with the rationale behind their application. Evidence for the two addendums have been collected from analysis of the relevant forms. The analysis showed that the students benefited from the flexibility introduced by the milestone addendum as they made use of the new options. In addition, analysis of the forms of the feedback addendum showed that this documentation served as a means to gather the overall collective opinion of the committee members as opposed to the individual assessment of each member. Additional evidence was collected from evaluation committee members, by conducting a questionnaire. It showed that participants do benefit from the discussion promoted by the feedback addendum.;2018703835;;;Scholarly Journals;;"Fadel, Mai A;Elrefaei, Lamiaa A";;; Copyright Modern Education and Computer Science Press Feb 2018;; 10.5815/ijmecs.2018.02.02; Journal Article;;; Feb 2018;;2075-0161;2; English; English;;; Hong Kong;Feb 2018;International Journal of Modern Education and Computer Science;;2018;;;10;https://search.proquest.com/docview/2018703835?accountid=11774;;;;;;; 16;; Computer science , Feedback , Feedback , Project management , Students , Technology education , Higher education , Learning , Colleges & universities; Computer Science (CS) , Senior Project Management System (SPMS) , Milestones , Feedback;;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aeducation&amp;atitle=Adjustments+of+Methodology+Planning+and+Assessment+Activities+of+Senior+Projects+in+the+Computer+Science+Program&amp;title=International+Journal+of+Modern+Education+and+Computer+Science&amp;issn=20750161&amp;date=2018-02-01&amp;volume=10&amp;issue=2&amp;spage=16&amp;au=Fadel%2C+Mai+A%3BElrefaei%2C+Lamiaa+A&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=International+Journal+of+Modern+Education+and+Computer+Science&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/10.5815%2Fijmecs.2018.02.02";ProQuest Central,SciTech Premium Collection,Social Science Premium Collection
Enhancing the Student Learning Experience in Software Engineering Project Courses;Carrying out real-world software projects in their academic studies helps students to understand what they will face in industry, and to experience first-hand the challenges involved when working collaboratively. Most of the instructional strategies used to help students take advantage of these activities focus on supporting agile programming, which is appropriate for capstone courses. This is not always recommended in initial software engineering project courses, however, where novice developers run projects in teams while simultaneously taking other courses. To enhance the learning and teamwork experience in this latter instructional scenario, this paper proposes a formative monitoring method, reflexive weekly monitoring (RWM), for use in project courses that involve disciplined software processes and loosely coupled work. RWM uses self-reflection and collaborative learning practices to help students be aware of their individual and team performance. RWM was applied in a case study over nine consecutive semesters. The results obtained indicate that RWM was effective in enhancing the learning experience in the instructional scenario studied. While students in the monitored teams were more effective and coordinated, and experienced a higher sense of team belonging and satisfaction, little evidence was found of them being more productive than students working in non-monitored teams.;2013525791; EJ1168677;;Scholarly Journals;;"Marques, Maira;Ochoa, Sergio F.;Bastarrica, Maria Cecilia;Gutierrez, Francisco J.";;;;; 10.1109/TE.2017.2742989; Article , Report , 080: Journal Articles , 143: Reports - Research;;; Feb 2018;;0018-9359;1; English; English;; 63-73;;Feb 2018;IEEE Transactions on Education; Scholarly Journals , Reports;2018; http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/RecentIssue.jsp?punumber=13; ERIC, © Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers;61;https://search.proquest.com/docview/2013525791?accountid=11774;;;;;;; 63;;  3488ER5 8290ER5 3164ER5  3474 8260 3150 ,  2070ER5  2059 ,  2236ER5 5901ER5  2225 5882 ,  6584ER5 1719ER5  6563 1710 ,  1331ER5 8868ER5 3643ER5 6603ER5  1326 3629 6582 8836 ,  5912ER5 3700ER5 856ER5  5893 3685 853 ,  10282ER5 9179ER5 126ER5  10240 9146 126 ,  5123ER5 1205ER5  5106 1202 ,  11600ER5 3532ER5  11554 3518 ,  10664ER5 3241ER5 6603ER5  10621 3227 6582 ,  8359ER5 2064ER5 5171ER5 9385ER5 5983ER5  8328 2053 5154 9351 5964 ,  10685ER5 4527ER5 912ER5  10642 4511 909 ,  5923ER5 1719ER5  5904 1710 ,  124ER5 5901ER5  124 5882 ,  10219ER5 732ER5  10181 730 ,  11139ER5 1815ER5 10321ER5 8043ER5 4558ER5  11095 1806 10278 8016 4542 ,  2065ER5 5172ER5 8290ER5 3164ER5  2054 5155 8260 3150 ,  4124ER5 4350ER5  4109 4335 ,  10125ER5 2586ER5 3643ER5 6603ER5  10087 2574 3629 6582 ,  2218ER5 8884ER5 6603ER5 4558ER5  2207 4542 8852 6582 ,  3713ER5 8884ER5 6603ER5 4558ER5  3698 4542 8852 6582 ,  1966ER5 3643ER5 6603ER5  1955 3629 6582 ,  5265ER5  5248 , Chile; Higher Education , Chile;;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aeric&amp;atitle=Enhancing+the+Student+Learning+Experience+in+Software+Engineering+Project+Courses&amp;title=IEEE+Transactions+on+Education&amp;issn=00189359&amp;date=2018-02-01&amp;volume=61&amp;issue=1&amp;spage=63&amp;au=Marques%2C+Maira%3BOchoa%2C+Sergio+F.%3BBastarrica%2C+Maria+Cecilia%3BGutierrez%2C+Francisco+J.&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=IEEE+Transactions+on+Education&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/EJ1168677&amp;rft_id=info:doi/10.1109%2FTE.2017.2742989";Social Science Premium Collection
Biosignals reflect pair-dynamics in collaborative work: EDA and ECG study of pair-programming in a classroom environment;Collaboration is a complex phenomenon, where intersubjective dynamics can greatly affect the productive outcome. Evaluation of collaboration is thus of great interest, and can potentially help achieve better outcomes and performance. However, quantitative measurement of collaboration is difficult, because much of the interaction occurs in the intersubjective space between collaborators. Manual observation and/or self-reports are subjective, laborious, and have a poor temporal resolution. The problem is compounded in natural settings where task-activity and response-compliance cannot be controlled. Physiological signals provide an objective mean to quantify intersubjective rapport (as synchrony), but require novel methods to support broad deployment outside the lab. We studied 28 student dyads during a self-directed classroom pair-programming exercise. Sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous system activation was measured during task performance using electrodermal activity and electrocardiography. Results suggest that (a) we can isolate cognitive processes ( mental workload ) from confounding environmental effects , and (b) electrodermal signals show role - specific but correlated affective response profiles . We demonstrate the potential for social physiological compliance to quantify pair-work in natural settings, with no experimental manipulation of participants required. Our objective approach has a high temporal resolution, is scalable, non-intrusive, and robust.;2002649736;;;Scholarly Journals;" Finnish Institute of Occupational Health, Helsinki, Finland , Finnish Institute of Occupational Health, Helsinki, Finland; Cognitive Science, Department of Digital Humanities, University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland; Cognitive Brain Research Unit, Department of Psychology and Logopedics, University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland , Department of Computer Science, University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland , Finnish Institute of Occupational Health, Helsinki, Finland; Department of Computer Science, Aalto University, Helsinki, Finland";"Ahonen, Lauri;Cowley, Benjamin Ultan;Hellas, Arto;Puolamäki, Kai";;; © 2018.

The Effect of Coding Teaching on Students’ Self-Efficacy Perceptions of Technology and Design Courses;The aim of this research was to examine the effect of coding teaching on students’ self-efficacy perceptions of technology and design courses. A consecutive-explanatory design in a combined research model was used in this study. The qualitative dimension of the research was carried out through a random experimental design with pre/post-tests with controlled groups, and the qualitative dimension was conducted through interview techniques. The participants were seventh grade students from Şehit Hüseyin Ruso Secondary school in Lefkoşa, North Cyprus, in the 2016–2017 academic year. The quantitative data were collected through the “Technology and Design Course Self-efficacy Perception Scale”, developed by the researcher, and the qualitative data were collected through interview forms oriented around “Coding Teaching and Revised Technology and Design Course Teaching Program”. The quantitative data were analyzed through related and unrelated sampling t -test, Cohen’s d effect size coefficiency, and two-way variance analyses, and the qualitative data were analyzed through content analysis. A significant difference was observed between the students, taking coding teaching, and self-efficacy perceptions of Technology and Design courses compared to the control groups. Besides, it was noted that students taking coding teaching courses exhibited a positive attitude towards the course, and they practiced their metacognitive thinking and social skills at top levels.

Toward Increased Retention in University Computer Science Programs A Language Socialization Approach;"This dissertation is a mixed-methods ethnographic study of students in the introductory class in the Engineering &amp; Computer Science (ECS) department at University of California, Davis (UC Davis). I collected audio-recorded natural speech and questionnaire data from students attending this course during two academic quarters, Fall 2016 and Winter 2017. Between these two quarters, the instructor of the course introduced a new mandatory class activity that required students to speak to each other in order to complete it. Using this difference, I investigated the nature of peer socialization in Computer Science pedagogy by comparing the speech of students as they spoke to instructors to the speech of students as they spoke to peers. Using Language Socialization Theory and its related analytical methods, and employing Politeness Theory as a way to understand how students’ understanding of academic and cultural concepts is mediated by conversational practice, I pursue workable recommendations to share with educators in CS and other engineering fields. Instructors employed repetition as well as linguistic and metalinguistic coercion in order to provide sufficient stimuli to the learners as they worked to acquire new terms. Students speaking to teachers tended to avoid the use of class terms even when such avoidance, a violation of the Gricean maxim of quantity, created disfluency or confusion. These behaviors were supported and allowed by the instructors but not by peers. Non-expert use of terms was allowed by TAs and peers but not by the professor. Analysis of politeness demonstrated that students were much more reticent to impose on the instructors by asking for help, and that instructors’ concern for the face needs of their students tended to impede their ability to facilitate learning in one-on-one interaction. Between students and instructors, I found frequent repairs, pauses, filler markers, mitigation and minimization, and indirect speech acts. Between peers, I found frequent laughter, higher frequency of conversational turn-taking, boosting, and bald on-record strategies. Students speaking to peers used follow-up questions to ensure clear communications, which they avoided with instructors. When instructors asked students to volunteer to answer questions in front of the class, women tended not to answer at all. Students who did choose to answer did so in extremely short sentence fragments, and they often made use of high-rising terminal or question words. Students answering questions posed by peers spoke in complete sentences, using both on-record politeness and bald on-record strategies to do so, even when calling attention to a knowledge gap in their peers. Instructors, upon hearing student responses, would repeat their answers exactly, then provide commentary as to their stance on the answer. Students hearing a peer’s answer would instead reword the answer to test his or her own understanding, seeking validation from their peer. Talk between peers seems to be accompanied by significantly less positive and negative face threat than that between students and instructors across several contexts within the ECS 10 course, and pair programming appears to require more active construction of knowledge from students than do activities involving speaking to an instructor. Some discourses were recorded describing programmers as unkind and unlikeable. One core value of programmers, efficiency, was communicated via several diverse methods, but it appears to have been taken up by several of the students. It was also not typically accompanied by these discourses about what a programmer’s personality was like, which may have contributed to students’ relative ease of uptake. Some students, particularly women, who encountered difficulties, tended to describe those difficulties as a sign of their natural poor fit for the field. Increasing the amount of pair work students had to do may have decreased the effect of that tendency, as gender had less to do with grades and retention in the treatment quarter than in the control. Asking instructors to make slight changes to their linguistic and discursive practices, alongside adding collaborative learning opportunities, is likely to create positive change in the learning of all students, particularly those in underrepresented groups.";2302688387;;;Dissertations & Theses;;Green, Caitlin Moriah;;;" Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.";;; Dissertation/Thesis;;; 2018; 9781085757966;;; English; English;;;;2018;ProQuest Dissertations and Theses;;2018;;;;https://search.proquest.com/docview/2302688387?accountid=11774;; 0290 Linguistics; 0290 Linguistics;; 0290 Linguistics;;; 0290 Linguistics; Linguistics; Applied linguistics , Computer science , Discourse analysis , Language socialization , Politeness theory , Pragmatics;;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:Linguistics+and+Language+Behavior+Abstracts+%28LLBA%29&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Toward+Increased+Retention+in+University+Computer+Science+Programs+A+Language+Socialization+Approach&amp;issn=&amp;date=2018-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Green%2C+Caitlin+Moriah&amp;isbn=9781085757966&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/";ProQuest Central,Social Science Premium Collection
A systematic review of work-integrated learning for the digital economy;This paper presents research related to the work-integrated learning (WIL) model. The objectives were to explore the characteristics and the techniques associated with it. The focus of this research was on model linked to the IT industry or IT department in non-IT industries. A systematic literature review was applied as research methodology and the collected data were from 2006 to 2016 from eight databases. There were 24 articles which matched the search criteria. The WIL models reported can be separated into four groups. The two key features are activities created by universities and activities offered by industry. The model techniques are knowledge, methods and tools for acquiring research problems and developing solutions. The existing models are very broad and need to be narrowed down so that prospective careers and the needs of the digital workforce are prioritized. Researchers suggest future trends in WIL models in the digital economy.;2227915376;;;Scholarly Journals;;"Siddoo, Veeraporn;Janchai, Worawit;Sawattawee, Jinda";;; © 2018.

The Cost-Effectiveness of Project-Based Learning in Relation to 11th Grade Literacy;The purpose of this study was to determine the effects of project-based learning on the scale scores of 11 th grade students on Arkansas’ 11 th Grade End of Course Literacy exam and to determine the cost effectiveness of project-based learning by determining the return on investment and productivity of a project-based learning model. I compared the scale scores of students who received instruction via project-based learning (PBL) classrooms to the scale scores of their peers who received instruction in traditional learning environments. Quantitative analysis was performed to determine if there was a significant difference in scale scores between the two instructional models when controlling for race, gender, and socioeconomic status. Finally, I examined the cost-effectiveness and productivity of PBL through the use of a return on investment calculation and productivity model graph. I examined student data from the 2010–2011, 2011–2012, 2012–2013, and 2013–2014 school years Arkansas End of Course Literacy exam. Sample selection was derived from the 11 th grade students (approx. 2,000) in the 10 high schools selected for participation in the state of Arkansas’ New Tech Network implementation grant. Student scale scores from 2010–2011 and 2011–2012 school years were examined before implementation of PBL, and 2012–2013 and 2013–2014 data were examined following implementation of PBL Historical data were gathered via a data request to the Arkansas Department of Education.;2165813352;;;Dissertations & Theses;;Hart, Bobby R.;;;" Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.";;; Dissertation/Thesis;;; 2018; 978-0-438-76524-5;;; English; English;;;;2018;ProQuest Dissertations and Theses;;2018;;;;https://search.proquest.com/docview/2165813352?accountid=11774;; 0277 Education finance , 0443 Educational evaluation , 0533 Secondary education , 0535 Reading instruction; 0277 Education finance , 0443 Educational evaluation , 0533 Secondary education , 0535 Reading instruction;; 0277 Education finance , 0443 Educational evaluation , 0533 Secondary education , 0535 Reading instruction;;; 0277 Education finance , 0443 Educational evaluation , 0533 Secondary education , 0535 Reading instruction; Education finance , Educational evaluation , Secondary education , Reading instruction; Education , Cost benefit analysis , Cost effectiveness , Productivity , Project based learning , Return on investment;;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:Education+Database&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+Cost-Effectiveness+of+Project-Based+Learning+in+Relation+to+11th+Grade+Literacy&amp;issn=&amp;date=2018-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Hart%2C+Bobby+R.&amp;isbn=978-0-438-76524-5&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/";ProQuest Central,Social Science Premium Collection

Student Development of Team-effectiveness Behaviours in Engineering Teams;"The Canadian Engineering Accreditation Board requires all graduating engineering students to demonstrate the ability to work effectively in teams. This thesis provides a response to this requirement through the development and testing of an on-line team-effectiveness learning system (TELS) for use in large 250-900 student classes. Based on Kolb’s Experiential Learning Theory and Hewson and Little’s feedback model, TELS provides students an opportunity to develop their team-member effectiveness through: i) guiding intra-team self and peer assessments of teamwork using an inventory of behaviours customised for engineering students; ii) providing students self and peer feedback to identify opportunities for improvement, and iii) providing online, integrated lessons and exercises on how to improve each behaviour within the system. The Team-Effectiveness Learning System (TELS) was developed and tested in a multi-year study of two first-year engineering design courses. A mixed-methods approach was taken to assess the efficacy of the system, combining an analysis of students’ self and peer assessments, their use of the online learning system and students’ self-reported assessments of the system’s utility. Findings from three-years of testing and revision indicate that TELS guided students to provide feedback for improvement that was reliable and that the behavioural inventory used to provide feedback expanded student discussion of relational and communication behaviours. A statistically significant improvement in students’ self and peer assessed weaknesses was seen between mid-term and end-of-term feedback. Student improvement was predominantly motivated by the feedback a student received; students who received feedback that had a greater focus on strengths and weaknesses reported being more motivated to improve their behaviour and did improve their behaviour more than those whose feedback discussed few strengths and weaknesses. Student improvement methods focused on reviewing their feedback and reflecting on how to improve their weaknesses – only 13% of students used the online lessons as scaffolding to support development. Integration of the Team-Effectiveness Learning System (TELS) into team projects in engineering education affords instructors in large classes a way to provide personalised feedback to individual students. In first-year engineering design classes it has been found to improve students’ team behaviour and expand students’ understanding of effective teamwork.";2149672602;;;Dissertations & Theses;;Sheridan, Patricia Kristine;;;" Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.";;; Dissertation/Thesis;;; 2018; 978-0-438-68251-1;;; English; English;;;;2018;ProQuest Dissertations and Theses;;2018;;;;https://search.proquest.com/docview/2149672602?accountid=11774;; 0515 Education , 0537 Engineering , 0710 Educational technology; 0515 Education , 0537 Engineering , 0710 Educational technology;; 0515 Education , 0537 Engineering , 0710 Educational technology;;; 0515 Education , 0537 Engineering , 0710 Educational technology; Education , Engineering , Educational technology; Applied sciences , Education , Engineering , First year design , Online learning , Students , Team-effectiveness behaviours , Teams;;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:Education+Database&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Student+Development+of+Team-effectiveness+Behaviours+in+Engineering+Teams&amp;issn=&amp;date=2018-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Sheridan%2C+Patricia+Kristine&amp;isbn=978-0-438-68251-1&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/";ProQuest Central,Social Science Premium Collection
Seven Principles of Undergraduate Capstone Project Management;The Agile development approach has been increasingly adopted in undergraduate capstone courses for software engineering as well as other engineering programs. Our capstone course series is designed to help students grow in three aspects: software engineering practices, teamwork, and project management. Bringing all three aspects together, in this study we have focused on the agile management of team-based capstone projects. In particular, we propose to distinguish three levels of capstone project management: base-level management, meta-level management, and cross-team management. We then refine the three levels of management into seven principles which are critical for senior students to learn in the management of their capstone projects. The seven principles have been implemented into a web-based platform, and a survey was conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of the platform in helping students practice the seven principles. The survey confirmed that students have gained quite positive experiences in all seven aspects.;2140023758;;;Conference Papers & Proceedings; School of Engineering, Behrend College Pennsylvania State University Erie, PA 16563 Email: xfan@psu.edu;Fan, Xiaocong;;; Copyright The Steering Committee of The World Congress in Computer Science, Computer Engineering and Applied Computing (WorldComp) 2018;;; Conference Proceedings;;; 2018;;;; English; English;; 106-112; Athens;2018;Proceedings of the International Conference on Software Engineering Research and Practice (SERP);;2018;;;;https://search.proquest.com/docview/2140023758?accountid=11774;;;;;;; 106;; International conferences , Students , Project management , Collaboration , Teams , Project management , Computer engineering , Design , Teamwork , Software engineering , Advisors , Core curriculum , Software engineering , Education , Learning , Students;;;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=proceeding&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Ahightechjournals&amp;atitle=Seven+Principles+of+Undergraduate+Capstone+Project+Management&amp;title=Proceedings+of+the+International+Conference+on+Software+Engineering+Research+and+Practice+%28SERP%29&amp;issn=&amp;date=2018-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=106&amp;au=Fan%2C+Xiaocong&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=Proceedings+of+the+International+Conference+on+Software+Engineering+Research+and+Practice+%28SERP%29&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/";ProQuest Central,SciTech Premium Collection

Communication - The More the Merrier;Teamwork is an important process where the project outcome relies on the positive experiences of the group. The biggest indicators of a positive team experience are communication and collaboration - soft skills affected by the social sensitivity of the group members. Communication is the largest problem in virtual teams. Prior research has found that social sensitivity influences the amount of communication and performance of traditional face-to-face teams. Virtual teams depend on online communication most due to difficulties faced by physical distribution. This research focuses on the influence of social sensitivity on the amount of communication and the performance of virtual teams. We find that teams with higher average levels of social sensitivity communicate more and perform better, even if they work in a virtual environment using only text messaging.;2139474241;;;Conference Papers & Proceedings;;"Biehl, Cydnee E;Lacher, Lisa L";;; Copyright The Steering Committee of The World Congress in Computer Science, Computer Engineering and Applied Computing (WorldComp) 2018;;; Conference Proceedings;;; 2018;;;; English; English;; 170-176; Athens;2018;Proceedings of the International Conference on Frontiers in Education: Computer Science and Computer Engineering (FECS);;2018;;;;https://search.proquest.com/docview/2139474241?accountid=11774;;;;;;; 170;; Psychology , Students , Virtual teams , Collaboration , Success , Sensitivity , Communication , Short message service , Virtual organization , Teamwork , Teams , Education , Learning , Text messaging , Virtual environments , Skills;;;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=proceeding&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Ahightechjournals&amp;atitle=Communication+-+The+More+the+Merrier&amp;title=Proceedings+of+the+International+Conference+on+Frontiers+in+Education%3A+Computer+Science+and+Computer+Engineering+%28FECS%29&amp;issn=&amp;date=2018-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=170&amp;au=Biehl%2C+Cydnee+E%3BLacher%2C+Lisa+L&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=Proceedings+of+the+International+Conference+on+Frontiers+in+Education%3A+Computer+Science+and+Computer+Engineering+%28FECS%29&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/";ProQuest Central,SciTech Premium Collection

Competency Assessment in Problem-Based Learning Projects of Information Technologies Students;The rapid development of new technologies requires a new set of skills from all users in operating, using, and maintaining digitised environments. Curriculum design in the field of Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) undergoes a rapid change as technological achievements do influence education. The aim of the article was to present research results on the mappings of learning outcomes to taxonomies to evolve from requirement-based assessment to competency-based assessment. The research was carried out on the problem-based learning (PBL) module. The article presents a novel PBL model design with activities and evaluation schema. The developed model could be used to guide the curricula design of information technologies for generic competencies, and to foster skills essential for the future ICT sector.;2133811181;;;Scholarly Journals;;"Brilingaitė, Agnė;Bukauskas, Linas;Juškevičienė, Anita";;; Copyright Institute of Mathematics and Informatics 2018;; 10.15388/infedu.2018.02; Journal Article;;; 2018;;1648-5831;1; English; English;; 21-44; Vilnius;2018;Informatics in Education;;2018;;;17;https://search.proquest.com/docview/2133811181?accountid=11774;;;;;;; 21;; Information technology , Taxonomy , Curricula , Learning , Curricula , Problem based learning , Digitization , New technology , Skills;;;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aeducation&amp;atitle=Competency+Assessment+in+Problem-Based+Learning+Projects+of+Information+Technologies+Students&amp;title=Informatics+in+Education&amp;issn=16485831&amp;date=2018-01-01&amp;volume=17&amp;issue=1&amp;spage=21&amp;au=Brilingait%C4%97%2C+Agn%C4%97%3BBukauskas%2C+Linas%3BJu%C5%A1kevi%C4%8Dien%C4%97%2C+Anita&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=Informatics+in+Education&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/10.15388%2Finfedu.2018.02";ProQuest Central,SciTech Premium Collection,Social Science Premium Collection
Digital Storytelling with Project-Based Learning: Engaging High School Males in Space Science to Improve Academic Achievement;The use of technologies in and outside classrooms has attracted young adolescents who must be prepared to embrace the opportunities and face new challenges in the 21 st century. Educational systems across the US continue to gravitate toward new technologies such as digital cameras, interactive-boards, and software that have been shown to enhance engagement. An integration of these technologies has improved the quality of education by engaging students within and beyond the classroom. Adolescent males are challenged with engagement and achievement in science according to research. This study was an exploration of the challenge of engagement and the impact of digital storytelling when implemented to improve academic achievement in a constructivist learning environment. An embedded quasi-experimental mixed methods study was conducted at an all-boys high school in Kentucky. Two selected science classes and the instructor engaged in digital storytelling. The reliability and validity of the research was enhanced by using multiple methods of data collection and analysis. Data were collected using both qualitative and quantitative methods from a sample of (n = 42) participants. Pre- and posttests, together with a survey were used to collect quantitative data. Qualitative data were collected from interviews and focus groups, which helped to determine if and how digital storytelling enhanced student academic achievement. It was concluded from this study that digital storytelling with PBL significantly improved posttest scores, and academic achievement as indicated by a statistical t -test where p = .678. Collaboration, learning strategies, and visualization of content supported learning in the constructivist environment and were reflected in enhanced student engagement and achievement. Recommendations for future research include examining an ethnically diverse population and a longer research study.;2132063209;;;Dissertations & Theses;;Francis, Marlon F.;;;" Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.";;; Dissertation/Thesis;;; 2018; 978-0-438-60490-2;;; English; English;;;;2018;ProQuest Dissertations and Theses;;2018;;;;https://search.proquest.com/docview/2132063209?accountid=11774;; 0447 Instructional Design , 0533 Secondary education , 0710 Educational technology , 0733 Gender studies , 0998 Education philosophy; 0447 Instructional Design , 0533 Secondary education , 0710 Educational technology , 0733 Gender studies , 0998 Education philosophy;; 0447 Instructional Design , 0533 Secondary education , 0710 Educational technology , 0733 Gender studies , 0998 Education philosophy;;; 0447 Instructional Design , 0533 Secondary education , 0710 Educational technology , 0733 Gender studies , 0998 Education philosophy; Instructional Design , Secondary education , Educational technology , Gender studies , Education philosophy; Social sciences , Education , Academic achievement , Adolescence , Digital storytelling , Project-based learning , Student engagement , Visualization;;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:Education+Database&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Digital+Storytelling+with+Project-Based+Learning%3A+Engaging+High+School+Males+in+Space+Science+to+Improve+Academic+Achievement&amp;issn=&amp;date=2018-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Francis%2C+Marlon+F.&amp;isbn=978-0-438-60490-2&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/";ProQuest Central,Social Science Premium Collection
"From the Pyramids via Modern CE to Automation &amp;amp; Robotics: Progress or Regress?";"Construction management courses are currently mostly based on frontal lectures, homework and exams - where the exams comprise of questions similar to the ones that the professor showed in the lectures &amp; later the student is asked to solve at home. In practice, construction engineers are required to be able to quickly resolve unstructured complex problems, under conditions of uncertainty, by finding, collecting and integrating information from different sources and providing creative solutions. We propose that a learning-centered approach to the education of the construction management student, in which s/he is confronted with the need to find solutions for such complex problems, and to identify the relevant data, will better prepare the future engineer for the profession. Moreover, the students have to be exposed to the fact that there is more than one correct solution and none of the solutions is perfect. Ethical dilemmas in particular may require construction managers to resolve problems for which they cannot rely on simple formulas. An elective course in construction management, which has been developed over the past four years, in which these principles have been incorporated, will be described.";2123611364;;;Conference Papers & Proceedings; Department of Structural Engineering, Ben Gurion University of the Negev, Beer Sheva, Israel , Retired Professor, Technion – IIT.

She Is a Computer Scientist: A Quantitative Comparison between the Effectiveness of Game Design Studios and Robotics at Enhancing Women's Learning of, Self-Efficacy in, Attitudes toward, and Domain Identification with Computer Science;"The underrepresentation of women in computer science is a serious issue with ramifications that affect not only women working in the field, but also the field at large and the national economy. While the problem is attributed to several interconnected causes, such as computer knowledge, experience, and familiarity; they do not tell the entire story, nor do they point to a global trend. Studies indicate that these factors did not stop the computer science field from achieving a balanced male-female ratio in non-western countries. Since no single factor can be attributed as the primary cause of this complicated problem, and in an effort to minimize the issue and move computer science in western countries closer toward an egalitarian model, the approach taken to enhance the representation of women in computer science needed to be multifaceted. The most common factors revealed in the literature as possible contributors to the problem were listed and categorized. Based on these factors, the study hypothesized a model (Amal’s Model) and tested its effectiveness at predicting students’ domain identifications with computer science. Following this, the study suggested and tested the impact of coupling constructionist gaming with studio pedagogy in a game design studio on students’, especially women’s, learning of, self-efficacy in, attitudes toward, and domain identifications with computer science. The results compared the implementation of the game design studio with robotics and traditional pedagogical practices. The participant body (N = 94) was composed primarily of computer science majors and non-majors who were enrolled during the Fall 2017 semester. The research design included block randomization in order to make sure that the male-female ratio was relatively balanced across all of the groups. A pre-posttest experimental design was utilized to compare students’ learning of, self-efficacy in, attitudes toward, and domain identifications with computer science in three groups: game design studio, robotics and coding, and a control group, with special attention to any gender-based differences that were revealed during the study. The data were analyzed using statistical tests and results showed that Amal’s Model was significantly effective at predicting students’ (both men’s and women’s) domain identifications with computer science. The study showed that aspects of Amal’s Model, including students’ learning of, self-efficacy in, and attitudes toward computer science, were significant predictors of their computer domain identifications with the field. The results concluded that increasing women’s domain identifications with the field, to match domain identification levels held by men, would, in turn, encourage women to pursue a degree in the field. Results from the current study showed that the game design studio had a significant impact on students’ (both men’s and women’s) learning of, self-efficacy in, attitudes toward and domain identifications with computer science when compared with the control group. When robotics was added to the comparison, the game design studio was effective at improving students’ learning and attitudes, and significantly effective at improving their self-efficacy and domain identifications from the pre-test to the pos-test. Unlike the findings produced by several other studies conducted in this area, when students in the study were asked about the suitability of the field for women, the majority of women and men involved agreed that the field is suitable for women. In analyzing the results for apparent gender-related changes in students’ learning, self-efficacy, attitudes, and domain identifications from pre-test to the post-test, it was found that both teaching approaches were effective at improving men’s and women’s learning from the pre-test to the post-test. Regardless of the differences between groups in men’s learning of, self-efficacy in, attitudes toward, and domain identification with the field, the differences were statistically insignificant across the groups. While women in the robotics and coding group had significantly higher self-efficacy beliefs than the control group, women in the game design studio showed significant improvements, not only in their self-efficacy, but in their learning, attitudes and domain identifications when compared with the control group. Even though women in the game design studio had slightly lower domain identification levels than men in the same group, they demonstrated the highest statistical improvement in their domain identification with computer science when compared to not only the control group, but also the robotics and coding group. The study demonstrated that women in the control group consistently had the lowest scores in their learning of, self-efficacy in, attitudes toward, and domain identifications with computer science. The results, including current findings and recommendations for enhancing the representation of women in computer science, and suggestions for future studies, were discussed in great detail.";2111256715;;;Dissertations & Theses;;Alshammari, Ali Nazil;;;" Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.";;; Dissertation/Thesis;;; 2018; 978-0-438-36025-9;;; English; English;;;;2018;ProQuest Dissertations and Theses;;2018;;;;https://search.proquest.com/docview/2111256715?accountid=11774;; 0447 Instructional Design , 0453 Womens studies , 0984 Computer science; 0447 Instructional Design , 0453 Womens studies , 0984 Computer science;; 0447 Instructional Design , 0453 Womens studies , 0984 Computer science;;; 0447 Instructional Design , 0453 Womens studies , 0984 Computer science; Instructional Design , Womens studies , Computer science; Applied sciences , Social sciences , Education , Computer attitudes , Computer science education , Domain identification , Game design studios , Robotics , Self-efficacy;;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:Education+Database&amp;atitle=&amp;title=She+Is+a+Computer+Scientist%3A+A+Quantitative+Comparison+between+the+Effectiveness+of+Game+Design+Studios+and+Robotics+at+Enhancing+Women%27s+Learning+of%2C+Self-Efficacy+in%2C+Attitudes+toward%2C+and+Domain+Identification+with+Computer+Science&amp;issn=&amp;date=2018-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Alshammari%2C+Ali+Nazil&amp;isbn=978-0-438-36025-9&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/";ProQuest Central,Social Science Premium Collection
Problem-Based Projects in Computer Programming: Students' Cooperation, Responsibilities and Dependencies;This research reports on second-year students who designed and developed an integrated C# programming and database project as one of the course outcomes in a problem-based environment. Project teamwork involved three key actions, namely cooperation, taking responsibility and dealing with dependencies. For these actions, several competencies were required. Based on the literature, a framework was proposed involving five categories of competencies as well as associated mechanisms to manage team cooperation, responsibilities and dependencies in joint programming projects. The purpose of the research was to test the proposed framework of competencies using the data at hand. An interpretivist approach directed this research and a qualitative methodology was followed. Ninety-nine second-year BSc Computer Science and Information Technology students participated in the research at a South African university. Students worked mainly in teams of two members and selected the partners themselves. Data collection involved weekly project sheets, which indicated a team's responsibilities and cooperation as well as their planning, design, development and reflection on project activities. The data were manually analysed. Several quotes provided supporting evidence of the proposed framework and it was validated by referring to instances of some mechanisms that team members used to manage their problem-based projects.;2101884197; EJ1184879;;Scholarly Journals;;Havenga, Marietjie;;;;; 10.1080/18117295.2018.1483596; Article , Report , 080: Journal Articles , 143: Reports - Research;;; 2018;;1029-8457;2; English; English;; 254-264;;2018;African Journal of Research in Mathematics, Science and Technology Education; Scholarly Journals , Reports;2018; http://www.tandf.co.uk/journals; ERIC, © Routledge;22;https://search.proquest.com/docview/2101884197?accountid=11774;;;;;;; 254;;  8257ER5 5901ER5  8227 5882 ,  10282ER5 9179ER5 126ER5  10240 9146 126 ,  2065ER5 5172ER5 8290ER5 3164ER5  2054 5155 8260 3150 ,  8359ER5 2064ER5 5171ER5 9385ER5 5983ER5  8328 2053 5154 9351 5964 ,  2232ER5 912ER5  2221 909 ,  4525ER5 126ER5  4509 126 ,  10293ER5 8964ER5  10251 8931 ,  11139ER5 1815ER5 10321ER5 8043ER5 4558ER5  11095 1806 10278 8016 4542 ,  10685ER5 4527ER5 912ER5  10642 4511 909 ,  8548ER5 8868ER5  8517 8836 ,  9726ER5 1ER5  9690 1 ,  4124ER5 4350ER5  4109 4335 , South Africa; Higher Education , South Africa;;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aeric&amp;atitle=Problem-Based+Projects+in+Computer+Programming%3A+Students%27+Cooperation%2C+Responsibilities+and+Dependencies&amp;title=African+Journal+of+Research+in+Mathematics%2C+Science+and+Technology+Education&amp;issn=10298457&amp;date=2018-01-01&amp;volume=22&amp;issue=2&amp;spage=254&amp;au=Havenga%2C+Marietjie&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=African+Journal+of+Research+in+Mathematics%2C+Science+and+Technology+Education&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/EJ1184879&amp;rft_id=info:doi/10.1080%2F18117295.2018.1483596";Social Science Premium Collection
Collaborative Approach in Software Engineering Education: An Interdisciplinary Case;"Aim/Purpose: This study was aimed at enhancing students' learning of software engineering methods. A collaboration between the Computer Science, Business Management, and Product Design programs was formed to work on actual projects with real clients. This interdisciplinary form of collaboration simulates the realities of a diverse Software Engineering team. Background: A collaborative approach implemented through projects has been the established pedagogy for introducing the Software Engineering course to undergraduate Computer Science students. The collaboration, however, is limited to collaboration among Computer Science students and their clients. This case study explored an enhancement to the collaborative approach to project development by integrating other related disciplines into the project development framework; hence, the Interdisciplinary Approach. Methodology: This study adopted the case method approach. An interdisciplinary service innovation activity was proposed to invite other disciplines in the learning process of the computer science students. The agile methodology Scrum was used as the software development approach during project development. Survey data were collected from the students to establish (a) their perception of the interdisciplinary approach to project development; (b) the factors that influenced success or failure of their team to deliver the project; and (c) the perceived skills or knowledge that they acquired from the interdisciplinary approach. Analysis of data followed a mixed method approach. Contribution: The study improved the current pedagogy for Software Engineering education by integrating other related disciplines into the software project development framework. Findings: Data collected showed that the students generally accepted the interdisciplinary approach to project development. Factors such as project relevance, teamwork, time and schedule, and administration support, among others, affect team performance towards project completion. In the case of the Computer Science students, results show that students have learned skills during the experience that, as literature reveal, can only be acquired or mastered in their future profession as software engineers. Recommendations for Practitioners: The active collaboration of the industry with the University and the involvement of the other related courses in teaching software engineering methods are critical to the development of the students, not only in learning the methodology but also as a working professional. Recommendation for Researchers: It is interesting to know and eventually understand the interactions between interdisciplinary team members in the conduct of Software Engineering practices while working on their projects. More specifically, what creative tensions arise and how do the interdisciplinary teams handle the discourse? Impact on Society: This study bridges the gap between how Software Engineering is taught in the university and how Software Engineering teams work in real life. Future Research: Future research is targeted at refining and elaborating the elements of the interdisciplinary framework presented in this paper towards an integrated course module for Software Engineering education.";2101386811; EJ1181267;;Scholarly Journals;;"Vicente, Aileen Joan;Tan, Tiffany Adelaine;Yu, Alvin Ray";;;;;; Article , Report , Undefined , 080: Journal Articles , 143: Reports - Research , 160: Tests/Questionnaires;;; 2018;;2165-3151;; English; English;; 127-152;;2018;Journal of Information Technology Education: Innovations in Practice; Scholarly Journals , Reports , Other Sources;2018; http://www.informingscience.org/Journals/JITEIIP/Overview; ERIC, © Informing Science Institute;17;https://search.proquest.com/docview/2101386811?accountid=11774;;;;;;; 127;;  5385ER5 6603ER5  5368 6582 ,  2065ER5 5172ER5 8290ER5 3164ER5  2054 5155 8260 3150 ,  3488ER5 8290ER5 3164ER5  3474 8260 3150 ,  1207ER5 8290ER5 3164ER5  1204 8260 3150 ,  2070ER5  2059 ,  2780ER5  2768 ,  11139ER5 1815ER5 10321ER5 8043ER5 4558ER5  11095 1806 10278 8016 4542 ,  1331ER5 8868ER5 3643ER5 6603ER5  1326 3629 6582 8836 ,  10282ER5 9179ER5 126ER5  10240 9146 126 ,  10219ER5 732ER5  10181 730 ,  6756ER5 8884ER5 6603ER5  6734 8852 6582 ,  10685ER5 4527ER5 912ER5  10642 4511 909 ,  9721ER5 5070ER5 2799ER5  9685 5053 2787 ,  4124ER5 4350ER5  4109 4335 ,  6357ER5 10713ER5  6337 10669 ,  8328ER5 2799ER5  8297 2787 ,  8332ER5 3640ER5  8301 3626 , Philippines; Higher Education , Philippines , Practitioners , Researchers;;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aeric&amp;atitle=Collaborative+Approach+in+Software+Engineering+Education%3A+An+Interdisciplinary+Case&amp;title=Journal+of+Information+Technology+Education%3A+Innovations+in+Practice&amp;issn=21653151&amp;date=2018-01-01&amp;volume=17&amp;issue=&amp;spage=127&amp;au=Vicente%2C+Aileen+Joan%3BTan%2C+Tiffany+Adelaine%3BYu%2C+Alvin+Ray&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=Journal+of+Information+Technology+Education%3A+Innovations+in+Practice&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/EJ1181267&amp;rft_id=info:doi/";Social Science Premium Collection
How Does Participating in a Capstone Project with Industrial Customers Affect Student Attitudes?;Conference Title: 2018 IEEE/ACM 40th International Conference on Software Engineering: Software Engineering Education and Training (ICSE-SEET) Conference Start Date: 2018, May 25 Conference End Date: 2018, June 3 Conference Location: Gothenburg, Sweden Teaching of software engineering using capstone projects has seen a steady growth over the years with overwhelmingly positive reported experiences. Discerning what students consider of value before and after a software project course, is crucial for developing a relevant curriculum. This paper reports on the affective learning outcomes of a Scrum based capstone course with industrial clients. We measured affective learning as changes in the attitudes towards the difficulty and importance of certain aspects present in software development, including technical, teamwork and customer interaction. Data was collected from 14 student teams of 7-9 members in the form of team interviews and individual surveys, with 86 students participating in the interviews and 86 valid survey answers. %corresponding to a 66% response rate. Our results show that students largely change their attitudes in the desired direction after the course regarding both importance and difficulty, with 57% reporting an increased understanding of the importance of collaboration and communication within the team and 44% reporting less than expected difficulty in learning new technologies/programming languages.;2096243391;;;Conference Papers & Proceedings;;"Paasivaara, Maria;Voda, Dragos;Heikkila, Ville T;Vanhanen, Jari;Lassenius, Casper";;; Copyright The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, Inc.

iSnap: Data-driven Support for Novice Programming Informed by Evaluations of Hint Quality and Investigations of Student Help-seeking Behavior;"Growing national interest in Computer Science (CS) education has fueled efforts to recruit a larger and more diverse group of computing students. These efforts frame programming as a way to create meaningful, creative and impactful artifacts. This approach has resonated with learners, and the number of undergraduate CS majors has tripled in the past decade. However, CS can be a notoriously unforgiving subject, with the highest 4-year college attrition rate of any STEM field and CS1 pass rates at 60-70%. CS students are struggling and need additional support that can scale to modern computing classrooms, especially when instructors are unavailable. I present research that addresses these challenges through the development and evaluation of iSnap, a novice programming environment that automatically supports students with next-step hints and feedback. iSnap’s help is generated using SourceCheck, a data-driven algorithm that leverages the correct solutions of previous students to guide new students towards a correct solution. SourceCheck is also designed to support longer and more open-ended programming tasks, which are popular in computing curricula for novices. iSnap integrates these help features with a blockbased programming interface, which allows students to construct programs with drag-and-drop blocks of code, minimizing the challenges of syntax. In this work I investigate four research questions, concerning: 1) the design of the iSnap programming environment; 2) the generation of data-driven programming hints; 3) how to evaluate the quality of these data-driven hints; and 4) what factors influence students’ willingness to seek and use this help when programming. I present three evaluation studies of iSnap, which address these questions. I find that iSnap’s hints are relatively high-quality, often matching human-authored hints, but that their quality can also vary considerably.My results show that when students receive lower-quality hints, they are less likely to ask for additional help, even if they are struggling on an assignment. I present methods for benchmarking and comparing data-driven hint quality, so that improvements to hint generation algorithms can be more easily evaluated. Using these methods, I show that the quantity and source of data significantly impact the SourceCheck algorithm’s hint quality. However, I also find that many students never ask for help in the first place and that a variety of factors besides hint quality impact students’ willingness to seek help. These include students’ desire for independence, their previous experiences with computer-based help, and the accessibility and salience of the help. The contributions of this work include the iSnap programming environment and the Source- Check data-driven hint generation algorithm, along with design recommendations for how to effectively integrate intelligent, data-driven support into a novice programming environment. Additionally, it contributes methods for evaluating the quality of data-driven hints and evidence linking this hint quality to students’ help-seeking outcomes. Lastly, it identifies additional factors that influence students’ help-seeking behavior and translates these factors into design recommendations for more effective programming support features. Each of these contributions informfuture directions for research on data-driven programming support, as it progresses beyond the next-step hints discussed in this work to support more complex and open-ended programming assignments.";2092320347;;;Dissertations & Theses;;Price, Thomason William;;;" Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.";;; Dissertation/Thesis;;; 2018; 978-0-438-28397-8;;; English; English;;;;2018;ProQuest Dissertations and Theses;;2018;;;;https://search.proquest.com/docview/2092320347?accountid=11774;; 0710 Educational technology , 0984 Computer science; 0710 Educational technology , 0984 Computer science;; 0710 Educational technology , 0984 Computer science;;; 0710 Educational technology , 0984 Computer science; Educational technology , Computer science; Applied sciences , Education , Advanced Learning Technologies , Automated Feedback , Automated Hint Generation , Computing Education , Educational Data Mining , Intelligent Tutoring Systems;;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:Education+Database&amp;atitle=&amp;title=iSnap%3A+Data-driven+Support+for+Novice+Programming+Informed+by+Evaluations+of+Hint+Quality+and+Investigations+of+Student+Help-seeking+Behavior&amp;issn=&amp;date=2018-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Price%2C+Thomason+William&amp;isbn=978-0-438-28397-8&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/";ProQuest Central,SciTech Premium Collection,Social Science Premium Collection
Senior Computer Science Students' Task and Revised Task Interpretation while Engaged in Programming Endeavor;Developing a computer program is not an easy task. Studies reported that a large number of computer science students decided to change their major due to the extreme challenge in learning programming. Fortunately, studies also reported that learning various self-regulation strategies may help students to continue studying computer science. This study is interested in assessing students’ self-regulation, in specific their task understanding and its revision during programming endeavors. Task understanding is specifically selected because it affects the entire programming endeavor. In this qualitative case study, two female and two male senior computer science students were voluntarily recruited as research participants. They were asked to think aloud while answering five programming problems. Before solving the problem, they had to explain their understanding of the task and after that answer some questions related to their problem-solving process. The participants’ problem-solving process were video-and audio-recorded, transcribed, and analyzed. This study found that the participants’ were capable of tailoring their problem-solving approach to the task types, including when understanding the tasks. Given enough time, the participants can understand the problem correctly. When the task is complicated, the participants will gradually update their understanding during the problem-solving endeavor. Some situations may have prevented the participants from understanding the task correctly, including overconfidence, being overwhelmed, utilizing an inappropriate presentation technique, or drawing knowledge from irrelevant experience. Last, the participants tended to be inexperienced in managing unfavorable outcomes.;2075116388;;;Dissertations & Theses;;Febrian, Andreas;;;" Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.";;; Dissertation/Thesis;;; 2018; 978-0-438-18088-8;;; English; English;;;;2018;ProQuest Dissertations and Theses;;2018;;;;https://search.proquest.com/docview/2075116388?accountid=11774;; 0515 Education , 0537 Engineering; 0515 Education , 0537 Engineering;; 0515 Education , 0537 Engineering;;; 0515 Education , 0537 Engineering; Education , Engineering; Applied sciences , Education , Case study , Programming , Qualitative , Self-regulation , Task interpretation;;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:Education+Database&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Senior+Computer+Science+Students%27+Task+and+Revised+Task+Interpretation+while+Engaged+in+Programming+Endeavor&amp;issn=&amp;date=2018-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Febrian%2C+Andreas&amp;isbn=978-0-438-18088-8&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/";ProQuest Central,Social Science Premium Collection
A Cloud-Based Mobile System to Improve Project Management Skills in Software Engineering Capstone Courses;Capstone project-based courses offer a favorable environment for the development of student skills through an approach incorporating theoretical and practical components. However, it is often difficult to successfully coordinate between students, stakeholders, and the academic team. The absence of suitable tools for addressing this issue, along with time constraints, often prevents students from attaining the expected course outcomes. This raises the question “How can we improve project management skills in computing majors through the use of technology-enhanced learning environments?” This paper presents a Cloud-based mobile system for supporting project management under a framework of best practices in software engineering capstone courses. The Kanban approach was used as a core of the proposed system. Kanban boards are very popular in the software industry today. It has been empirically shown that they provide increased motivation and project activity control due to their inherent simplicity. This helps the students and academic team be aware of the project context as it aids in preventing ambiguities, flaws, or uncertainties in the development of software artifacts.;2070114377;;;Scholarly Journals;;"Neyem, Andres;Diaz-Mosquera, Juan;Benedetto, Jose I";;; Copyright © 2018 Andres Neyem et al.

Tapping into the Leadership Conceptions of Undergraduate Women in Computing: A Mixed-Methods Study;Despite the great advances women have made in higher education, women remain underrepresented in both leadership positions and the computing major. After college, women are underrepresented across technical careers and especially in leadership positions. This study contends with these gender inequities by focusing on gender and the leadership conceptions of undergraduates in computing. This study draws from standpoint theory, undergraduate socialization, and leadership identity development theory and utilizes a mixed-methods design to explore gender differences in how students rate and develop their leadership confidence as well as the ways women conceptualize leadership and make meaning of their leadership experiences. More specifically, this study utilizes longitudinal data from computing majors and minors who completed a pretest and follow-up survey as part of the BRAID Research project. Additionally, I conducted interviews with 12 women who were recruited from the larger quantitative sample. Quantitative findings reveal gender inequities in how students conceptualize their leadership abilities, highlighting key family socialization agents, non-college experiences, and college environments that predict leadership outcomes. Additionally, qualitative findings reveal that women hold multifaceted but inconsistent definitions of leadership that reflect gender essentialist understandings of both leadership and the field of computing. Further, findings highlight the nature of how women experience sexism in group assignments. Taken together, these and other findings point to implications for future research on gender in STEM, theories of college student leadership development, and practices that may foster more equitable course environments that provide students with increased opportunities to develop their leadership and technical skills.;2056473381;;;Dissertations & Theses;;Blaney, Jennifer M.;;;" Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.";;; Dissertation/Thesis;;; 2018; 978-0-438-02129-7;;; English; English;;;;2018;ProQuest Dissertations and Theses;;2018;;;;https://search.proquest.com/docview/2056473381?accountid=11774;; 0714 Science education , 0733 Gender studies , 0745 Higher education; 0714 Science education , 0733 Gender studies , 0745 Higher education;; 0714 Science education , 0733 Gender studies , 0745 Higher education;;; 0714 Science education , 0733 Gender studies , 0745 Higher education; Science education , Gender studies , Higher education; Social sciences , Education , Computer science education , Computing education , Gender , Leadership development , Women;;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:Education+Database&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Tapping+into+the+Leadership+Conceptions+of+Undergraduate+Women+in+Computing%3A+A+Mixed-Methods+Study&amp;issn=&amp;date=2018-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Blaney%2C+Jennifer+M.&amp;isbn=978-0-438-02129-7&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/";ProQuest Central,Social Science Premium Collection
Agile projects to foster cooperative learning in heterogeneous classes;Conference Title: 2018 IEEE Global Engineering Education Conference (EDUCON) Conference Start Date: 2018, April 17 Conference End Date: 2018, April 20 Conference Location: Santa Cruz de Tenerife, Tenerife, Islas Canarias, Spain Teaching programming novices in secondary education is often described as a challenge, because student groups are often quite heterogeneous. Teachers react with special methods e.g. with individualized teaching, group work or project-based learning. As such a method for computer science education, that supports project-based learning agile projects are being discussed more recently. In the context of a design-based research work, experienced teachers have adapted and applied a theory-derived agile model in a wide range of contexts. In this qualitative case-study, we analyze 11 interviews with 6 teachers on their observations from 20 agile projects with over 400 students. The aim is to gain insight into how agile practices assist individual learning processes and how they help teachers to design and organize projects in order to support students individually. A structured content analysis shows that agile teams face similar obstacles as teams in plandriven projects, but that they can overcome them better in agile projects. Additionally, the analysis indicates that in agile projects the quantity and quality of interactions increases, which has positive effects on the construction of sustainable skills and that students furthermore are frequently involved in feedback processes and reflections, which makes their learning more goal-oriented. Moreover, the data shows that teachers can identify their students' strengths and weaknesses better and also observe their individual learning processes better throughout agile project. Based on that knowledge they can design their agile project in a way that each student is challenged systematically and purposefully.;2046275835;;;Conference Papers & Proceedings;;"Kastl, Petra;Romeike, Ralf";;; Copyright The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, Inc.

High School Students' Views on the PBL Activities Supported via Flipped Classroom and LEGO Practices;The purpose of this study was to investigate the high school students' views on instructions based on Flipped Classroom Model (FC) and LEGO applications. The case study, which is one of the qualitative research methods, was used within the scope of the study, the duration of which was 7 weeks. In order to choose the research group of the study, one of the purposeful sampling methods, criterion sampling, was used. In this context, the study was conducted with 35 10th grade high school students from two different classes. EGA (ExperimentalGroupA) consisted of 18 students while EGB (ExperimentalGroupB) consisted of 17 students. Within the scope of the study, algorithm instruction with FC and LEGO applications was conducted on EGA and LEGO applications and algorithm instruction in classroom were conducted on EGB. In accordance with the study, processes of focus group discussions and gathering data through observation were carried out. For the analysis of the data that was gathered, content analysis was performed and NVivo 8 was used. In the end of the study, the students were observed to be having great prejudices and reported negative views in the beginning of the study. Upon the initiation of the study, the prejudices and negative opinions were observed to be replaced by positive opinions. Students mentioned a great deal of educational benefits of the study. They stated that with the study, their motivation and interest in the lesson increased thanks to the implementations. Additionally in the group work, students said that they cooperated, exchanged ideas, shared tasks, took responsibility and socialized with their friends. About FC, students gave positive feedback on the communication opportunities of the atmosphere and they stated that they could repeatedly go beyond the class hours with FC, hence came prepared and saved time. Also students stated that FC atmosphere improved opportunities for teacher-student communication.;2034281700; EJ1175371;;Scholarly Journals;;"Cukurbasi, Baris;Kiyici, Mubin";;;;;; 080 Journal Articles , 160 Tests/questionnaires , 143 Reports - Research;;; 2018;;E1436-4522;2; English; English;; 46-61;;2018;Educational Technology & Society; CSAPTjournals , CSAPTreports , CSAPTother;2018; http://www.ifets.info;;21;https://search.proquest.com/docview/2034281700?accountid=11774;;;;;;; 46;;  4755ER5 9453ER5 10321ER5 8043ER5 4558ER5  4738 9419 10278 8016 4542 ,  10219ER5 732ER5  10181 730 ,  4429ER5 5281ER5  4414 5264 ,  8257ER5 5901ER5  8227 5882 ,  1063ER5 10664ER5 3241ER5 6603ER5  1060 10621 3227 6582 ,  5902ER5 126ER5  5883 126 ,  9041ER5 830ER5 10713ER5  9008 828 10669 ,  1331ER5 8868ER5 3643ER5 6603ER5  1326 3629 6582 8836 ,  8548ER5 8868ER5  8517 8836 ,  3713ER5 8884ER5 6603ER5 4558ER5  3698 4542 8852 6582 ,  2218ER5 8884ER5 6603ER5 4558ER5  2207 4542 8852 6582 ,  2014ER5 6415ER5  2003 6394 ,  4091ER5 2930ER5 4558ER5 3643ER5 6603ER5  4076 3629 6582 2917 4542 ,  7260ER5  7234 ,  10125ER5 2586ER5 3643ER5 6603ER5  10087 2574 3629 6582 ,  3187ER5 7480ER5  3173 7454 ,  5918ER5 6852ER5  5899 6827 ,  5899ER5  5880 ,  2236ER5 5901ER5  2225 5882 ,  10619ER5 5468ER5 8800ER5  10576 5449 8768 ,  2065ER5 5172ER5 8290ER5 3164ER5  2054 5155 8260 3150 ,  8359ER5 2064ER5 5171ER5 9385ER5 5983ER5  8328 2053 5154 9351 5964 ,  9540ER5 5491ER5 3643ER5 6603ER5  9506 5472 3629 6582; High Schools;;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aeric&amp;atitle=High+School+Students%27+Views+on+the+PBL+Activities+Supported+via+Flipped+Classroom+and+LEGO+Practices&amp;title=Educational+Technology+%26+Society&amp;issn=E14364522&amp;date=2018-01-01&amp;volume=21&amp;issue=2&amp;spage=46&amp;au=Cukurbasi%2C+Baris%3BKiyici%2C+Mubin&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=Educational+Technology+%26+Society&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/EJ1175371&amp;rft_id=info:doi/";Social Science Premium Collection
A Quantitative Examination of Gender Bias and Language Paradigm in the Evaluation of Source Code;Women represent 16% of the software development workforce in the United States. Simultaneously, organizations are unable to meet the increasing demands of software development and maintenance due to a lack of personnel. Gender bias influences female departure from STEM, but for software engineering the problem is possibly exacerbated by disregarded preferences for programming paradigms which impact self-efficacy. The purpose of this study examining gender bias in STEM was to determine if software source code developed by female and male software engineers is evaluated differently, to determine if code developed under structured and object oriented paradigms is evaluated differently, and to determine if there is an interaction effect between developer gender and programing paradigm. This study was framed by Social Cognitive Career Theory, which encompasses perspectives of career choice, occupational roles, and gender bias, and their impact on self-efficacy. Respondents were asked to score source code written by a fictive male or female developer, and written in an object oriented or structured programming language, for readability, quality and organization. The independent variables, gender of code author and software language paradigm, provided the basis for 2 x 2 between subjects experimental analyses examining main effects related to readability, quality, and organization, and any interaction effect. The target population for this study was software developers or students in the United States, sought via an online survey. Participants were randomly assigned one of four code examples. No interaction effect was demonstrated, but there were significant main effects related to gender of code author and quality, and related to code paradigm and readability. The overall trend suggested the fictive female author was scored higher than the fictive male author. These unexpected results support the need for further understanding of the complexities of gender related to software engineering, and should not provide a foundation for complacency in regard to improving female participation in software engineering. This extension of Social Cognitive Career Theory to software engineering may serve to influence stakeholders in understanding why female persistence and participation in software engineering remains minimal.;2030074216;;;Dissertations & Theses;;Rangel, Pamela J.;;;" Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.";;; Dissertation/Thesis;;; 2018; 978-0-355-82264-9;;; English; English;;;;2018;ProQuest Dissertations and Theses;;2018;;;;https://search.proquest.com/docview/2030074216?accountid=11774;; 0464 Computer Engineering , 0537 Engineering , 0984 Computer science; 0464 Computer Engineering , 0537 Engineering , 0984 Computer science;; 0464 Computer Engineering , 0537 Engineering , 0984 Computer science;;; 0464 Computer Engineering , 0537 Engineering , 0984 Computer science; Computer Engineering , Engineering , Computer science; Applied sciences , Gender bias , Paradigm , Self-efficacy , Social cognitive career theory , Software development , Software engineering;;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:Publicly+Available+Content+Database&amp;atitle=&amp;title=A+Quantitative+Examination+of+Gender+Bias+and+Language+Paradigm+in+the+Evaluation+of+Source+Code&amp;issn=&amp;date=2018-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Rangel%2C+Pamela+J.&amp;isbn=978-0-355-82264-9&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/";ProQuest Central
Design, development, and evaluation of a mobile learning application for computing education;The study focused on the application of the design science research approach in the course of developing a mobile learning application, MobileEdu, for computing education in the Nigerian higher education context. MobileEdu facilitates the learning of computer science courses on mobile devices. The application supports ubiquitous, collaborative, and social aspects of learning among higher education students. Moreover, the application eases access to learning resources. The paper first describes analysis, design, and implementation activities related to the development of MobileEdu. Also, the paper deliberated on the characteristics and scope of the adherence of MobileEdu to the traits and ideas of design science research. To evaluate MobileEdu in a real-life learning setting, experiment was conducted with 142 third-year undergraduate students in a Nigerian university. Besides the learning achievement of the students using MobileEdu, the study examined the impact of MobileEdu on students’ attitudes toward studying in a system analysis and design course. Experimental data were collected from pre- and post quizzes, interviews, and a questionnaire administered to students. The results of the evaluation are encouraging and showed that the MobileEdu application has a potential to improve students’ learning achievements. In addition, the pedagogical experiences of students were mostly positive and students’ attitudes toward the system analysis and design course through MobileEdu was better than those of students who studied the course via traditional methods. Finally, the study offered suggestions for how to implement effectively a mobile learning-supported course in computing curriculum.;1992979383;;;Scholarly Journals; School of Computing, University of Eastern Finland, Joensuu, Finland , School of Computing, University of Eastern Finland, Joensuu, Finland , Department of Computer Science, Modibbo Adama University of Technology, Yola, Nigeria , Department of Information Technology, University of Turku, Turku, Finland;"Solomon Sunday Oyelere;Suhonen, Jarkko;Wajiga, Greg M;Sutinen, Erkki";;; Education and Information Technologies is a copyright of Springer, (2017).

Reimagine E-learning: a proposal for a 21st learning framework;In recent years, there has been a growing debate and rise in publications about learning in its multiple forms. This variety has contributed to the richness of existing research but it has also increased, rather than reduced, the need for more clarity to advance further. Through a content analysis performed on the last twenty years of research, we aim at providing clarity about the complex definitions landscape of the most diffused 16 learning terms in the literature. We discuss their use over the years and we depict some trends. We conclude by providing a comprehensive learning framework that clarifies interactions and interdependencies among the terms. The framework classifies the terms into models, modes and methods. Through three exemplary case studies, we also show how instructional designers and instructors can apply this framework.;2306303446;;;Scholarly Journals;;"Caporarello, L;Giovanazzi, A;Manzoni, B";;; © 2017.

They address a key educational objective, provide students critical experience relevant to their future careers, allow instructors to set problems of greater scale and complexity than could be tackled individually, and are a vehicle for socially constructed learning. While all student teams experience challenges, those in fully online programmes must also deal with remote working, asynchronous coordination, and computer-mediated communications all of which contribute to greater social distance between team members. We have developed a facilitation framework to aid team collaboration and have demonstrated its efficacy, in prior research, with respect to team performance and outcomes. Those studies indicated, however, that despite experiencing improved project outcomes, students working in effective software engineering teams did not experience significantly improved individual achievement. To address this deficiency we implemented theoretically grounded refinements to the collaboration model based upon peer-tutoring research. Our results indicate a modest, but statistically significant (p = .08), improvement in individual achievement using this refined model.;2009318290;;;Scholarly Journals; School of Graduate Professional Studies, Pennsylvania State University, Malvern, PA, USA , School of Graduate Professional Studies, Pennsylvania State University, Malvern, PA, USA , School of Graduate Professional Studies, Pennsylvania State University, Malvern, PA, USA;"Neill, Colin J;DeFranco, Joanna F;Sangwan, Raghvinder S";;; © 2016 SEFI;; 10.1080/03043797.2016.1203293; Journal Article;;; Dec 2017;;0304-3797;6; English; English;; 591-602; Abingdon;Dec 2017;European Journal of Engineering Education;;2017;;;42;https://search.proquest.com/docview/2009318290?accountid=11774;;;;;;; 591;; Collaboration , Software engineering , On-line programming , Teams , Engineering education , Computer aided software engineering , Cooperation , Distance learning , Software engineering , Students , Computer assisted instruction--CAI , Teachers; Teamwork , collaborative learning , social construction , online learning , peer tutoring;;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aeducation&amp;atitle=Improving+collaborative+learning+in+online+software+engineering+education&amp;title=European+Journal+of+Engineering+Education&amp;issn=03043797&amp;date=2017-12-01&amp;volume=42&amp;issue=6&amp;spage=591&amp;au=Neill%2C+Colin+J%3BDeFranco%2C+Joanna+F%3BSangwan%2C+Raghvinder+S&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=European+Journal+of+Engineering+Education&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/10.1080%2F03043797.2016.1203293";ProQuest Central,SciTech Premium Collection,Social Science Premium Collection

A Systems Analysis Role-Play Exercise and Assignment;This paper presents a role-play exercise and assignment that provides an active learning experience related to the system investigation phase of an SDLC. Whether using waterfall or agile approaches, the first SDLC step usually involves system investigation activities, including problem identification, feasibility study, cost-benefit analysis, and preliminary project planning. These topics are normally covered during business-oriented introductory information systems courses and in more depth during systems analysis courses. The role-play case has evolved over several iterations since the 1990s, and it grew from a simple inclass exercise with informal discussion to a full-fledged assignment involving project planning and budgeting, utilizing both face-to-face and online collaboration. Specific roles include a CIO, systems analyst, and representatives from three functional business areas. The paper presents these roles, describes and gives examples of student deliverables, and discusses experiences and lessons learned using the exercise in an IS course.;1963875230;;;Scholarly Journals;;"Mitri, Michel;Cole, Carey;Atkins, Laura";;; Copyright EDSIG Nov 2017;;; Journal Article;;; Nov 2017;;1055-3096;1; English; English;; 1-9; West Lafayette;Nov 2017;Journal of Information Systems Education;;2017;;;28;https://search.proquest.com/docview/1963875230?accountid=11774;;;;;;; 1;; Teaching , Information systems , Higher education , Pedagogy , Students , Project planning , Collaboration , Computer science , Verbal communication , Case depth , Accreditation , Cost benefit analysis , Systems analysis , Teamwork , Educational technology , Feasibility studies , Feasibility studies , Skills , Cooperative learning , Role playing , Systems analysis , Classrooms , Project management , Active learning , Science education , Planning , Budgeting , Information technology , Software engineering;;;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aabiglobal&amp;atitle=A+Systems+Analysis+Role-Play+Exercise+and+Assignment&amp;title=Journal+of+Information+Systems+Education&amp;issn=10553096&amp;date=2017-11-01&amp;volume=28&amp;issue=1&amp;spage=1&amp;au=Mitri%2C+Michel%3BCole%2C+Carey%3BAtkins%2C+Laura&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=Journal+of+Information+Systems+Education&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/";ProQuest Central,SciTech Premium Collection,Social Science Premium Collection
Systematic Review of Challenges and Gaps in Flipped Classroom Implementation: Toward Future Model Enhancement;New forms of education reflect digital changes surrounding us. Blended learning becomes the essential part of the education process. Flipped classroom is a recently emerged hybrid classroom model, which engenders tremendous interest from teachers all over the world. It demonstrates the original education approach, which combine existing components in an innovative design. The core components of flipped classroom consist of transfer of knowledge part in a video form and in-class problem-based learning part through activities and group work. The combination of different teaching approaches, within one course, adjusts to different learning styles. Having taken out the lecturing part from the class, it is used for the face-to-face communication and activities. Hence, the student-teacher interaction increases, making the learning more individual, as well as, the communication in the class becomes more intensive. Most of flipped classroom experiments study their effectiveness, focusing on students' score and satisfaction. Authors describe the significantly increased students satisfaction and slightly increased score and other parameters, comparing with traditional classroom. At the same time, they highlight numerous number of challenge and gaps in design. This systematic review focus on reported gaps, drawbacks and challenges, derived from students' and faculty' feedback. The dataset is collected from Scopus. From 1256 selected articles, 49 were rigorously reviewed. The results describe the barriers for teachers and students, divided by categories. Teachers most frequently face lack of resources, lack of skills, design gaps and evaluation issues. It is worth mentioning, that limited time is a major problem. The categories of barriers for students include design issues, technical and resources. Here resources are not so important as soon as most of students have basic equipment. In addition to the barriers, results present most insightful guidelines and recommendations toward enhanced flipped classroom.;1968934931;;;Conference Papers & Proceedings; Lappeenranta University of Technology, Finland uliia.shnai@lut.fi;Shnai, Iuliia;;; Copyright Academic Conferences International Limited Oct 2017;;; Journal Article;;; Oct 2017;;2048-8637;; English; English;; 484-490; Kidmore End;Oct 2017;European Conference on e-Learning;;2017;;;;https://search.proquest.com/docview/1968934931?accountid=11774;;;;;;; 484;; Physiology , Teaching , Higher education , User training , Students , Classrooms , Active learning , Learning , Information literacy , Classrooms , Education , Instructional design , Teachers , Knowledge management , Librarians , Educational technology , Blended learning , Reference services , Research & development--R&D , Teachers , Barriers , Students , Models;;;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aeducation&amp;atitle=Systematic+Review+of+Challenges+and+Gaps+in+Flipped+Classroom+Implementation%3A+Toward+Future+Model+Enhancement&amp;title=European+Conference+on+e-Learning&amp;issn=20488637&amp;date=2017-10-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=484&amp;au=Shnai%2C+Iuliia&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=European+Conference+on+e-Learning&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/";ProQuest Central,SciTech Premium Collection,Social Science Premium Collection
Game lab: A Practical Learning Approach for Game Development;Learning through construction is one out of five projects in our Center for Excellent IT-education (Excited - http://www.ntnu.edu/excited). A course called Game Lab has been run for several years at Nord University, and has proven to be motivating and engaging for most students. This paper analyses what factors students find important within the Game Lab concept when it comes to their motivation for learning. In the Game Lab course, students are put into a situation where they have to act as an actual game company, taking on realistic industry challenges, working with actual customers and having to answer to an executive committee on a weekly basis to report on their progress. To get good grades in the course the students have to prove that they are active in the team through clear tasks and responsibility descriptions, notes on working hours, weekly follow-ups, etc. The model challenges the students in many ways. As the model has proven successful, this paper looks into what specific factors, within this project-based learning concept, seems to increase and decrease the students' motivation and learning outcomes. Based on a survey for the students, teachers and external representatives, the paper looks into what factors are more important in the success of Game Lab as a learning activity, how it should improve and how it can make impact on other similar learning activities within other educational programs. From the research it was found that social element of working together, being given the freedom to work on projects that are perceived as interesting and relevant, seeing the finalized product, being able to specialize, constructive feedback and industry relevance as motivating factors.;1967758423;;;Conference Papers & Proceedings; Faculty of Social Science, Nord University, Norway;Munkvold, Robin Isfold;;; Copyright Academic Conferences International Limited Oct 2017;;; Conference Proceedings;;; Oct 2017;;2049-0992;; English; English;; 472-479; Reading;Oct 2017;European Conference on Games Based Learning;;2017;;;;https://search.proquest.com/docview/1967758423?accountid=11774;;;;;;; 472;; Teaching , Physiology , Problem solving , Computer science , Games , Learning , Science education , Construction industry , Mathematics , Working hours , Working hours , Core curriculum , Collaborative learning , Problem based learning , Independent study , Games , Students , Learning , Colleges & universities;;;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=proceeding&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Ahightechjournals&amp;atitle=Game+lab%3A+A+Practical+Learning+Approach+for+Game+Development&amp;title=European+Conference+on+Games+Based+Learning&amp;issn=20490992&amp;date=2017-10-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=472&amp;au=Munkvold%2C+Robin+Isfold&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=European+Conference+on+Games+Based+Learning&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/";ProQuest Central,SciTech Premium Collection
Guidelines for using empirical studies in software engineering education;Software engineering education is under constant pressure to provide students with industry-relevant knowledge and skills. Educators must address issues beyond exercises and theories that can be directly rehearsed in small settings. Industry training has similar requirements of relevance as companies seek to keep their workforce up to date with technological advances. Real-life software development often deals with large, software-intensive systems and is influenced by the complex effects of teamwork and distributed software development, which are hard to demonstrate in an educational environment. A way to experience such effects and to increase the relevance of software engineering education is to apply empirical studies in teaching. In this paper, we show how different types of empirical studies can be used for educational purposes in software engineering. We give examples illustrating how to utilize empirical studies, discuss challenges, and derive an initial guideline that supports teachers to include empirical studies in software engineering courses. Furthermore, we give examples that show how empirical studies contribute to high-quality learning outcomes, to student motivation, and to the awareness of the advantages of applying software engineering principles. Having awareness, experience, and understanding of the actions required, students are more likely to apply such principles under real-life constraints in their working life.;1952536557;;;Scholarly Journals;;"Fagerholm, Fabian;Kuhrmann, Marco;Münch, Jürgen";;; © 2017 Fagerholm et al.

The use of task modeling in interactive system specification;Task modeling is undoubtedly a key step for task analysis during the development of iterative systems since it helps not only in the understanding of what users want but also in how to design for them. As a consequence, it should be considered as indispensable while specifying the requirements of an interactive system. With this in mind, we analyzed the requirement specifications of a typical interactive system which is a compulsory element of the final grade for a human-computer interaction course in two Master's degree programs at the University of Valenciennes. To that end, we decided to use an approach based on project-based learning. Sixty-three requirement specifications performed since 2010 were investigated to find out how the task modeling was represented. Moreover, suggestions concerning pedagogical improvement made by the students in an open question on the evaluation form were analyzed using the ground theory method. The results showed that since students are not required to perform task modeling by the requirement specification, they do not do so even in the case of complex interactive systems. Criticism, positive and improvement issues raised by the students were also identified. In this paper, we present a detailed analysis of this study that opens up questions about HCI education and effective learning of task modeling, and, as a consequence, its potential use in industry.;1935912964;;;Scholarly Journals; LAMIH CNRS UMR 8201, University of Valenciennes and Hainaut-Cambrésis, Valenciennes Cedex 9, France , LAMIH CNRS UMR 8201, University of Valenciennes and Hainaut-Cambrésis, Valenciennes Cedex 9, France , LAMIH CNRS UMR 8201, University of Valenciennes and Hainaut-Cambrésis, Valenciennes Cedex 9, France;"Gonçalves, Taisa Guidini;de Oliveira, Káthia Marçal;Kolski, Christophe";;; Cognition, Technology and Work is a copyright of Springer, 2017.;; 10.1007/s10111-017-0427-1; Journal Article;;; Sep 2017;;1435-5558;2-3; English; English;; 493-515; London;Sep 2017;Cognition, Technology & Work;;2017;;;19;https://search.proquest.com/docview/1935912964?accountid=11774;;;;;;; 493;; Task analysis , Systems design , Man machine interaction , Interactive computer systems; Task modeling , User interface design , HCI education , Project-based learning , Case study;;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Apsychology&amp;atitle=The+use+of+task+modeling+in+interactive+system+specification&amp;title=Cognition%2C+Technology+%26+Work&amp;issn=14355558&amp;date=2017-09-01&amp;volume=19&amp;issue=2-3&amp;spage=493&amp;au=Gon%C3%A7alves%2C+Taisa+Guidini%3Bde+Oliveira%2C+K%C3%A1thia+Mar%C3%A7al%3BKolski%2C+Christophe&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=Cognition%2C+Technology+%26+Work&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/10.1007%2Fs10111-017-0427-1";ProQuest Central,Social Science Premium Collection
An Instructional Feedback Technique for Teaching Project Management Tools Aligned with PMBOK;The management of contemporary software projects is unfeasible without the support of a Project Management (PM) tool. In order to enable the adoption of PM tools in practice, teaching its usage is important as part of computer education. Aiming at teaching PM tools, several approaches have been proposed, such as the development of educational PM tools. However, such approaches are typically limited with respect to content coverage and instructional support. In this context, an important technique is the provision of instructional feedback, which is essential in order to help the students to learn based on the evaluation of their own actions. In order to take advantage of this technique, this article proposes its employment in an Instructional Unit, being integrated into the PM tool dotProject+, providing automated feedback based on the project plan being developed with the tool. This technique has been evaluated through a series of case studies.;2039202739;;;Scholarly Journals;;"Rafael Queiroz Gonçalves;Christiane Gresse Von Wangenheim;Rossa Hauck, Jean Carlo;Giani Petri";;; Copyright Institute of Mathematics and Informatics 2017;; 10.15388/infedu.2017.11; Journal Article;;; 2017;;1648-5831;2; English; English;; 197-224; Vilnius;2017;Informatics in Education;;2017;;;16;https://search.proquest.com/docview/2039202739?accountid=11774;;;;;;; 197;; Software , Pedagogy , Project management , Feedback , Case studies , Feedback , Project management , Tools , Software;;;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aeducation&amp;atitle=An+Instructional+Feedback+Technique+for+Teaching+Project+Management+Tools+Aligned+with+PMBOK&amp;title=Informatics+in+Education&amp;issn=16485831&amp;date=2017-07-01&amp;volume=16&amp;issue=2&amp;spage=197&amp;au=Rafael+Queiroz+Gon%C3%A7alves%3BChristiane+Gresse+Von+Wangenheim%3BRossa+Hauck%2C+Jean+Carlo%3BGiani+Petri&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=Informatics+in+Education&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/10.15388%2Finfedu.2017.11";ProQuest Central,SciTech Premium Collection,Social Science Premium Collection

The use of wikis in a science inquiry-based project in a primary school;This study explored the use of wikis in a science inquiry-based project conducted with Primary 6 students (aged 11-12). It used an online wiki-based platform called PBworks and addressed the following research questions: (1) What are students' attitudes toward learning with wikis? (2) What are students' interactions in online group collaboration with wikis? (3) What have students learned with wikis in a science inquiry-based project in a primary school context? Analyses of the quantitative and qualitative data showed that with respect to the first research question, the students held positive attitudes toward the platform at the end of the study. With respect to the second research question, the students actively engaged in various forms of learning-related interactions using the platform that extended to more meaningful offline interactions. With respect to the third research question, the students developed Internet search skills, collaborative problem solving competencies, and critical inquiry abilities. It is concluded that a well-planned wiki-based learning experience, framed within an inquiry project-based approach facilitated by students' online collaborative knowledge construction, is conducive to the learning and teaching of science inquiry-based projects in primary school.;1899718333;;;Scholarly Journals; Department of Curriculum and Instruction, Faculty of Education, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong SAR, China , Faculty of Education, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong SAR, China , Faculty of Education, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong SAR, China;"Lau, Wilfred W; F;Lui, Vicky;Chu, Samuel K; W";;; Educational Technology Research and Development is a copyright of Springer, 2017.;; 10.1007/s11423-016-9479-9; Journal Article;;; Jun 2017;;1042-1629;3; English; English;; 533-553; New York;Jun 2017;Educational Technology, Research and Development;;2017;;;65;https://search.proquest.com/docview/1899718333?accountid=11774;;;;;;; 533;; Students , Collaboration , Science , Wikis , Inquiry method , Learning; Wikis , Inquiry-based learning , Project-based learning , Inquiry project-based learning , Science education , Primary education;;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Apsychology&amp;atitle=The+use+of+wikis+in+a+science+inquiry-based+project+in+a+primary+school&amp;title=Educational+Technology%2C+Research+and+Development&amp;issn=10421629&amp;date=2017-06-01&amp;volume=65&amp;issue=3&amp;spage=533&amp;au=Lau%2C+Wilfred+W%3B+F%3BLui%2C+Vicky%3BChu%2C+Samuel+K%3B+W&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=Educational+Technology%2C+Research+and+Development&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/10.1007%2Fs11423-016-9479-9";ProQuest Central,Social Science Premium Collection
PBL-SEE: An Authentic Assessment Model for PBL-Based Software Engineering Education;"The problem-based learning (PBL) approach has been successfully applied to teaching software engineering thanks to its principles of group work, learning by solving real problems, and learning environments that match the market realities.

Exploring the Role of Culture in Communication Conflicts: A Qualitative Study;"The purpose of this study was to identify religious/spiritual coping behaviors of African American women with hypertension (HTN) and explore how religious/spiritual coping influences adherence to high blood pressure (HBP) therapy in older African American women. A mixed-method research design guided this study. Twenty African American women with primary HTN were enrolled in this study using a mixed methods concurrent triangulation design. Data collection included physiologic, descriptive, and sociodemographic data. Adherence was measured using the Hill-Bone Compliance to High Blood Pressure Therapy scale (Kim, Hill, Bone, &amp; Levine, 2000), and religious/spiritual coping was evaluated with the Brief Religious/Spiritual Coping scale. Qualitative data were obtained by audiotaped interviews using a semi-structured interview guide. Descriptive, physiologic data and data from questionnaires were analyzed. Five themes emerged. (a) Feelings of dizziness, lightheadedness, and feeling sick; (b) Belief in God or a Supreme Being, (c) Prayer as the primary coping mechanism, (d) Adherence conceptualized as obedience to God's will, and (e) Need for healthcare providers to pray and provide more health information. This study provided insight into the influence of religious/spiritual coping behaviors on adherence to HTN treatment in older African American women with HTN in a rural medically underserved area. Nurses and other healthcare providers are in a key position to influence positive health outcomes in rural settings with limited resources using culturally appropriate strategies.";1894907699;;;Scholarly Journals;;"Deep, Sadia;Salleh, Berhannudin Mohd;Othman, Hussain";;; Copyright The Qualitative Report Apr 2017;;; Journal Article;;; Apr 2017;;1052-0147;4; English; English;; 1186-1198; Fort Lauderdale;Apr 2017;The Qualitative Report;;2017;;;22;https://search.proquest.com/docview/1894907699?accountid=11774;;;; References , Tables;;; 1186;; Coping , Females , Religion , African Americans , Hypertension , Cultural differences , Nurses , Communication , Spirituality , Intercultural communication , Treatment compliance , Cultural conflict , Health problems , Blood pressure , Research design , Rural areas , Older people , Medical personnel , Health services , African Americans , Data collection , Sociodemographics;;;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aeducation&amp;atitle=Exploring+the+Role+of+Culture+in+Communication+Conflicts%3A+A+Qualitative+Study&amp;title=The+Qualitative+Report&amp;issn=10520147&amp;date=2017-04-01&amp;volume=22&amp;issue=4&amp;spage=1186&amp;au=Deep%2C+Sadia%3BSalleh%2C+Berhannudin+Mohd%3BOthman%2C+Hussain&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=The+Qualitative+Report&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/";ProQuest Central,Social Science Premium Collection

Computer science in K-12 school curricula of the 2lst century: Why, what and when?;"  In this paper we have examined the position and roles of Computer Science in curricula in the light of recent calls for curriculum change and we have proposed principles and issues to consider in curriculum design as well as identifying priority areas for further research. The paper is based on discussions within and beyond the International Federation of Information Processing (IFIP) Education Community since 2012 as well as an analysis of curriculum developments in five different countries. Emerging themes have been discussed with reference to important perspectives from curriculum theory including ""powerful knowledge"" as a key element of entitlement and management of the growth of expertise. Based on this analysis we have identified areas of consensus as well as constraints, risks and issues that are still subject to controversy. There is an emerging consensus of the importance of Computer Science and the nature of its ""powerful knowledge"". Furthermore current understanding of the opportunities and benefits for starting to learn Computer Science early in primary schools has identified this early start as an entitlement and equity issue. There is a strong consensus that teacher professional development in Computer Science Education is critical for supporting curriculum change and is currently a major challenge in many countries. Other key issues include understanding how the growth of expertise affects potential structure and sequencing in the curriculum and the balance of content. Further considerations include how new technological opportunities interact with pedagogical approaches and can provide new potential for the growth of expertise.";1873281861;;;Scholarly Journals;;"Webb, Mary;Davis, Niki;Bell, Tim;Katz, Yaacov J;Reynolds, Nicholas;Chambers, Dianne P;Syso, Maciej M";;; Education and Information Technologies is a copyright of Springer, 2017.;; 10.1007/s10639-016-9493-x; Feature;;; Mar 2017;;1360-2357;2; English; English;; 445-468; New York;Mar 2017;Education and Information Technologies;;2017;;;22;https://search.proquest.com/docview/1873281861?accountid=11774;;;; References;;; 445;; Computer science , Secondary education , Curricula , Knowledge , Informatics; Computer science , Curriculum design , Entitlement , Powerful knowledge , Informatics , Primary education , Secondary education;;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aeducation&amp;atitle=Computer+science+in+K-12+school+curricula+of+the+2lst+century%3A+Why%2C+what+and+when%3F&amp;title=Education+and+Information+Technologies&amp;issn=13602357&amp;date=2017-03-01&amp;volume=22&amp;issue=2&amp;spage=445&amp;au=Webb%2C+Mary%3BDavis%2C+Niki%3BBell%2C+Tim%3BKatz%2C+Yaacov+J%3BReynolds%2C+Nicholas%3BChambers%2C+Dianne+P%3BSyso%2C+Maciej+M&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=Education+and+Information+Technologies&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/10.1007%2Fs10639-016-9493-x";ProQuest Central,Social Science Premium Collection

Version Control Open Source Software for Computer Science Programming Courses;The programming experience gained in a computer science programming course is hugely inadequate in creating the next generation of capable developers. This is because the small lines of code students write in class are not demonstrative of software development as it occurs in industry. Thus, most computer science students lack critical skills needed to be capable developers. In addition to that, teamwork is crucial in the development of new software or the maintenance of old systems. This project has built an in-house version control system using only open source products to provide students with the platform to experience collaborative development. This educational environment will instruct students on Open Source Software (OSS) community. It will familiarize students with writing large scale software code and introduce them to version control tools hugely utilized in software development. Students will experience the various aspects of software development by playing different roles while allowing instructors to easily track student activities. Consequently, students can reuse the code and artifacts as examples or basic frame works for their development. Coding projects progress can be easily tracked by the instructors and team leaders.;2139492955;;;Conference Papers & Proceedings; Department of Computer Science Jackson State University Jackson, MS 39217 , Department of Computer Science Jackson State University Jackson, MS 39217 , Department of Computer Science Jackson State University Jackson, MS 39217 , Department of Computer Science Jackson State University Jackson, MS 39217 , Department of Mathematics and Computer Science Wheaton College Wheaton, IL 60189;"Fanuel, Mesafint;Pei, Tzusheng;El Humos, Ali Abu;Liang, Xuejun;Kim, Hyunju";;" Google Inc

Interest-Based Learning for Teaching a Human-Computer Interaction Course: Media and Cognition Course;Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), which has been widely studied in scientific field, is an important component of computer science education. Generally, the existing HCI courses adopt Problem-Based Learning (PBL) or Case-Based Learning (CBL) as the primary teaching method. An Interest-Based Learning (IBL) is suggested in this paper. Our motivation for proposing this method is to address the issue that students may be lack of interest in continuous and innovative research after completing our HCI courses. In this method, students are asked to propose their own HCI projects related to their common personal interests, such as playing piano or cooking. The merit of our proposed methodology is to utilize students' individual wisdom and experience accumulated in their daily life before. Thus, they will have strong desires to make their work showing their personality in class and getting constant study and unceasing effort after class. In the three-year follow-up surveys, the student feedback shows that their interest is indeed increased by the introduction of IBL teaching method in class. Another noteworthy fact discovered is that some students did take selfinitiative to continue the perfection of their projects, even after the end of our course.;2139462108;;;Conference Papers & Proceedings; Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua Univ., Beijing, China , Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua Univ., Beijing, China , Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua Univ., Beijing, China , Intel Co., Beijing, China;"Yi, Yang;Shengjin, Wang;Jiasong, Sun;Xian, Zhong";;; Copyright The Steering Committee of The World Congress in Computer Science, Computer Engineering and Applied Computing (WorldComp) 2017;;; Conference Proceedings;;; 2017;;;; English; English;; 62-67; Athens;2017;Proceedings of the International Conference on Frontiers in Education: Computer Science and Computer Engineering (FECS);;2017;;;;https://search.proquest.com/docview/2139462108?accountid=11774;;;;;;; 62;; International conferences , Motivation , Students , Classrooms , Collaboration , Teaching methods , Computer science , Learning , Human-computer interface , Gamification , Science education , Man machine interaction , Cognition , Computer engineering , Core curriculum , Problem based learning , Motivation , Software engineering , Students , Cooking , Brazil;;;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=proceeding&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Ahightechjournals&amp;atitle=Interest-Based+Learning+for+Teaching+a+Human-Computer+Interaction+Course%3A+Media+and+Cognition+Course&amp;title=Proceedings+of+the+International+Conference+on+Frontiers+in+Education%3A+Computer+Science+and+Computer+Engineering+%28FECS%29&amp;issn=&amp;date=2017-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=62&amp;au=Yi%2C+Yang%3BShengjin%2C+Wang%3BJiasong%2C+Sun%3BXian%2C+Zhong&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=Proceedings+of+the+International+Conference+on+Frontiers+in+Education%3A+Computer+Science+and+Computer+Engineering+%28FECS%29&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/";ProQuest Central,SciTech Premium Collection
Critical Success Factors for Agile Project Management in Non-Software Related Product Development Teams;The use of agile project management methods in the software development industry is well established and researched. The purpose of this study is to understand whether agile project management methods (Scrum in particular) used successfully in the software industry are also being used in full, or in part, in non-software development industries when managing product development projects. Using an online survey instrument, data was collected from 329 non-software/IT global practitioners to identify in what industries and work functions agile project management methods are used, to find the independent variables that have a significant relationship with project success, and to determine the reasons why agile project management methods may not be used in non-software development industries. Project success was defined by 11 separate dependent variables. Of the respondents, 238 (72%) used agile project management methods to some degree, and of those, 150 (63%) used the Scrum Framework. Results from this survey show that agile project management is used in industries other than software development, mainly in manufacturing, training and consulting, research and development, and education. Four independent variables that showed significance with project success included: (1) the commitment by management with a clear vision, (2) holding daily stand-up meetings, (3) keeping task sizes small, and (4) using visual management. The main reason for not using agile project management is insufficient time to change from current methods. These findings suggest that agile project management methods are being used in industries outside of software development. Further, a small number of significant independent variables can be used to predict multiple dependent variables of project success.;2036515068;;;Dissertations & Theses;;Totten, Jeff;;;" Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.";;; Dissertation/Thesis;;; 2017; 978-0-355-80342-6;;; English; English;;;;2017;ProQuest Dissertations and Theses;;2017;;;;https://search.proquest.com/docview/2036515068?accountid=11774;; 0449 Educational leadership , 0454 Management , 0537 Engineering; 0449 Educational leadership , 0454 Management , 0537 Engineering;; 0449 Educational leadership , 0454 Management , 0537 Engineering;;; 0449 Educational leadership , 0454 Management , 0537 Engineering; Educational leadership , Management , Engineering; Applied sciences , Social sciences , Education , Agile , Critical success factors , Product development , Project management , Scrum , Stage gate;;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:Education+Database&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Critical+Success+Factors+for+Agile+Project+Management+in+Non-Software+Related+Product+Development+Teams&amp;issn=&amp;date=2017-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Totten%2C+Jeff&amp;isbn=978-0-355-80342-6&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/";ProQuest Central,SciTech Premium Collection,Social Science Premium Collection
Improving Collaborative Learning in Online Software Engineering Education;Team projects are commonplace in software engineering education. They address a key educational objective, provide students critical experience relevant to their future careers, allow instructors to set problems of greater scale and complexity than could be tackled individually, and are a vehicle for socially constructed learning. While all student teams experience challenges, those in fully online programmes must also deal with remote working, asynchronous coordination, and computer-mediated communications all of which contribute to greater social distance between team members. We have developed a facilitation framework to aid team collaboration and have demonstrated its efficacy, in prior research, with respect to team performance and outcomes. Those studies indicated, however, that despite experiencing improved project outcomes, students working in effective software engineering teams did not experience significantly improved individual achievement. To address this deficiency we implemented theoretically grounded refinements to the collaboration model based upon peer-tutoring research. Our results indicate a modest, but statistically significant (p = 0.08), improvement in individual achievement using this refined model.;2011270485; EJ1163505;;Scholarly Journals;;"Neill, Colin J.;DeFranco, Joanna F.;Sangwan, Raghvinder S.";;;;; 10.1080/03043797.2016.1203293; Article , Report , 080: Journal Articles , 143: Reports - Research;;; 2017;;0304-3797;6; English; English;; 591-602;;2017;European Journal of Engineering Education; Scholarly Journals , Reports;2017; http://www.tandf.co.uk/journals; ERIC, © Taylor & Francis;42;https://search.proquest.com/docview/2011270485?accountid=11774;;;;;;; 591;;  3488ER5 8290ER5 3164ER5  3474 8260 3150 ,  2070ER5  2059 ,  2236ER5 5901ER5  2225 5882 ,  3278ER5 3241ER5 6603ER5  3264 3227 6582 ,  3190ER5 1393ER5  3176 1387 ,  10250ER5 3700ER5 856ER5  10208 3685 853 ,  10685ER5 4527ER5 912ER5  10642 4511 909 ,  7356ER5 2085ER5 2084ER5 10719ER5 2362ER5 2526ER5  7330 2074 2073 10675 2351 2515 ,  2054ER5 1860ER5 10724ER5 1873ER5 10713ER5  2043 10680 1862 10669 1849 ,  7705ER5 10664ER5 3241ER5 6603ER5  7678 10621 3227 6582 ,  11099ER5 5074ER5 5259ER5  11055 5057 5242 ,  8195ER5 10833ER5 6468ER5  8166 10789 6447 ,  98ER5 5016ER5  98 4999 ,  10664ER5 3241ER5 6603ER5  10621 3227 6582 ,  5265ER5  5248 ,  5267ER5 3226ER5 5016ER5  5250 3212 4999 ,  4761ER5 8075ER5 3164ER5  4744 8046 3150 , Pennsylvania; Higher Education , Pennsylvania;;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aeric&amp;atitle=Improving+Collaborative+Learning+in+Online+Software+Engineering+Education&amp;title=European+Journal+of+Engineering+Education&amp;issn=03043797&amp;date=2017-01-01&amp;volume=42&amp;issue=6&amp;spage=591&amp;au=Neill%2C+Colin+J.%3BDeFranco%2C+Joanna+F.%3BSangwan%2C+Raghvinder+S.&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=European+Journal+of+Engineering+Education&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/EJ1163505&amp;rft_id=info:doi/10.1080%2F03043797.2016.1203293";Social Science Premium Collection
Faculty Adoption of Teaching Innovations that Promote Diversity and Student Retention in Undergraduate Computing;Despite a recent surge in enrollments, computer science (CS) programs in United States higher education continue to face substantial diversity and attrition problems. Faculty can ameliorate these issues by using evidence-based instructional techniques in their classrooms, but scholars suggest that most CS faculty do not adopt these practices. To better promote usage, it is necessary to understand what influences educators to become aware of, try out, and routinely use new teaching strategies. Using survey data from 821 CS faculty representing approximately 565 institutions in the United States, the studies presented here investigate three topics related to faculty adoption of innovative teaching practices. The first study assesses the current state of CS higher education, establishing that traditional instructional methods are in fact more diffused than innovative techniques among faculty. Despite minor differences between faculty types, most educators try new teaching strategies, implying that promotional efforts for innovative teaching should target all faculty. The second study examines the considerations faculty use in deciding to adopt innovations, analyzed through the theoretical lenses of Innovation Diffusion Theory and the Technology Acceptance Model 2 (TAM2). Results indicate that faculty are primarily motivated by concerns for their students, a construct largely unaccounted for in both theories. Liberal education mindset predicted the adoption of student course experience interventions, but in general, motivations were similar across innovation types. Finally, drawing on theories on obtrusive and unobtrusive control, the third study examines how organizational features influence adoption and other professional behaviors. Findings indicate the importance of teaching and research in tenuring decisions, faculty members’ tenure status, and organizational culture influence faculties’ professional activities, but only research value in tenure influenced innovation adoption. Implications for promoting pedagogical innovations are discussed.;1977461894;;;Dissertations & Theses;;Hovey, Christopher Lynnly;;;" Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.";;; Dissertation/Thesis;;; 2017; 978-0-355-51043-0;;; English; English;;;;2017;ProQuest Dissertations and Theses;;2017;;;;https://search.proquest.com/docview/1977461894?accountid=11774;; 0340 Educational sociology , 0626 Sociology , 0984 Computer science; 0340 Educational sociology , 0626 Sociology , 0984 Computer science;; 0340 Educational sociology , 0626 Sociology , 0984 Computer science;;; 0340 Educational sociology , 0626 Sociology , 0984 Computer science; Educational sociology , Sociology , Computer science; Applied sciences , Social sciences , Education , Computer science education , Innovation adoption , Student-centered learning , Undergraduate retention , Underrepresentation in computer science;;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:Sociology+Database&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Faculty+Adoption+of+Teaching+Innovations+that+Promote+Diversity+and+Student+Retention+in+Undergraduate+Computing&amp;issn=&amp;date=2017-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Hovey%2C+Christopher+Lynnly&amp;isbn=978-0-355-51043-0&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/";ProQuest Central,Social Science Premium Collection
A Study of Social Factors in Activity-Based Active Learning Classroom Correlated to Students' Performance;"Social behaviors of students play a significant role in the classroom atmosphere and also the way it impacts students’ learning interests. In addition, socially acceptable behaviors are generally preferred by students in group-based classes. But on the other hand, students’ socially disruptive behaviors lead to different kinds of problems, such as a) Interfering in classroom learning and learning environment; b) Weakening students’ respect for the academic environment; c) Impairing students’ academic and intellectual development; d) Decreasing students’ engagement, commitment and retention; e) Finally, worst case scenarios - social isolation, depression and other mental problems. Considering the issues, the study of social behaviors of students in an ABAL (Activity-based active learning) class is an important research subject. Unfortunately, not much attention has been given to the study of social factors impacting students’ learning. Therefore, in this work, we are going to study the social factors of students in an ABAL class that could impact students’ performance. In our study, we formulated and evaluated Group Cohesion score along with its traits (Goal Settings, Communication, Trust, Accountability, and Recognition), social factors (from open-ended answers) and sentiment analysis (from LIWC tool). By taking into consideration of our ABAL classroom approach, we provided results correlating these points with academic performance. In addition, we found that Trust trait and three social factors (C1, A1 and R3) collectively, had a high and positive correlation with academic performance, while the remaining factors had a less significant correlation, from the observations we have conducted in our ABAL class. However, when we analyzed data sample with a weekly comparison of student’s performance with the independent variables from our study, we found that there exists no strong correlation between them.";1977391260;;;Dissertations & Theses;;Ravikumar, Ranjith Kumar;;;" Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.";;; Dissertation/Thesis;;; 2017; 978-0-355-50941-0;;; English; English;;;;2017;ProQuest Dissertations and Theses;;2017;;;;https://search.proquest.com/docview/1977391260?accountid=11774;; 0515 Education; 0515 Education;; 0515 Education;;; 0515 Education; Education; Education , Abal , Activity-based active learning class , Correlation , Group cohesiveness , Sentiment analysis , Social factors;;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:Publicly+Available+Content+Database&amp;atitle=&amp;title=A+Study+of+Social+Factors+in+Activity-Based+Active+Learning+Classroom+Correlated+to+Students%27+Performance&amp;issn=&amp;date=2017-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Ravikumar%2C+Ranjith+Kumar&amp;isbn=978-0-355-50941-0&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/";ProQuest Central
"The Perceptions of New York City 21&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; Century School Administrators on the Implementation of 21&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; Century Learning Environments";Our educational system was designed for a time where most people were going to work in factories or farms and mobility was not high. Workers would remain in more or less the same occupation and company for many years, sometimes retiring with a financially secure future. Reading, writing, and math computation was valued and necessary at the time. Communications took place face-to-face, by mail and by phone. Having access to information meant having encyclopedias and books in print. Times have changed, the advent and very fast progress of technology has made global communications an almost instant event, leading to the availability of a talented work force at the click of a mouse and a lower cost, which is very attractive for companies. The education system is not moving at the same speed of change. For the most part we still congregate in school rooms to listen to one person deliver the content and then test the students’ retention via tests which in many cases are disconnected from life in the real world. This research looked to learn from New York school administrators from grade Kindergarten to grade 12 who are working to bridge the gap between the traditional school system and one that will better prepare students for a future that is changing rapidly. These administrators shared their experiences and plans as well as their boundless energy and desire to serve the youth of New York City and get them ready to be competitive in professions that we don’t know will be needed. Some of the themes resulting from this research were: technology, collaboration, trust, needs assessment, and teacher qualities. Technology is a necessary tool for research and communication. It is also an expensive asset that becomes out dated every few years and must be continually renewed. It is not only hardware and software that is needed, it is the intentional implementation of four skills that, while not new, compliment and support every aspect of education and the working world: collaboration, creativity, critical thinking and communication. These skills need to be deliberately taught and infused into the academic content. The need and value of trusting each other in the community is an invisible while palpable element that will support or hinder progress in schools. Administrators asking and providing the teachers with the professional development and necessary tools for them to better their craft and serve with pleasure was a theme expressed by the interviewees. Teachers who embrace 21st century skills were described as innovators, risk takers, not afraid of failing, supportive of their colleagues, and willing to learn with and from the students. Administrators have learned that change does not happen overnight, new initiatives should be pilot-tested at a small scale, and also that teachers are more willing to try something new when they are invited and offered support, rather than when they are told. This research will serve as a stepping stone for school leaders who want to step into a new exciting era of education, and do so taking advantage of the experiences of innovators and pioneers who have taken the challenge and are transforming the face of education in New York City. Trust, community, communication, support, technology, and forward thinking are at the heart of 21st century learning environments.;1975373816;;;Dissertations & Theses;;Vargas, Hector Ivan Uribe;;;" Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.";;; Dissertation/Thesis;;; 2017; 978-0-355-50406-4;;; English; English;;;;2017;ProQuest Dissertations and Theses;;2017;;;;https://search.proquest.com/docview/1975373816?accountid=11774;; 0449 Educational leadership; 0449 Educational leadership;; 0449 Educational leadership;;; 0449 Educational leadership; Educational leadership; Education , 21st century skills , Collaboration , Communication , Leadership , Learning environment , Technology;;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:Education+Database&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+Perceptions+of+New+York+City+21st+Century+School+Administrators+on+the+Implementation+of+21st+Century+Learning+Environments&amp;issn=&amp;date=2017-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Vargas%2C+Hector+Ivan+Uribe&amp;isbn=978-0-355-50406-4&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/";ProQuest Central,Social Science Premium Collection
Learning to Teach Computer Science: Qualitative Insights into Secondary Teachers' Pedagogical Content Knowledge;"In this dissertation, I explored the pedagogical content knowledge of in-service high school educators recently assigned to teach computer science for the first time. Teachers were participating in a professional development program where they co-taught introductory computing classes with tech industry professionals. The study was motivated by three questions: (1) what knowledge of computer science content, student thinking, and instructional strategies do teachers display? (2) what teaching tasks do teachers undertake when planning and implementing their lessons? and (3) how does teaching knowledge relate to the teaching tasks assumed? I conducted a year-long, collective case study with six teachers working in the San Francisco Bay region by gathering interview, questionnaire, observation, and assessment data at monthly classroom visits. Data suggest that (a) teachers know more about student difficulties than instructional strategies specific to computer science; (b) teaching tasks differ in the opportunities they provide for developing teaching knowledge; (c) the way teaching tasks support pedagogical content knowledge varies based on one’s level of content knowledge; and (d) teaching confidence and epistemological beliefs influenced instructional decisions but sometimes conflicted with external demands. The findings offer insight into the factors of practice-based training that influence the pedagogical content knowledge development of experienced teachers new to computer science. This work can inform the design of future initiatives to effectively prepare secondary computer science teachers.";1961607037;;;Dissertations & Theses;;Hubbard, Aleata Kimberly;;;" Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.";;; Dissertation/Thesis;;; 2017; 978-0-355-29630-3;;; English; English;;;;2017;ProQuest Dissertations and Theses;;2017;;;;https://search.proquest.com/docview/1961607037?accountid=11774;; 0530 Teacher education , 0984 Computer science; 0530 Teacher education , 0984 Computer science;; 0530 Teacher education , 0984 Computer science;;; 0530 Teacher education , 0984 Computer science; Teacher education , Computer science; Applied sciences , Education , Computer , Knowledge , Learning , Pedagogical , Science , Teach , Teachers;;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:Education+Database&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Learning+to+Teach+Computer+Science%3A+Qualitative+Insights+into+Secondary+Teachers%27+Pedagogical+Content+Knowledge&amp;issn=&amp;date=2017-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Hubbard%2C+Aleata+Kimberly&amp;isbn=978-0-355-29630-3&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/";ProQuest Central,Social Science Premium Collection
"Examining the Relationship Between Technology &amp;amp; Engineering Instruction and Technology &amp;amp; Engineering Literacy in K-8 Education";The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship between technology and engineering instruction and technology and engineering literacy in grades K-8. The factors identified and used for the purpose of this study were gender, socioeconomic status, race/ethnicity, and important modes of technology and engineering instruction. These factors were evaluated to determine their relationship to student achievement scores on the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) 2014 Technology and Engineering Literacy (TEL) assessment. Eight important modes of technology and engineering instruction were identified including: (1) choices people make that affect the environment, (2) inventions changing the way people live, (3) people working together to solve community/world problems, (4) figuring out why something is not working, (5) using different tools to see which is best, (6) building or testing models to check solutions, (7) crediting others for their ideas, and (8) judging the reliability of sources. These eight modes were analyzed in terms of exposure frequency to determine which level of exposure related to the highest level of technology and engineering literacy achievement. Multiple linear regression analyses were conducted to examine the relationship between independent variables and achievement on the NAEP TEL assessment. The study findings provided evidence to suggest that demographic predictors such as gender, socioeconomic status, and race/ethnicity have a significant relationship on student achievement in technology and engineering literacy. Additionally, evidence suggests that the more frequently students are exposed to technology and engineering modes of instruction, the higher their technology and engineering literacy achievement will be. Limitations of the study exist due to the use of an NAEP assessment and data. US leaders, policy makers, and educators, however, can benefit from this research when determining how to best allocate funding and resources as well as developing and extending their STEM programs within schools. Additional research in this area is recommended to determine how factors can relate to technology and engineering literacy at various grade levels and across time.;1955175322;;;Dissertations & Theses;;Mitchell, Tamarra L.;;;" Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.";;; Dissertation/Thesis;;; 2017; 978-0-355-22147-3;;; English; English;;;;2017;ProQuest Dissertations and Theses;;2017;;;;https://search.proquest.com/docview/1955175322?accountid=11774;; 0710 Educational technology; 0710 Educational technology;; 0710 Educational technology;;; 0710 Educational technology; Educational technology; Education;;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:Education+Database&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Examining+the+Relationship+Between+Technology+%26amp%3B+Engineering+Instruction+and+Technology+%26amp%3B+Engineering+Literacy+in+K-8+Education&amp;issn=&amp;date=2017-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Mitchell%2C+Tamarra+L.&amp;isbn=978-0-355-22147-3&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/";ProQuest Central,Social Science Premium Collection
Students' Collaboration Experiences of a Purposeful Group Assignment Strategy and Team Building in an Online Graduate Class;"The purpose of the study was to explore students’ collaboration experiences with and perceptions of a purposeful group assignment and team-building process in an online graduate class and gain a better understanding of effective grouping strategies in online environments. In this study, students in an online graduate class were assigned to teams based on a purposeful group assignment strategy, and then several team-building activities (e.g., developing agreed-upon group norms, having a rotating facilitator schedule, writing reflections), collectively called the collaborative strategy, are used to keeping the collaborative learning alive. The study was conducted in a web-delivered graduate level course in an education department and data were collected in the form of discussion records, student reflections on their collaborative works, and student interviews, as well as instructor’s reflections. Each of the components of the collaborative strategy provided various experiences for the students; however, outcomes of this study demonstrate that students preferred like-minded team members because having similar working styles naturally facilitated collaboration, and having similar working styles appeared to increase the level of satisfaction with the group work. It is found that although an online environment has been designed using collaborative group strategies, it is not realistic to count on these strategies alone. It is necessary to pay close attention to other factors that influence the course in general and specifically the instructional design to support collaboration. There is interplay among external factors, the planned strategies, and the students’ experiences with them. Rather than predicting certain outcomes, it may be more realistic to say that the collaborative strategy lays out a playing field. It provides kind of a framework within which people play out their own predilections.";1948877937;;;Dissertations & Theses;;Ergulec, Funda;;;" Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.";;; Dissertation/Thesis;;; 2017; 978-0-355-14541-0;;; English; English;;;;2017;ProQuest Dissertations and Theses;;2017;;;;https://search.proquest.com/docview/1948877937?accountid=11774;; 0447 Instructional Design; 0447 Instructional Design;; 0447 Instructional Design;;; 0447 Instructional Design; Instructional Design; Education , Assignment , Building , Collaboration , Graduate , Online , Purposeful , Team;;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:Education+Database&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Students%27+Collaboration+Experiences+of+a+Purposeful+Group+Assignment+Strategy+and+Team+Building+in+an+Online+Graduate+Class&amp;issn=&amp;date=2017-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Ergulec%2C+Funda&amp;isbn=978-0-355-14541-0&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/";ProQuest Central,Social Science Premium Collection
What Do Secondary Computer Science Teachers Need? Examining Curriculum, Pedagogy, and Contextual Support;The primary purpose of this study was to identify secondary computer science (CS) teachers’ needs, related to knowledge, skills, and school setting, to create more effective CS education in the United States. In addition, this study examined how these needs change based on the participants’ years of teaching experience as well as their background in CS. Participants were selected from secondary teachers who were teaching CS content in a school setting (public, private, or charter) or an after-school program during the time of data collection (between 2013 and 2016). This study followed a mixed-method research design using both qualitative and quantitative methods. The data were collected from email listserv discussions, questionnaire responses from 222 secondary CS teachers, and interviews with eight secondary CS teachers. Descriptive statistics, thematic analysis, and content analysis were used to analyze the data. Findings report the most common needs identified by teachers with regard to effective CS teaching. Participants reported the need for updating their course(s)’ curriculum resources constantly to keep up with changes in CS education practices and national standards. When CS was offered as an elective in their schools, teachers emphasized the need for increasing student enrollment. On the other hand, when CS was a required course in schools, teachers reported a high number of students who showed little interest in learning CS. Different pedagogical needs were discussed in different contexts. The most common pedagogical need expressed was learning student-centered strategies for teaching CS and guiding students’ understanding with the use of scaffolding and team-management strategies. Administrators and parents were reported as the main stakeholders in CS education practices, and teachers reported improving these stakeholders’ understanding of CS as a need to increase collaboration toward improving CS education practices in their schools. Many secondary CS teachers also shared the need for a community of CS teachers in their district. Even though resources for computer labs (equipment, software, and network) did not appear as a common need, a group of teachers did list resources as a crucial need in their teaching context. Findings also revealed that secondary CS teachers have a variety of different backgrounds and years of teaching experience, and teachers reported different needs based on their experience.;1947043207;;;Dissertations & Theses;;Sadik, Olgun;;;" Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.";;; Dissertation/Thesis;;; 2017; 978-0-355-14626-4;;; English; English;;;;2017;ProQuest Dissertations and Theses;;2017;;;;https://search.proquest.com/docview/1947043207?accountid=11774;; 0515 Education , 0530 Teacher education , 0984 Computer science; 0515 Education , 0530 Teacher education , 0984 Computer science;; 0515 Education , 0530 Teacher education , 0984 Computer science;;; 0515 Education , 0530 Teacher education , 0984 Computer science; Education , Teacher education , Computer science; Applied sciences , Education , Computer science education , Computing education , Curriculum , Pedagogy , Teacher education , Teacher needs;;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:Education+Database&amp;atitle=&amp;title=What+Do+Secondary+Computer+Science+Teachers+Need%3F+Examining+Curriculum%2C+Pedagogy%2C+and+Contextual+Support&amp;issn=&amp;date=2017-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Sadik%2C+Olgun&amp;isbn=978-0-355-14626-4&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/";ProQuest Central,Social Science Premium Collection
Bringing Computational Thinking to K-12 and Higher Education;Since the introduction of new curriculum standards at K-12 schools, computational thinking has become a major research area. Creating and delivering content to enhance these skills, as well as evaluation, remain open problems. This work describes different interventions based on the Scratch programming language aimed toward improving student self-efficacy in computer science and computational thinking. These interventions were applied at a STEM outreach program for 5 th -9 th grade students. Previous experience in STEM-related activities and subjects, as well as student self-efficacy, were surveyed using a developed pre- and post-survey. The impact of these interventions on student performance and confidence, as well as the validity of the instrument are discussed. To complement attitude surveys, a translation of Scratch to Blockly is proposed. This will record student programming behaviors for quantitative analysis of computational thinking in support of student self-efficacy. Outreach work with Kansas Starbase, as well as the Girl Scouts of the USA, is also described and evaluated. A key goal for computational thinking in the past 10 years has been to bring computer science to other disciplines. To test the gap from computer science to STEM, computational thinking exercises were embedded in an electromagnetic fields course. Integrating computation into theory courses in physics has been a curricular need, yet there are many difficulties and obstacles to overcome in integrating with existing curricula and programs. Recommendations from this experimental study are given towards integrating CT into physics a reality. As part of a continuing collaboration with physics, a comprehensive system for automated extraction of assessment data for descriptive analytics and visualization is also described.;1925537965;;;Dissertations & Theses;;Weese, Joshua Levi;;;" Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.";;; Dissertation/Thesis;;; 2017; 978-0-355-05088-2;;; English; English;;;;2017;ProQuest Dissertations and Theses;;2017;;;;https://search.proquest.com/docview/1925537965?accountid=11774;; 0710 Educational technology , 0984 Computer science; 0710 Educational technology , 0984 Computer science;; 0710 Educational technology , 0984 Computer science;;; 0710 Educational technology , 0984 Computer science; Educational technology , Computer science; Applied sciences , Education , Computational thinking;;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:Education+Database&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Bringing+Computational+Thinking+to+K-12+and+Higher+Education&amp;issn=&amp;date=2017-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Weese%2C+Joshua+Levi&amp;isbn=978-0-355-05088-2&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/";ProQuest Central,Social Science Premium Collection
The Perceptions of STEM from Eighth-Grade African-American Girls in a High-Minority Middle School;Even with the existence of STEM curriculum and STEM programs that target women and minorities, African-American females still lag behind other ethnic groups in STEM fields. Reasons for the underrepresentation of females in STEM fields can be traced back to the early years of schooling. The purpose of this study was to identify the factors that impact African-American females’ perspectives of STEM subjects and STEM careers. An explanatory sequential mixed-methods approach was used for data collection with a survey, focus group, and interview. Forty male (N=12) and female (N=28) students from different ethnic groups were surveyed. The focus group and interview sessions consisted of 21 African-American females from two distinct groups: those enrolled in the school’s STEM program (STEM) and those who were not enrolled in the STEM program (Non-STEM). The self-efficacy theory and social cognitive career theory served as the theoretical constructs guiding the data analysis. Multiple regression results showed that outcome expectation and personal disposition had the greatest influence on the females’ interest in STEM content and STEM careers. Results from the qualitative portion of the study revealed that the learning environment and STEM self-efficacy had a significant impact on African-American females’ interest in STEM.;1920187843;;;Dissertations & Theses;;Hare, LaChanda N.;;;" Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.";;; Dissertation/Thesis;;; 2017; 978-1-369-83575-5;;; English; English;;;;2017;ProQuest Dissertations and Theses;;2017;;;;https://search.proquest.com/docview/1920187843?accountid=11774;; 0280 Mathematics education , 0296 African American Studies , 0450 Middle School education , 0714 Science education; 0280 Mathematics education , 0296 African American Studies , 0450 Middle School education , 0714 Science education;; 0280 Mathematics education , 0296 African American Studies , 0450 Middle School education , 0714 Science education;;; 0280 Mathematics education , 0296 African American Studies , 0450 Middle School education , 0714 Science education; Mathematics education , African American Studies , Middle School education , Science education; Social sciences , Education , African Americans , Project-based learning , Science and math self-efficacy , Stem education , Stereotype threat , Twenty-first century learning skills;;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:Education+Database&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+Perceptions+of+STEM+from+Eighth-Grade+African-American+Girls+in+a+High-Minority+Middle+School&amp;issn=&amp;date=2017-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Hare%2C+LaChanda+N.&amp;isbn=978-1-369-83575-5&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/";ProQuest Central,Social Science Premium Collection
What Can Students Get from a Software Engineering Capstone Course?;Conference Title: 2017 IEEE/ACM 39th International Conference on Software Engineering: Software Engineering Education and Training Track (ICSE-SEET) Conference Start Date: 2017, May 20 Conference End Date: 2017, May 28 Conference Location: Buenos Aires, Argentina For the last ten years we have been teaching a capstone course for fifth year students of the Computer Science Department of the Universidad de Chile. Five year ago we redesigned the course, shifting from projects following a waterfall process and focused on technical aspects, to one centered in soft skills following agile practices. Since then, we provide out students a concrete learning outcome: to internalize how relevant is having and developing critical soft skills to succeed in projects. Last year, we wondered whether our students were actually getting what we declared. We conducted a survey on students' initial and final perception about the relative value and difficulty of different dimensions involved in their projects: technical challenge, teamwork, planning, and negotiation with the client. Also, we applied a one-tailed dependent pair sample t-test to determine the statistical significance of the surveys result. We found out that the relative value of soft skills grows while that of the technical challenge drops, and that the students find that planning and teamwork are harder than they expected. Also, we found statistically significant evidence that, for the soft skills we have measured, the perceived relative relevance actually changes throughout the course.;1916535971;;;Conference Papers & Proceedings;;"Bastarrica, Maria Cecilia;Perovich, Daniel;Samary, Maira Marques";;; Copyright The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, Inc.

The Effect of a Middle School STEM Initiative on Cognitive and Non-Cognitive Outcomes: A Quasi-Experimental Study using Instrumental Variables and Inverse Propensity Weights;"Science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education is an instructional framework designed to increase students’ engagement and achievement in the STEM disciplines (Anderson, 2010; Bybee, 2013). This study is an evaluation of a STEM initiative in Wake County Public School System in North Carolina. The purpose of this study is to estimate the causal effect of the STEM initiative on middle school students’ cognitive and non-cognitive outcomes using instrumental variable analysis and inverse propensity weights. It was hypothesized that the STEM initiative would increase students’ cognitive outcomes (i.e., state standardized test scores in science, mathematics, and language arts) and non-cognitive outcomes (i.e., grit, civic engagement, future goals and aspirations, control and relevancy of coursework, peer support, and attendance at school). Grade 8 outcomes were examined near the end of the 2014-15 and 2015-16 school years for 15,840 students who either attended middle schools implementing the STEM initiative or business as usual during Grades 6-8. Results indicate that students’ science achievement was lower at STEM initiative schools ( d = -.19) with statistically significant effects for students who were female ( d = -.18), male ( d = -.20), Hispanic ( d = -.18), and AIG ( d = -.26), which was not a desired consequence of the initiative. The STEM initiative contributed to a decrease in unexcused absences ( d = -.03) with a larger effect size for students who were limited English proficient (LEP) ( d = -.23), which suggests that students may have been more engaged with school at treated schools (Holt &amp; Gershenson, 2015). Otherwise, moderate to large effect sizes were not observed for students who belonged to subgroups at STEM initiative schools with four exceptions. At STEM initiative schools: (a) LEP students’ reading achievement was higher ( d = .15); (b) Black students indicated more grit ( d = .20); (c) Hispanic students indicated more control and relevance of coursework ( d = .21); and (d) AIG and White students indicated decreased civic engagement ( d = -.23 and d = -.12 respectively). Three schools were identified as medium or high implementing schools based on interviews with the school-based STEM coordinator and school-related documents. Students at these schools demonstrated higher reading achievement and increased attendance as measured by unexcused absences, but the effect sizes were small ( d = .00 and d = -.02 respectively). At medium or high implementing schools, four outcomes exhibited moderate effect sizes, showing that STEM initiative students demonstrated: (a) lower mathematics achievement ( d = -.28); (b) lower science achievement ( d = -.16); (c) lower future goals and aspirations ( d = -.20); and (d) lower control and relevance of coursework ( d = -.25). Collectively, these results suggest that the STEM initiative in middle schools contributes to higher student engagement as measured by attendance and reading achievement. Students at medium or high implementing treated schools demonstrated lower mathematics and science achievement, which suggests that teachers may use the instructional components of the STEM initiative (e.g., project-based learning, “the 4Cs”, community and industry connections) without careful attention to accurate content. The initiative was highly contextualized at each school, making it difficult to study the impact of the intervention as a whole. The development and adoption of common curriculum and assessments would greatly contribute to clarifying and defining what the STEM initiative ought to look like in schools. In addition, this study raises some interesting questions for future research. For example, the reasons why Black students demonstrated more grit and Hispanic students indicated more control and relevance of coursework at STEM initiative schools is promising for the initiative and should be further investigated.";1912805487;;;Dissertations & Theses;;Adams, Elizabeth Lynn;;;" Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.";;; Dissertation/Thesis;;; 2017; 978-1-369-85550-0;;; English; English;;;;2017;ProQuest Dissertations and Theses;;2017;;;;https://search.proquest.com/docview/1912805487?accountid=11774;; 0443 Educational evaluation , 0450 Middle School education , 0458 Education Policy; 0443 Educational evaluation , 0450 Middle School education , 0458 Education Policy;; 0443 Educational evaluation , 0450 Middle School education , 0458 Education Policy;;; 0443 Educational evaluation , 0450 Middle School education , 0458 Education Policy; Educational evaluation , Middle School education , Education Policy; Education , Instrumental variables , Non-cognitive skills , Project-based learning , Propensity score matching , Stcm education;;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:Education+Database&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+Effect+of+a+Middle+School+STEM+Initiative+on+Cognitive+and+Non-Cognitive+Outcomes%3A+A+Quasi-Experimental+Study+using+Instrumental+Variables+and+Inverse+Propensity+Weights&amp;issn=&amp;date=2017-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Adams%2C+Elizabeth+Lynn&amp;isbn=978-1-369-85550-0&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/";ProQuest Central,Social Science Premium Collection
Evaluating Intention to Use Remote Robotics Experimentation in Programming Courses;The Digital Agenda for Europe (2015) states that there will be 825,000 unfilled vacancies for Information and Communications Technology by 2020. This lack of IT professionals stems from the small number of students graduating in computer science. To retain more students in the field, teachers can use remote robotic experiments to explain difficult concepts. This correlational study used the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT) to examine if performance expectancy, effort expectancy, social influence, and facilitating conditions can predict the intention of high school computer science teachers in Cyprus, to use remote robotic experiments in their classes. Surveys, based on the UTAUT survey instrument, were collected from 90 high school computer science teachers in Cyprus, and a multiple regression analysis was used to measure the correlations between the constructs and finally the model fit of the analysis. The model was able to predict approximately 35% of the variation of the teachers’ intent to use remote robotic experiments. The biggest predictor was facilitating conditions followed by effort expectancy. Performance expectancy had little impact, whereas social influence had no impact on the intention of high school teachers to use remote robotic experiments in their classes. These results can help curriculum decision makers in the Ministry of Education in Cyprus to examine what factors affect the acceptance of remote robotic experiments and develop them in ways that would increase their implementation in high schools. By incorporating remote robotic experiments in high schools, students may learn difficult concepts, leading to an increase in computer science graduates and ultimately an increase in IT professionals.;1904513566;;;Dissertations & Theses;;Cheng, Pericles L.;;;" Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.";;; Dissertation/Thesis;;; 2017; 978-1-369-71920-8;;; English; English;;;;2017;ProQuest Dissertations and Theses;;2017;;;;https://search.proquest.com/docview/1904513566?accountid=11774;; 0489 Information Technology , 0710 Educational technology , 0771 Robotics; 0489 Information Technology , 0710 Educational technology , 0771 Robotics;; 0489 Information Technology , 0710 Educational technology , 0771 Robotics;;; 0489 Information Technology , 0710 Educational technology , 0771 Robotics; Information Technology , Educational technology , Robotics; Applied sciences , Education , Educational robotics , Problem-based learning , Remote robotics experiments , UTAUT;;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:Education+Database&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Evaluating+Intention+to+Use+Remote+Robotics+Experimentation+in+Programming+Courses&amp;issn=&amp;date=2017-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Cheng%2C+Pericles+L.&amp;isbn=978-1-369-71920-8&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/";ProQuest Central,Social Science Premium Collection
A Phenomenological Examination of Virtual Game Developers' Experiences Using Jacob's Ladder Pre-Production Design Tactic;Edutainment refers to curriculum and instruction designed with a clear educational purpose, including multi-faceted virtual learning game design. Tools such as the Jacob’s Ladder pre-production design tactic have been developed to ensure that voices of both engineers and educators are heard. However, it is unclear how development team members experience and perceive their collaborative work while designing a virtual game using such tactics. This phenomenological study examined the experiences of agile software team members using Jacob's Ladder pre-production design as an interdisciplinary collaboration tool while designing a virtual learning game. Seven design team members (3 educators and 4 engineers) participated in semi-structured interviews and transcripts were analyzed via an inductive coding process that led to the development of key themes. Findings indicated that using Jacob’s Ladder design tactic influenced the experience of the team by keeping the team focused on common goals and learner needs, organizing the team work, supporting interdisciplinary collaboration, and promoting shared understandings of the software platform limitations. Individuals played various roles, appreciated diverse views, recognized prior experience and idea sharing, and felt the design tactic supported flexibility for interdisciplinary collaboration. By linking integration strategies to interdisciplinary collaboration, findings from this study may be used by organizational leaders to consider best practices in team building for virtual learning game design, which will further support the development of effective games and growth of the edutainment industry.;1885114709;;;Dissertations & Theses;;Brown-Turner, Jasmine;;;" Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.";;; Dissertation/Thesis;;; 2017; 978-1-369-68968-6;;; English; English;;;;2017;ProQuest Dissertations and Theses;;2017;;;;https://search.proquest.com/docview/1885114709?accountid=11774;; 0447 Instructional Design , 0710 Educational technology; 0447 Instructional Design , 0710 Educational technology;; 0447 Instructional Design , 0710 Educational technology;;; 0447 Instructional Design , 0710 Educational technology; Instructional Design , Educational technology; Education , Educational games , Edutainment , Game-based learning , Instructional design , STEM;;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:Education+Database&amp;atitle=&amp;title=A+Phenomenological+Examination+of+Virtual+Game+Developers%27+Experiences+Using+Jacob%27s+Ladder+Pre-Production+Design+Tactic&amp;issn=&amp;date=2017-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Brown-Turner%2C+Jasmine&amp;isbn=978-1-369-68968-6&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/";ProQuest Central,Social Science Premium Collection
Designing the Game: How a Project-Based Media Production Program Approaches STEAM Career Readiness for Underrepresented Young Adults;Numerous studies have indicated a need for a diverse workforce that is more highly educated in STEM and ICT fields, and one that is capable of responding creatively to demands for continual innovation. This paper, in response, chronicles the implementation of the Digital Pathways (DP) program, a two-time ITEST recipient and an ongoing initiative of the Bay Area Video Coalition. DP has provided low-income, underrepresented minority young people with 180 contact hours of activities in digital media production to prepare them to pursue higher education and technology careers. A design-based research approach synthesizes staff interviews with student observations, interviews and artifacts to identify a set of generalizable best practices or design principles for empowering young people to move from being consumers of digital media to producers. These principles are illustrated with a case study of the 3D Animation and Gaming track from the second ITEST grant. Researchers argue for the importance of attending to the noncognitive elements of learning and illustrate ways in which instructors encouraged creative expression, personal agency, and collaboration through long-term projects. They also identify strategies for sustaining young people’s participation through the establishment of a supportive community environment.;2259581741;;;Scholarly Journals; Rockman et al, San Francisco, CA, USA , Bay Area Video Coalition, San Francisco, CA, USA , Rockman et al, San Francisco, CA, USA;"Bass, Kristin M;Ingrid Hu Dahl;Panahandeh, Shirin";;; Journal of Science Education and Technology is a copyright of Springer, (2016).

An Embedded Systems Course for Engineering Students Using Open-Source Platforms in Wireless Scenarios;"This paper presents a case study analyzing the advantages and disadvantages of using project-based learning (PBL) combined with collaborative learning (CL) and industry best practices, integrated with information communication technologies, open-source software, and open-source hardware tools, in a specialized microcontroller and embedded systems engineering Master's course. In addition to addressing industry requirements in both contents and methodology, the course develops capabilities and competencies in problem solving, independent learning, teamwork, and technical knowledge. Since PBL methodology alone does not ensure teamwork, it was complemented with CL. Design review meetings (as described in IEC 61160), deliverables, and organizational resources were also introduced to mirror industry demands. This structure integrated course content and student academic achievement in a simulated industrial environment. The course had students build a modular management system for home appliances, implementing control software on the ""Arduino"" open-source platform, as well as using wireless communications. The results show that teaching, learning, and student assessment processes can be improved by using PBL with CL. In addition, the introduction of industry practices, such us peer review meetings, brings academia closer to a real-world context.";1913347896; EJ1142718;;Scholarly Journals;;"Rodriguez-Sanchez, M.

Blending an Android development course with software engineering concepts;  The tremendous popularity of mobile computing and Android in particular has attracted millions of developers who see opportunities for building their own start-ups. As a consequence Computer Science students express an increasing interest into the related technology of Java development for Android applications. Android projects are complex by nature and relatively large software products while their development calls for the application of established software engineering practices and tools. However, most software engineering courses focus on 'conventional' software development for desktop or web applications. In this paper we report on the design, implementation and assessment of a novel short course aiming at bridging the gap between software engineering and Android development. The goal is to demonstrate the need for applying software engineering principles on Android development as well as to emphasize that writing software for mobile devices should be regarded as an equally serious programming activity. The proposed course covers design principles, patterns, metrics, refactorings and collaborative software development. The course has been delivered to three groups of undergraduate and postgraduate students at two different institutes. The course has been evaluated: a) by performing a student satisfaction survey, b) through summative assessment of students' performance, c) by investigating whether the proposed course modified the students' career interests and d) by employing assessment by peers based on rubrics. The results indicate that such a short course is capable of increasing student's interest on Android development as well as their awareness of the importance of software engineering concepts on mobile application software development.;1812705719;;;Scholarly Journals;;"Chatzigeorgiou, Alexander;Theodorou, Tryfon L;Violettas, George E;Xinogalos, Stelios";;; Springer Science+Business Media New York 2016;; 10.1007/s10639-015-9423-3; Feature;;; Nov 2016;;1360-2357;6; English; English;; 1847-1875; New York;Nov 2016;Education and Information Technologies;;2016;;;21;https://search.proquest.com/docview/1812705719?accountid=11774;;;; References;;; 1847;; Software engineering , Operating systems , Technology education; Software engineering , Android development , Teaching strategies , Classroom teaching;;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aeducation&amp;atitle=Blending+an+Android+development+course+with+software+engineering+concepts&amp;title=Education+and+Information+Technologies&amp;issn=13602357&amp;date=2016-11-01&amp;volume=21&amp;issue=6&amp;spage=1847&amp;au=Chatzigeorgiou%2C+Alexander%3BTheodorou%2C+Tryfon+L%3BViolettas%2C+George+E%3BXinogalos%2C+Stelios&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=Education+and+Information+Technologies&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/10.1007%2Fs10639-015-9423-3";ProQuest Central,Social Science Premium Collection
Competition and Collaboration Using a Social and Gamified Online Learning Platform;"  Gamification is defined as the use of game techniques in a non-game context and has demonstrated potential impact in a wide range of subjects. Informed by the design and processes of digital gaming, gamification often exploits competition to motivate, personified by points, badges and leader boards. Success, however, seems to go beyond these basic features and rely on a concrete acknowledgement of the motivational model of the user, taking into account concepts such as situational relevance and situated motivational affordance, which can be framed under competition and/or collaboration. This paper investigates the impact of competitive and collaborative environments on summative assessment. This study bases its investigation on the StarQuest platform (http://starquest.eu/), a social and gamified collaboration application hosting a private online environment for small groups of individuals to co-curate and share digital contents. Participants were second year undergraduate students (Sport Psychology, n=94), who enrolled on a module entitled ""A Fundamental Approach to Motor Learning and Control"". The module ran for 11 weeks and the curriculum was delivered using a Problem-Based Learning (PBL) approach. The results highlighted a number of strengths and weaknesses of implementing a gamified online platform for team working, which will inform future design, development and deployment of gamified and learning platforms.";1859715029;;;Conference Papers & Proceedings;;"Arnab, Sylvester;Bhakta, Roy;Merry, Sarah Kate;Smith, Mike;Star, Kam;Duncan, Michael";;; Copyright Academic Conferences International Limited Oct 2016;;; Feature;;; Oct 2016;;2049-0992;; English; English;; 19-26; Reading;Oct 2016;European Conference on Games Based Learning;;2016;;;;https://search.proquest.com/docview/1859715029?accountid=11774;;;; References , Diagrams;;; 19;; Collaboration , Online instruction , Students , Studies , Social networks , Design , Distance learning , Electronic games , Gamification , Cultural heritage , Web 2.0;;;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Ahightechjournals&amp;atitle=Competition+and+Collaboration+Using+a+Social+and+Gamified+Online+Learning+Platform&amp;title=European+Conference+on+Games+Based+Learning&amp;issn=20490992&amp;date=2016-10-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=19&amp;au=Arnab%2C+Sylvester%3BBhakta%2C+Roy%3BMerry%2C+Sarah+Kate%3BSmith%2C+Mike%3BStar%2C+Kam%3BDuncan%2C+Michael&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=European+Conference+on+Games+Based+Learning&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/";ProQuest Central,SciTech Premium Collection
A Full Flip: One Catholic University’s Journey with Campus-Wide Flipped Instruction;A campus-wide flipped curriculum model was initiated at a new, private, Catholic university in a large southwestern suburb. The design and development of the curriculum is presented. A formative evaluation was conducted mid-semester to determine the effectiveness of the initiative. Surveys and interviews were conducted with both faculty and students and classroom observations were conducted. Results from the evaluation indicate that students and faculty like the flipped model and that the students have a high level of engagement with the instructional content. Areas for improvement include organization of course materials and the inclusion of pre-recorded lectures. Further training support for faculty and academic support for first-year students is also recommended.;1844969220;;;Scholarly Journals;;Carrie Lewis Miller;;; Copyright Journal of Catholic Education, Loyola Marymount University Oct 2016;; 10.15365/joce.2001032016; Journal Article;;; Oct 2016;;;1; English; English;; 56-85; Los Angeles;Oct 2016;Journal of Catholic Education;;2016;;;20;https://search.proquest.com/docview/1844969220?accountid=11774;;;;;;; 56;; Curricula , Catholic schools , College students , Colleges & universities , Instructional design;;;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Areligion&amp;atitle=A+Full+Flip%3A+One+Catholic+University%26rsquo%3Bs+Journey+with+Campus-Wide+Flipped+Instruction&amp;title=Journal+of+Catholic+Education&amp;issn=&amp;date=2016-10-01&amp;volume=20&amp;issue=1&amp;spage=56&amp;au=Carrie+Lewis+Miller&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=Journal+of+Catholic+Education&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/10.15365%2Fjoce.2001032016";ProQuest Central,Social Science Premium Collection
Integrating Apple iPads into University Computing Courses;  The use of mobile devices is becoming increasingly common in both society and in the K-12 environment. Products such as the Apple iPad and the Microsoft Surface, among others, have matured to a point where university faculty are striving to integrate this increasingly ubiquitous technology into the classroom and the curriculum. This paper represents a case study examining one attempt to integrate the use of tablets into five university-level computing courses during the 2015-2016 academic year. The author used a set of iPads and accompanying classroom technology (e.g. Apple TV, keyboards) in an attempt to engage students and build their problem-solving and collaborative skills. Student feedback suggests that students were engaged, and the results for the iPad's impact on problem-solving and collaborative skills improved over the course of the year. A number of challenges were observed, including inadequate student knowledge of tablets, wireless connectivity issues, student resistance to the group learning afforded by the iPads, and keeping the tablets charged and clean. Future plans for the study intend to address the challenges uncovered, using student and instructor feedback as an impetus for future development. This paper serves as an experiential report designed to inform other faculty who may be looking into similar projects.;1886771809;;;Scholarly Journals;;Stone, Jeffrey A;;; Copyright Modern Education and Computer Science Press Sep 2016;;; Feature;;; Sep 2016;;2075-0161;9; English; English;; n/a; Hong Kong;Sep 2016;International Journal of Modern Education and Computer Science;;2016;;;8;https://search.proquest.com/docview/1886771809?accountid=11774;;;; References;;; 1;; Portable computers , Technology education , Higher education , Online instruction; iPads , Tablets , Information Science Education , Computer Science Education , Case Studies;;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aeducation&amp;atitle=Integrating+Apple+iPads+into+University+Computing+Courses&amp;title=International+Journal+of+Modern+Education+and+Computer+Science&amp;issn=20750161&amp;date=2016-09-01&amp;volume=8&amp;issue=9&amp;spage=1&amp;au=Stone%2C+Jeffrey+A&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=International+Journal+of+Modern+Education+and+Computer+Science&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/";ProQuest Central,SciTech Premium Collection,Social Science Premium Collection
Interdisciplinarity in Entrepreneurship Education: A Conceptual Framework Focusing on Pedagogy for Innovation;  This paper articulates a conceptual framework for exploring how interdisciplinarity connects with entrepreneurship education. The framework offered in this paper links the themes of entrepreneurship, innovation and pedagogy together with a focus on exploring how interdisciplinary methods of teaching can support educational outcomes in entrepreneurship education. Based on the on-going research conducted within the LAB research group at the Oulu University of Applied Sciences in Finland, this conceptual paper summarizes and integrates relevant concepts to construct a theoretical grounding for entrepreneurship education that targets innovation and real-world business development (Potter, 2008). Specifically, this framework draws upon existing concepts such as project-based learning (Blumenfeld et al, 1991), self-regulated learning (Winne, 2010) and expands upon current directions in interdisciplinary education (Lattuca, Voigt and Fath, 2004) to describe pedagogical foundations that point toward interdisciplinary methods as a support for entrepreneurship education at the higher education level. In addition, the concepts discussed are linked to interdisciplinary practices at the Oulu University of Applied Sciences LAB pre-incubator programs as an example to demonstrate how this framework can be used to research educational outcomes in practice.;1860088398;;;Conference Papers & Proceedings;;"Stevenson, Blair;Nuottila, Erkki";;; Copyright Academic Conferences International Limited Sep 2016;;; Feature;;; Sep 2016;;2049-1050;; English; English;; 781-786; Reading;Sep 2016;European Conference on Innovation and Entrepreneurship;;2016;;;;https://search.proquest.com/docview/1860088398?accountid=11774;;;; References , Illustrations;;; 781;; Entrepreneurs , Colleges & universities , Innovations , Higher education , Students , Teaching , Startups , Hypotheses , Entrepreneurship education , Problems , Pedagogy , Peers , Interdisciplinary aspects , Problem based learning , Studies;;;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Apqrl&amp;atitle=Interdisciplinarity+in+Entrepreneurship+Education%3A+A+Conceptual+Framework+Focusing+on+Pedagogy+for+Innovation&amp;title=European+Conference+on+Innovation+and+Entrepreneurship&amp;issn=20491050&amp;date=2016-09-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=781&amp;au=Stevenson%2C+Blair%3BNuottila%2C+Erkki&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=European+Conference+on+Innovation+and+Entrepreneurship&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/";ProQuest Central
The Proposed Methods to Improve Teaching of Software Engineering;  The use of software is an essential part of our modern lives. Hence, this increases the importance of studying Software Engineering (SE) course. In general, the software engineering graduates usually lack the necessary skills, expertise, abilities, and sufficient knowledge when beginning their careers in the software industry. Due to that, a majority of students find it difficult to find relevant jobs. This paper proposes novel methods to teach SE course to improve the teaching and enhance knowledge and skills of students. It is proposed to include: identifying the course learning objectives (CLOs) and the required skills of the SE course, combining cooperative learning and mastery learning strategies to teaching software engineering, using social media to teach SE course, and establish the OSES in an educational institution. The goal of this paper is to improve the quality of SE teaching and facilitate students learning to prepare them for their future careers. Qualitative technique is used as a research design to evaluate the proposed solution. The results indicate that this proposal is supported by the majority of professionals working in the academia and industry.;1886771165;;;Scholarly Journals;;"Alabbadi, Afra A;Qureshi, Rizwan J";;; Copyright Modern Education and Computer Science Press Jul 2016;;; Feature;;; Jul 2016;;2075-0161;7; English; English;; n/a; Hong Kong;Jul 2016;International Journal of Modern Education and Computer Science;;2016;;;8;https://search.proquest.com/docview/1886771165?accountid=11774;;;; References;;; 13;; Software engineering , Computer science , Teaching; Software engineering , education , cooperative mastery , social media , industry experts , methods of teaching;;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aeducation&amp;atitle=The+Proposed+Methods+to+Improve+Teaching+of+Software+Engineering&amp;title=International+Journal+of+Modern+Education+and+Computer+Science&amp;issn=20750161&amp;date=2016-07-01&amp;volume=8&amp;issue=7&amp;spage=13&amp;au=Alabbadi%2C+Afra+A%3BQureshi%2C+Rizwan+J&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=International+Journal+of+Modern+Education+and+Computer+Science&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/";ProQuest Central,SciTech Premium Collection,Social Science Premium Collection
Empowering Students to Create Better Virtual Reality Applications: A Longitudinal Study of a VR Capstone Course;In this paper we present our experiences of teaching an annually organized virtual reality (VR) capstone course. We review three iterations of the course, during which a total of 45 students completed the course and 16 VR applications were implemented. Our comparative analysis describes the students' evaluation of the course, the applications created by them, and their development experiences. The results suggest that our gradual improvements on the course and the utilized software paid off, as the latest of the compared course iterations produced the best feedback and the highest quality VR applications. Our learning assessment analysis reveals that our course is effective in teaching VR application development and having students meet their personal learning goals. We also bring forward our RUIS toolkit that was used in the course with success, and present evidence on how better software toolkits can affect the development experience and allow students to create more impressive applications. Finally we share the lessons learned during five years of teaching the course, introducing several practical considerations for VR course organizers regarding pedagogics, software, and hardware.;1862786298;;;Scholarly Journals;;"Takala, Tuukka M;Malmi, Lauri;Pugliese, Roberto;Takala, Tapio";;; Copyright Institute of Mathematics and Informatics 2016;; 10.15388/infedu.2016.15; Journal Article;;; 2016;;1648-5831;2; English; English;; 287-317; Vilnius;2016;Informatics in Education;;2016;;;15;https://search.proquest.com/docview/1862786298?accountid=11774;;;;;;; 287;; Software , Students , Virtual reality , Education , Toolkits , Virtual reality , Students , Correlation analysis;;;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aeducation&amp;atitle=Empowering+Students+to+Create+Better+Virtual+Reality+Applications%3A+A+Longitudinal+Study+of+a+VR+Capstone+Course&amp;title=Informatics+in+Education&amp;issn=16485831&amp;date=2016-07-01&amp;volume=15&amp;issue=2&amp;spage=287&amp;au=Takala%2C+Tuukka+M%3BMalmi%2C+Lauri%3BPugliese%2C+Roberto%3BTakala%2C+Tapio&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=Informatics+in+Education&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/10.15388%2Finfedu.2016.15";ProQuest Central,SciTech Premium Collection,Social Science Premium Collection
Spiral and Project-Based Learning with Peer Assessment in a Computer Science Project Management Course;"Different learning methods such as project-based learning, spiral learning and peer assessment have been implemented in science disciplines with different outcomes. This paper presents a proposal for a project management course in the context of a computer science degree. Our proposal combines three well-known methods: project-based learning, spiral learning and peer assessment. Namely, the course is articulated during a semester through the structured (progressive and incremental) development of a sequence of four projects, whose duration, scope and difficulty of management increase as the student gains theoretical and instrumental knowledge related to planning, monitoring and controlling projects. Moreover, the proposal is complemented using peer assessment. The proposal has already been implemented and validated for the last 3&#xa0;years in two different universities. In the first year, project-based learning and spiral learning methods were combined. Such a combination was also employed in the other 2&#xa0;years; but additionally, students had the opportunity to assess projects developed by university partners and by students of the other university. A total of 154 students have participated in the study. We obtain a gain in the quality of the subsequently projects derived from the spiral project-based learning. Moreover, this gain is significantly bigger when peer assessment is introduced. In addition, high-performance students take advantage of peer assessment from the first moment, whereas the improvement in poor-performance students is delayed.";2259588319;;;Scholarly Journals; Dpto. de Matemáticas y Computación, Universidad de La Rioja, Logroño, Spain , Dpto. de Lenguajes y Sistemas Informáticos, Fac.

Hackathon for Learning Digital Theology in Computer Science;  Hackathon is an event where programmers and subject field specialists collaborate intensively in teams with the ultimate aim to create and design fresh ICT (information and communication technology) based solutions to a given task in a limited time. In this study, we analyzed students' perceptions and experience in a hackathon where they were to design a concept for an application aimed at people that are preparing for their own death. The hackathon was part of a Digital Theology (DT) course at the university for Computer Science (CS) students. A group of 12 students participated in the event. The participants were divided into three groups. The assignment was presented to all the groups to brainstorm and create a mock-up artefact suitable to tackle the challenge. In the end, each group presented their solution. Due to the limited number of students, we applied descriptive statistics rather than exploring into inferential statistics to analyze the data. By collecting data through questionnaires and interviewing the participants, we concluded that the use of hackathon helped to achieve the learning goals of learning DT. The students expressed their satisfaction in the fact that it provided them with motivation to learn through practice. Also, students agreed that the event helped them to think collaboratively for a refined ideas. The overwhelming satisfaction expressed by the students goes to confirm that hackathon brings out the best creative skills from people through problem-solving.;1886769272;;;Scholarly Journals;;"Kolog, Emmanuel Awuni;Sutinen, Erkki;Nygren, Eeva";;; Copyright Modern Education and Computer Science Press Jun 2016;;; Journal Article;;; Jun 2016;;2075-0161;6; English; English;; n/a; Hong Kong;Jun 2016;International Journal of Modern Education and Computer Science;;2016;;;8;https://search.proquest.com/docview/1886769272?accountid=11774;;;; References;;; 1;; Communications technology , Information technology , Computer science , Technology education; Hackathon , Digital Theology , Computer Science Education , Trans-disciplinary Education;;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aeducation&amp;atitle=Hackathon+for+Learning+Digital+Theology+in+Computer+Science&amp;title=International+Journal+of+Modern+Education+and+Computer+Science&amp;issn=20750161&amp;date=2016-06-01&amp;volume=8&amp;issue=6&amp;spage=1&amp;au=Kolog%2C+Emmanuel+Awuni%3BSutinen%2C+Erkki%3BNygren%2C+Eeva&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=International+Journal+of+Modern+Education+and+Computer+Science&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/";ProQuest Central,SciTech Premium Collection,Social Science Premium Collection
Real-World Software Projects as Tools for the Improvement of Student Motivation and University-Industry Collaboration;Software engineering education has to deal with different challenges nowadays in Hungary. While the number of job offers in this field is continuously increasing the students' interest in programming shows a declining trend. The recognition of the problem led to several initiatives trying to address the existing lack of software engineers and student motivation in programming. This paper reports some of our successful attempts to reverse the unfavorable process. While some short-scale solutions like the usage of Lego mobile robots or team-based laboratory class assignments provided only short term lasting improvements the break-through was achieved by the help of a strong University-Industry collaboration. Real-world software projects as team-work assignments brought benefits for the students as well as for the university and the involved companies. As a large-scale modification of the study program towards the enhancement of the industry readiness of our graduates the key features of the cooperative education are outlined at the end of the paper as well.;1825559233; PQ0003409125;;Scholarly Journals;;Johanyak, Zsolt Csaba;;;; Johanyak, Zsolt Csaba; 10.1109/ICIMSA.2016.7504028; Journal Article , Conference;;; May 2016;;;; English; English;; 1-4;;May 2016;The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, Inc.

Play Ball: Bringing Scrum into the Classroom;Scrum has become a widely-used framework for technology development in both private industry and the government. As a result, Information Systems recruiters and executives have recently been placing a focus on students with Scrum knowledge. Unfortunately, current System Analysis and Design textbooks provide cursory attention to Scrum. Thus, the purpose of this paper is to suggest a starting point for teaching Scrum at the university level by presenting a classroom exercise (Ball Game) that can be used as a means for learning Scrum in more detail. This tip accomplishes three things: (1) introduces students to Scrum concepts with an engaging and memorable exercise, (2) provides a means for teaching students about estimation, and (3) offers an approach that allows students to witness firsthand how self-organized teams inspect, adapt, and evolve.;1915750629;;;Scholarly Journals; Computer Information Systems & Business Analytics James Madison University Harrisonburg, VA 22807, USA mayjl@jmu.edu , FoxHedge Ltd 18899 Maplewood Lane Leesburg, VA 20175, USA Jim@FoxHedgeLtd.com , Computer Information Systems & Business Analytics James Madison University Harrisonburg, VA 22807, USA lendindc@jmu.edu;"May, Jeffrey;York, Jim;Lending, Diane";;" Capital One Financial Corp

Students teach students: Alternative teaching in Greek secondary education;  The students of a Greek junior high school collaborated to prepare the teaching material of a theoretical Computer Science (CS) course and then shared their understanding with other students. This study investigates two alternative teaching methods (collaborative learning and peer tutoring) and compares the learning results to the traditional learning context. A test was used to measure all participating students' learning results and a questionnaire was distributed to record participant student attitudes towards the alternative teaching conditions. The questionnaire was designed to evaluate each aspect in terms of perceived knowledge, experience, satisfaction, diversity, oddness and interest. The analysis explores potential differences of students' learning results between alternative and traditional teaching and also differences in the two aspects in relation to students' preferences. Results provide evidence that active-learning methods can promote positive attitudinal shifts and improve skills in creativity, teamwork, collaboration and communication. Students perceived higher levels of learning than with traditional teaching. Finally in terms of students' preferences, the majority wanted to have more courses taught with active-learning methods.;1771232493;;;Scholarly Journals;;"Theodoropoulos, Anastasios;Antoniou, Angeliki;Lepouras, George";;; Springer Science+Business Media New York 2016;; 10.1007/s10639-014-9327-7; Feature;;; Mar 2016;;1360-2357;2; English; English;; 373-399; New York;Mar 2016;Education and Information Technologies;;2016;;;21;https://search.proquest.com/docview/1771232493?accountid=11774;;;; References;;; 373;; Peer tutoring , Collaborative learning , Secondary school students , Educational technology , Technology education; Secondary education , Collaborative learning , Peer tutoring , Student collaboration , Peer assessment , Information and communication technologies;;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aeducation&amp;atitle=Students+teach+students%3A+Alternative+teaching+in+Greek+secondary+education&amp;title=Education+and+Information+Technologies&amp;issn=13602357&amp;date=2016-03-01&amp;volume=21&amp;issue=2&amp;spage=373&amp;au=Theodoropoulos%2C+Anastasios%3BAntoniou%2C+Angeliki%3BLepouras%2C+George&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=Education+and+Information+Technologies&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/10.1007%2Fs10639-014-9327-7";ProQuest Central,Social Science Premium Collection
Experience Teaching Introductory Programming Courses;This paper describes the teaching methods and teaching experiences of an instructor who has been teaching computer science freshmen for more than ten years. Problem-based learning has been used in introductory programming courses to enhance the quality of learning. The common problem in introductory programming courses is that instructors quite often focus mainly on programming language syntax and usage but ignore the real world applications of these language features. Accordingly, students are likely to find out that it is difficult to apply their programming skills on solving complex problems in their high level courses. Through introducing problem-based learning in introductory programming courses, students not only could obtain experience of dealing with complex problems, but also could practice other soft skills, such as team working skills, which could better prepare them for junior and senior level coursework and capstone projects. In addition, other philosophy issues related to teaching introductory courses are discussed and tentative solutions are presented.;1884102969; PQ0004111535;;Scholarly Journals;;Yu, Liguo;;;; Yu, Liguo; 10.4018/IJQAETE.2016010104; Journal Article;;; January 1, 2016;;2155-496X;1; English; English;; 40-53;;January 1, 2016;International Journal of Quality Assurance in Engineering and Technology Education; CSAPTjournals;2016; IGI Global, 701 E.

The association between tolerance for ambiguity and fear of negative evaluation: A study of engineering technology capstone courses;For many students in engineering and engineering technology programs in the US, senior capstone design courses require students to form a team, define a problem, and find a feasible technical solution to address this problem. Students must integrate the knowledge and skills acquired during their studies at the college or university level. These truly integrative design activities do not have a single “correct” solution. Instead, there is an array of solutions, many of which could be used to achieve the final result. This ambiguity can cause students to experience anxiety during the projects. This study examined the main topics: • To what extent is a social anxiety (measured as fear of negative evaluation) related to tolerance for ambiguity in senior engineering capstone courses? • How does exposure to ambiguity prior to and during capstone courses affect tolerance for ambiguity? The study looked at the standard educational practices to see if they have unintended consequences, such a social anxiety in dealing with ambiguity. Those consequences are highly undesirable because they reduce students’ learning. It was hypothesized that the lecture-based approaches that are more common in the first three years of study would not prepare students for self-directed capstone courses because the students would rarely have experienced problem-based learning before. The study used a quantitative approach and examined students’ perceptions of their tolerance for ambiguity, and social anxiety before and after their senior capstone design experience. A survey instrument was adapted to measure exposure to ambiguity, which was studied as a potential moderator of the relationship between social anxiety and tolerance for ambiguity. The study indicated that social anxiety, as measured by fear of negative evaluation, does not play a major role in capstone courses. The second finding is that a single course, even if it was administered as a problem-based senior class, failed to increase students’ tolerance for ambiguity. Students with low tolerance have more problems with ambiguity, whereas students with high tolerance can more easily endure changes and find it easier to act in the absence of complete information. The third important finding was that exposure to ambiguity prior to capstone courses does affect tolerance for ambiguity while controlling for instructor and if exposure to ambiguity is included as a moderator. It was not in the scope of this study to explore the effect of instructor more deeply, but this provides a direction for future research, especially in this time of expanding implementation of project- and problem-based learning methods in technical curricula.;1881528147;;;Dissertations & Theses;;Dubikovsky, Sergey I.;;;" Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.";;; Dissertation/Thesis;;; 2016; 978-1-369-64146-2;;; English; English;;;;2016;ProQuest Dissertations and Theses;;2016;;;;https://search.proquest.com/docview/1881528147?accountid=11774;; 0525 Educational psychology , 0537 Engineering , 0714 Science education; 0525 Educational psychology , 0537 Engineering , 0714 Science education;; 0525 Educational psychology , 0537 Engineering , 0714 Science education;;; 0525 Educational psychology , 0537 Engineering , 0714 Science education; Educational psychology , Engineering , Science education; Applied sciences , Education , Exposure to ambiguity , Problem-based learning , Project-based learning , Senior engineering capstone courses , Social anxiety , Tolerance for ambiguity;;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:Matericals+Science+%26+Engineering+Dissertations&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+association+between+tolerance+for+ambiguity+and+fear+of+negative+evaluation%3A+A+study+of+engineering+technology+capstone+courses&amp;issn=&amp;date=2016-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Dubikovsky%2C+Sergey+I.&amp;isbn=978-1-369-64146-2&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/";SciTech Premium Collection

Communication patterns and strategies in software development communities of practice;Some of the greatest challenges in the relatively new field of software development lie in the decidedly old technology of communication between humans. Software projects require sophisticated and varied communication skills because software developers work in a world of incomplete, imperfect information where teams evolve rapidly in response to evolving requirements and changing collaborators. While prescriptive models for software process such as Agile suggest ways of doing, in reality these codified practices must adapt to the complexities of a real workplace. Patterns, rather than rules of behavior within software process are more suitable to the varied and mutable nature of software development. Software development communities are also learning communities, attempting to sustain themselves through internal ambiguity and external changes. We study different types of software development communities to fulfill our goal of understanding how these communities implement and evolve different communication strategies to sustain themselves through change. We observe student software development projects, open source software development, and a professional, rigorously Agile software development community. We employ Wenger's concept of Community of Practice to frame our understanding, especially focusing on the notions of identity, participation, reification, negotiation of meaning and trajectory of the participants of the software development communities. From these different sources, we identify the emergent themes of mentoring and knowledge management as critical for sustainable communities. Through our long running, immersive, participant observer, ethnographic study of the Agile software development community, we contribute both a quantitative and qualitative analysis of the their communication practices and depict the evolving nature of their onboarding and mentoring strategies. We share our experience of implementing such an immersive industry ethnographic study. We employ a pattern language approach to capturing, analyzing and representing our results, thereby contributing and relating to the larger bodies of work in Scrum and Organizational Patterns. This work also informs our concurrent efforts to enhance our undergraduate computer science and software engineering curriculum, exposing students to the communication challenges of real software development and help them to develop skills to meet these challenges through practice in inquiry, critique and reflection.;1847984196;;;Dissertations & Theses;;Kumar, Shreya;;;" Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.";;; Dissertation/Thesis;;; 2016; 978-1-369-22686-7;;; English; English;;;;2016;ProQuest Dissertations and Theses;;2016;;;;https://search.proquest.com/docview/1847984196?accountid=11774;; 0515 Education , 0984 Computer science; 0515 Education , 0984 Computer science;; 0515 Education , 0984 Computer science;;; 0515 Education , 0984 Computer science; Education , Computer science; Applied sciences , Education , Communication patterns , Communities of practice , Organizational patterns , Pogil , Software development practice , Software engineering curriculum;;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:Education+Database&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Communication+patterns+and+strategies+in+software+development+communities+of+practice&amp;issn=&amp;date=2016-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Kumar%2C+Shreya&amp;isbn=978-1-369-22686-7&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/";ProQuest Central,SciTech Premium Collection,Social Science Premium Collection
An analysis of stakeholders communication in collaborative software development projects;Software development is a multidisciplinary collaboration involving many stakeholders. However, existing software development processes exhibit many issues related to that collaboration. Because prior research on stakeholder analysis and teamwork revealed the importance of communication, this study analyzed stakeholder communication with reference to team activities as a social and cognitive process. The study’s goal was to understand the collaboration process during software development and to delineate factors that influence this process. We focused on communication between the software developers and their clients during the requirements gathering phase, the team process, and the inter-team and interdisciplinary collaboration, in particular between software engineers and technical communicators. First, we conducted observations to help uncover the causes of variances in collaboration performance. Then we modified aspects of the collaboration process and compared team performance. We also performed an experimental study to further test the supporting effect of clients’ documents on requirement gathering. Finally, teams’ working structures and their impact on team performance were investigated using social network analysis. Among our findings was that clients are critical to the success of software development. Providing teams with documents that support requirement gathering facilitates team efficiency, but there is a trade-off in that team members may generate fewer creative ideas. Another finding was that software teams should ensure that members from all disciplines actively participate in projects. Finally, although teams need leadership, effective leadership is not a strong team member performing all coordination and tasks. A moderately centralized team structure is preferred.;1847984084;;;Dissertations & Theses;;Zhang, Wei;;;" Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.";;; Dissertation/Thesis;;; 2016; 978-1-369-22761-1;;; English; English;;;;2016;ProQuest Dissertations and Theses;;2016;;;;https://search.proquest.com/docview/1847984084?accountid=11774;; 0633 Cognitive psychology; 0633 Cognitive psychology;; 0633 Cognitive psychology;;; 0633 Cognitive psychology; Cognitive psychology; Psychology , Communication , Social network analysis , Software development , Teamwork;;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:Psychology+Database&amp;atitle=&amp;title=An+analysis+of+stakeholders+communication+in+collaborative+software+development+projects&amp;issn=&amp;date=2016-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Zhang%2C+Wei&amp;isbn=978-1-369-22761-1&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/";ProQuest Central
Defining the competencies, programming languages, and assessments for an introductory computer science course;The purpose of this study was to define the competencies, programming languages, and assessments for an introductory computer science course at a small private liberal arts university. Three research questions were addressed that involved identifying the competencies, programming languages, and assessments that academic and industry experts in California’s Central Valley felt most important and appropriate for an introduction to computer science course. The Delphi methodology was used to collect data from the two groups of experts with various backgrounds related to computing. The goal was to find consensus among the individual groups to best define aspects that would best comprise an introductory CS0 course for majors and non-majors. The output would be valuable information to be considered by curriculum designers who are developing a new program in software engineering at the institution. The process outlined would also be useful to curriculum designers in other fields and geographic regions who attempt to address their local education needs. Four rounds of surveys were conducted. The groups of experts were combined in the first round to rate the items in the straw models determined from the literature and add additional components when necessary. The academic and industry groupings were separated for the remainder of the study so that a curriculum designer could determine not only the items deemed most important, but also their relative importance among the two distinct groups. The experts selected items in each of the three categories in the second round to reduce the possibilities for subsequent rounds. The groups were then asked to rank the items in each of the three categories for the third round. A fourth round was held as consensus was not reached by either of the groups for any of the categories as determined by Kendall’s W . The academic experts reached consensus on a list of ranked competencies in the final round and showed a high degree of agreement on lists of ranked programming languages and assessments. Kendall’s W , values, however, were just short of the required 0.7 threshold for consensus on these final two items. The industry experts did not reach consensus and showed low agreement on their recommendations for competencies, programming languages, and assessments.;1845311230;;;Dissertations & Theses;;Sultana, Simon;;;" Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.";;; Dissertation/Thesis;;; 2016; 978-1-369-21907-4;;; English; English;;;;2016;ProQuest Dissertations and Theses;;2016;;;;https://search.proquest.com/docview/1845311230?accountid=11774;; 0447 Instructional Design , 0727 Curriculum development , 0984 Computer science; 0447 Instructional Design , 0727 Curriculum development , 0984 Computer science;; 0447 Instructional Design , 0727 Curriculum development , 0984 Computer science;;; 0447 Instructional Design , 0727 Curriculum development , 0984 Computer science; Instructional Design , Curriculum development , Computer science; Applied sciences , Education , Assessments , Competencies , Curriculum development , Delphi , Introductory computer science , Programming languages;;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:Education+Database&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Defining+the+competencies%2C+programming+languages%2C+and+assessments+for+an+introductory+computer+science+course&amp;issn=&amp;date=2016-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Sultana%2C+Simon&amp;isbn=978-1-369-21907-4&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/";ProQuest Central,SciTech Premium Collection,Social Science Premium Collection
Computer-Supported Agile Teaching;Agile methodologies have revolutionized the software development process through continuous assessment and adaptation of the development effort, collaboration with customers, and incremental delivery of features towards a complete product. In this dissertation we are proposing an analogous methodology for pedagogy called Computer-Supported Agile Teaching (CSAT). The CSAT framework is founded on the principles of agile teaching, active learning, and a reliance on technology in achieving pedagogy design that is efficient with decision-making that is evidence-based. In CSAT, the discovery of effective learning and teaching methods is similar to agile-based development, where students, teaching assistants (TAs) and instructors work as a cross-functional and self-organizing team. Just as in agile, the team works in transparency (collaboration among students and the teaching staff around explicit teaching and learning objectives), inspection (of the learning and teaching processes and their effectiveness towards achieving optimal curriculum results), and in adaptation of the pedagogy (teaching and learning methods and resources) in response to the observed needs and potentials of the learners. Constant use of learning analytics, formative assessments and feedback activities are used as learning opportunities and ways to evaluate learning and teaching processes. Throughout this design, we take advantage of the affordances and capabilities of modern information technology in achieving better efficiency and effectiveness of the supported learning and teaching activities. In the four years of this doctoral work, we designed and developed the TeachBack web-based application to support the CSAT methodology. This process involved continuous engagement with teachers and students inside and outside of the classroom as we refined our pedagogy ideas and the corresponding TeachBack features. Through the use of TeachBack and various experimental studies we evaluated the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed CSAT methodology. We discovered that pedagogy-based use of computers in the classroom can effectively support learning and teaching. Moreover, data generated in computer-mediated classrooms can be used to more accurately discover learning characteristics of the individual students, to better evaluate the effectiveness of learning and teaching methods, to rapidly detect students at-risk, and to adapt the pedagogy to the needs and potentials of the learners using an evidence-based approach. These are the processes that define the implementation of CSAT in the classroom. Based on these results, we believe that the proposed CSAT methodology is both feasible and pedagogically effective, and has the potential to positively transform college teaching and learning.;1837433116;;;Dissertations & Theses;;Tarimo, William T.;;;" Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.";;; Dissertation/Thesis;;; 2016; 978-1-369-12914-4;;; English; English;;;;2016;ProQuest Dissertations and Theses;;2016;;;;https://search.proquest.com/docview/1837433116?accountid=11774;; 0456 Pedagogy , 0515 Education , 0710 Educational technology; 0456 Pedagogy , 0515 Education , 0710 Educational technology;; 0456 Pedagogy , 0515 Education , 0710 Educational technology;;; 0456 Pedagogy , 0515 Education , 0710 Educational technology; Pedagogy , Education , Educational technology; Education , Agile teaching and learning , Computer-supported pedagogy , Flipped classroom , Pedagogy design , Teaching and learning analytics;;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:Education+Database&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Computer-Supported+Agile+Teaching&amp;issn=&amp;date=2016-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Tarimo%2C+William+T.&amp;isbn=978-1-369-12914-4&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/";ProQuest Central,Social Science Premium Collection
Embracing security in all phases of the software development life cycle: A Delphi study;Software is omnipresent from refrigerators to financial institutions. In addition to software that defines cyber system functionality, there is an increasing amount of digitized data on cyber systems. This increasing amount of easily available data has prompted a rise in attacks on cyber systems by globally organized attackers. The solution (which has been proposed by multiple authors) is to plan security into software products throughout all software development phases. This approach constitutes a change in the software development life cycle (SDLC) process. Acceptance and approval from all software development stakeholders is needed to make this type of cultural paradigm shift. A Delphi study into what would encourage software development stakeholders to accept the need for security during software development was performed. Results of the three-round Delphi study revealed education (formal and informal) would increase software development stakeholder understanding of the risks of insecure software and educate stakeholders on how to plan and write more secure software. The Delphi study also revealed that mitigation of time and resource constraints on software projects is needed to encourage software teams to embrace the need and efforts necessary to include security in all phases of the SDLC.;1837356113;;;Dissertations & Theses;;Deschene, Marie;;;" Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.";;; Dissertation/Thesis;;; 2016; 978-1-369-11709-7;;; English; English;;;;2016;ProQuest Dissertations and Theses;;2016;;;;https://search.proquest.com/docview/1837356113?accountid=11774;; 0464 Computer Engineering , 0984 Computer science; 0464 Computer Engineering , 0984 Computer science;; 0464 Computer Engineering , 0984 Computer science;;; 0464 Computer Engineering , 0984 Computer science; Computer Engineering , Computer science; Applied sciences , Cyber breaches , Cyber security , SDLC , Software breaches , Software development lifecycle , Software security;;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:Matericals+Science+%26+Engineering+Dissertations&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Embracing+security+in+all+phases+of+the+software+development+life+cycle%3A+A+Delphi+study&amp;issn=&amp;date=2016-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Deschene%2C+Marie&amp;isbn=978-1-369-11709-7&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/";ProQuest Central,SciTech Premium Collection
Developing an innovative educational environment using Web 2.0;"Collaborative work has become an essential part of education, especially in higher education. Educational institutions are making increasing use of web-based technologies to support communication and collaboration among students. In this thesis, I address the problems of complexity and inflexibility in collaborative tools provided by educational institutions, such as Course Management System (Blackboard) and the different collaborative features it provides. There have been research studies that indicated the unsatisfactory adoption rate of collaborative features in CMS by students and teachers due to the complication and inflexibility of these tools (Guidry and BrckaLorenz, 2010; Papastergiou, 2006; Rosato et al., 2007). An examination of the key features and success factors in existing collaborative tools can provide insight into the design of a collaborative tool that better addresses students’ needs. First, I conducted a survey study with students in an urban university in Midwestern U.S, through which I identified the key features and success factors in collaborative tools from students’ perspectives. Second, through the integration of Web 2.0 technologies, I designed and developed U-Connect, a dynamic and interactive collaborative tool that allows students to easily and quickly create or join groups and share their ideas, thoughts and resources with each other while working in groups. Third, I conducted a pilot study to evaluate U-Connect and proposed a set of additional features and design recommendations for collaborative tools to better support academic group work.";1830448677;;;Dissertations & Theses;;Mohamed, HousamEldin Adel-Ragab;;;" Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.";;; Dissertation/Thesis;;; 2016; 978-1-369-01648-2;;; English; English;;;;2016;ProQuest Dissertations and Theses;;2016;;;;https://search.proquest.com/docview/1830448677?accountid=11774;; 0489 Information Technology , 0710 Educational technology , 0984 Computer science; 0489 Information Technology , 0710 Educational technology , 0984 Computer science;; 0489 Information Technology , 0710 Educational technology , 0984 Computer science;;; 0489 Information Technology , 0710 Educational technology , 0984 Computer science; Information Technology , Educational technology , Computer science; Applied sciences , Education , Collaborative learning , Collaborative tools , Human-computer interaction , Knowledge sharing , User experience , Web 2.0 technologies;;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:Education+Database&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Developing+an+innovative+educational+environment+using+Web+2.0&amp;issn=&amp;date=2016-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Mohamed%2C+HousamEldin+Adel-Ragab&amp;isbn=978-1-369-01648-2&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/";ProQuest Central,SciTech Premium Collection,Social Science Premium Collection
What Makes a Great Software Engineer;Good software engineers are essential to the creation of good software. However, today, we lack a holistic, contextual, and real-world understanding of software engineering expertise. In this dissertation, we address this gap by investigating the thesis: “Experts involved in the creation of software view software engineering expertise as holistically encompassing internal personality attributes, attributes regarding engagement with others, in addition to technical capabilities in designing and writing code. Furthermore, the ability to make good decisions (e.g. choosing what software to write and how to write), which has not yet been articulated by previous research studies, is also critically important. The key aspects of being a great software engineer are: writing good code, adjusting behaviors to account for future values and costs, practicing informed decision-making, avoiding making others’ jobs harder, and learning continuously.” We interview 59 expert Microsoft software engineers to inductively understand what software engineering expertise entailed. We survey 1,926 more expert Microsoft software engineers to understand the relative importance of the 45 attributes of expertise derived from interviews, as well as to understand the influence of context on ratings. Finally, we interview 46 expert non-software-engineers who have collaborated with software engineers to understand their perspectives. We collectively consider all our data to answer the question: what makes a great software engineer?;1830448263;;;Dissertations & Theses;;Li, Paul Luo;;;" Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.";;; Dissertation/Thesis;;; 2016; 978-1-369-17000-9;;; English; English;;;;2016;ProQuest Dissertations and Theses;;2016;;;;https://search.proquest.com/docview/1830448263?accountid=11774;; 0723 Information science , 0984 Computer science; 0723 Information science , 0984 Computer science;; 0723 Information science , 0984 Computer science;;; 0723 Information science , 0984 Computer science; Information science , Computer science; Communication and the arts , Applied sciences , Expertise , Software engineer , Software engineering , Teamwork;;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:Matericals+Science+%26+Engineering+Dissertations&amp;atitle=&amp;title=What+Makes+a+Great+Software+Engineer&amp;issn=&amp;date=2016-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Li%2C+Paul+Luo&amp;isbn=978-1-369-17000-9&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/";SciTech Premium Collection
Shaping Software Engineering Curricula Using Open Source Communities: A Case Study;This paper documents four years of a novel approach to teaching a two-course sequence in software engineering as part of the ABET-accredited computer science curriculum at the College of Charleston. This approach is team-based and centers on learning software engineering in the context of open source software projects. In the first course, teams develop automated testing frameworks for their chosen Free Open Source Software (FOSS) project, and in the second course, team members join and contribute to a selected open source project, documenting the process through regular blog and wiki posts and an oral presentation. Results point to the transformative nature of such coursework on students' perception of software engineering. Discussion focuses on potential future iterations of this capstone model.;1826517711; EJ1088490;;Scholarly Journals;;"Bowring, James;Burke, Quinn";;;;;; Article , Report , 080: Journal Articles , 143: Reports - Research;;; Jan 2016;;1093-023X;1; English; English;; 5-26;;Jan 2016;Journal of Interactive Learning Research; Scholarly Journals , Reports;2016; http://www.aace.org; ERIC, © Association for the Advancement of Computing in Education;27;https://search.proquest.com/docview/1826517711?accountid=11774;;;;;;; 5;;  10664ER5 3241ER5 6603ER5  10621 3227 6582 ,  2070ER5  2059 ,  2065ER5 5172ER5 8290ER5 3164ER5  2054 5155 8260 3150 ,  7379ER5 10713ER5  7353 10669 ,  11140ER5 4761ER5 8075ER5 3164ER5  11096 4744 8046 3150 ,  6276ER5 10321ER5 8043ER5 4558ER5  6256 10278 8016 4542 ,  10685ER5 4527ER5 912ER5  10642 4511 909 ,  3707ER5 5901ER5  3692 5882 ,  2236ER5 5901ER5  2225 5882 ,  3358ER5 2054ER5 1860ER5 10724ER5 1873ER5 10713ER5 8281ER5 6603ER5  3344 8251 6582 2043 10680 1862 10669 1849 ,  2838ER5 6132ER5 7130ER5 8402ER5 6139ER5 4935ER5 5983ER5  2826 6113 7104 8371 6120 4918 5964 ,  10303ER5 10423ER5 3643ER5 6603ER5  10260 10380 3629 6582 ,  10525ER5 732ER5  10482 730 ,  10219ER5 732ER5  10181 730 ,  1815ER5 10321ER5 8043ER5 4558ER5  1806 10278 8016 4542 ,  10282ER5 9179ER5 126ER5  10240 9146 126 , South Carolina; Higher Education , Postsecondary Education , South Carolina;;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aeric&amp;atitle=Shaping+Software+Engineering+Curricula+Using+Open+Source+Communities%3A+A+Case+Study&amp;title=Journal+of+Interactive+Learning+Research&amp;issn=1093023X&amp;date=2016-01-01&amp;volume=27&amp;issue=1&amp;spage=5&amp;au=Bowring%2C+James%3BBurke%2C+Quinn&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=Journal+of+Interactive+Learning+Research&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/EJ1088490&amp;rft_id=info:doi/";Social Science Premium Collection
A comparative study of agile methods, people factors, and process factors in relation to project success;Agile development methodology has had a higher success rate than any other software methodology. Despite agile methodology’s success, agile projects face challenges. Many projects may deliver on time, but might not have all the expected features. Projects may come in at the expected cost, but not on time. Other projects may have all the expected features, but be over cost or late. Many researchers have evaluated the critical success factors of agile projects, different agile methods, and success criteria in terms of cost, quality, scope and time for software development projects. However, no researchers have compared critical success factors among the different agile methods. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of two elements, people and process, on the perceived success of software development projects when using different agile development methods. Chow and Cao have determined the critical success factors for agile projects. This study is an extension to their exploratory study with a deeper focus on the contributions of the different agile methods to the success of agile projects. The researcher created sixteen hypotheses from the key factors Chow and Cao identified: customer involvement, team capability, project management, and project definition of perceived project success in terms of cost, quality, scope, and time while looking at the different contributions of various agile methods to agile projects. The study was quantitative and nonexperimental. It used 174 randomly selected SurveyMonkey audience service participants, all over the age of 21. The researcher analyzed the data using Spearman Rank Correlation and Krustal-Wallis H test. The analysis showed that the people and process critical success factors contributed to agile project success in terms of cost, quality, scope, and time, but choice of which agile method used made no difference to project success rate. This result is useful to practitioners and researchers. The study suggests that proper management of people and process factors are key to the success of agile projects no matter the agile methods used.;1823291748;;;Dissertations & Theses;;Litchmore, Kondo A.

The influence of peer evaluations on individual contributions to group work in online graduate education;As online learning has become increasingly interactive and collaborative, group work and other collaborative learning exercises have become more prevalent in online curricula. Unequal levels of effort in online group work causes frustration and can reduce overall learning among students. Students who are perceived by group members to contribute less than their fair share to online group work are considered free-riders. Peer evaluations have been shown to increase individual contributions to group work in face-to-face, undergraduate environments. There is a need to examine the influence of peer evaluations on contributions to group work in online, graduate-level environments. The purpose of this study was to compare individual student contributions to group work between three different groups of students using different peer evaluation approaches in online, graduate-level coursework in the US Army Command and General Staff Officers Course (CGSOC). This quantitative causal comparative study examined 230 CGSOC students who engaged in a complex, collaborative planning group project in the first module of the course between January and July of 2015. Controlling for the variables of project position, grade, and Army component, a four-way ANOVA was used to analyze study data. While there were no significant differences found in individual contributions to group work between the groups, there were significant interaction effects between peer evaluation approach and Army component, as well as between peer evaluation approach and grade. These interaction effects indicated that, in certain situations, the level of contributions of students using different peer evaluation approaches tended to cluster or spread depending on their component or grade. Pre-announced peer evaluations generally resulted in similar levels of contributions of students amongst different components and grades of officers. The complex nature of the interaction effects suggests that additional research is required to fully understand the influence of peer evaluations in online adult education. As a result of this research, instructors and curriculum developers may have more insight into the utility and applicability of peer evaluations in different facets of graduate-level online education.;1821392003;;;Dissertations & Theses;;Pierson, David S.;;;" Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.";;; Dissertation/Thesis;;; 2016; 978-1-339-95763-0;;; English; English;;;;2016;ProQuest Dissertations and Theses;;2016;;;;https://search.proquest.com/docview/1821392003?accountid=11774;; 0447 Instructional Design , 0516 Adult education , 0727 Curriculum development; 0447 Instructional Design , 0516 Adult education , 0727 Curriculum development;; 0447 Instructional Design , 0516 Adult education , 0727 Curriculum development;;; 0447 Instructional Design , 0516 Adult education , 0727 Curriculum development; Instructional Design , Adult education , Curriculum development; Education , Adult learning , Free riding , Online learning , Peer assessment , Peer evaluation , Social loafing;;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:Education+Database&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+influence+of+peer+evaluations+on+individual+contributions+to+group+work+in+online+graduate+education&amp;issn=&amp;date=2016-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Pierson%2C+David+S.&amp;isbn=978-1-339-95763-0&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/";ProQuest Central,Social Science Premium Collection
Benefits and challenges of introducing a blended project-based approach in higher education: Experiences from a Kenyan university;  This article investigates a blended project-based approach that was introduced to forestry and ICT undergraduates as an extracurricular activity at the University of Eldoret, Kenya. The approach blends problem-based learning and participatory design to solve real-life forestry problems. Even though the use of the approach itself is not novel, in this article, we explore its introduction as an extracurricular activity at a university that currently follows a more traditional teaching paradigm. Using a multiple case study, the study explores the project implementation activities and student experiences in order to identify the benefits gained and challenges faced. The findings show that the used blended project-based approach results in solutions that are more contextually relevant and also equips the participating students with technical, interdisciplinary and interpersonal skills that are essential to entering the workplace which they may otherwise have not acquired from their curricula.;1821083695;;;Scholarly Journals;;"Munezero, Myriam D;Bekuta, Balozi K";;; Copyright University of the West Indies 2016;;; Feature;;; 2016;;;2; English; English;; 206-218; Bridgetown;2016;International Journal of Education and Development using Information and Communication Technology;;2016;;;12;https://search.proquest.com/docview/1821083695?accountid=11774;;;; Photographs , References;;; 206;; Extracurricular activities , Problems , Higher education , Students , Research , Teaching , Core curriculum , Internet access , Studies , Community , Pedagogy , Problem based learning , Kenya;;;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aeducation&amp;atitle=Benefits+and+challenges+of+introducing+a+blended+project-based+approach+in+higher+education%3A+Experiences+from+a+Kenyan+university&amp;title=International+Journal+of+Education+and+Development+using+Information+and+Communication+Technology&amp;issn=&amp;date=2016-01-01&amp;volume=12&amp;issue=2&amp;spage=206&amp;au=Munezero%2C+Myriam+D%3BBekuta%2C+Balozi+K&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=International+Journal+of+Education+and+Development+using+Information+and+Communication+Technology&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/";ProQuest Central,Social Science Premium Collection
Designing a better experience: A qualitative investigation of student engineering internships;Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) education play a very important role in preparing students with skills necessary to obtain better jobs, solve realworld challenges, and compete in the global economy. STEM education develops critical thinking and the ability to solve complex problems. Research showed that 8 out of 10 most desired employees were the ones with STEM education like electrical engineering or computer science, yet the United States has fallen in STEM ranking among advanced nations. Additionally, local firms are finding it difficult to recruit the STEM professionals they need be successful in business, and while STEM education is in great demand, lack of desired skills continues to challenge the industry and the new engineering graduates. A review of the literature identified gaps in skills such as technical skills, software skills, soft skills, and organizational culture and attributed these gaps partially to lack of collaboration between the industry and academia. Literature suggested changes to the engineering curriculum to narrow this gap between what students study and what is expected of them when they start a new career. In this qualitative research, the author used a phenomenological approached to answer the research questions. The author interviewed industry experts and inquired about the engineering internship best practices. The research results revealed critical skills which are grouped under four categories or main themes. Industry leaders can develop effective engineering internships based on these themes to prepare the next generation of young women and men to start a new career in engineering, reduce on the job training time, and increase innovation and productivity.;1809114616;;;Dissertations & Theses;;Paknejad, Mohammad R.;;;" Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.";;; Dissertation/Thesis;;; 2016; 978-1-339-83191-6;;; English; English;;;;2016;ProQuest Dissertations and Theses;;2016;;;;https://search.proquest.com/docview/1809114616?accountid=11774;; 0714 Science education , 0745 Higher education; 0714 Science education , 0745 Higher education;; 0714 Science education , 0745 Higher education;;; 0714 Science education , 0745 Higher education; Science education , Higher education; Education , Engineering internships , STEM , STEM education , Technology;;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:Education+Database&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Designing+a+better+experience%3A+A+qualitative+investigation+of+student+engineering+internships&amp;issn=&amp;date=2016-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Paknejad%2C+Mohammad+R.&amp;isbn=978-1-339-83191-6&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/";ProQuest Central,Social Science Premium Collection
A Quantitative Study of Global Software Development Teams, Requirements, and Software Projects;"The study explored the relationship between global software development teams, effective software requirements, and stakeholders' perception of successful software development projects within the field of information technology management. It examined the critical relationship between Global Software Development (GSD) teams creating effective software requirements and project success. The study addressed the unique problems inherent to GSD teams that create software requirements. To study the relationships, a Pearson correlation tested two null hypotheses with a set confidence level of 0.995 and a significant of p = 0.005. The Pearson correlation tests indicated the relationship between the variables, stakeholders' perception of successful software project (DV), global software development team (IV) and effective software requirements (IV) were not statistically significant different at p &gt; 0.005. Therefore, the null hypotheses could not be rejected and the alternative hypotheses could not be accepted. It would be advantageous to have further study done broadening the target sample to include a more globally diverse group of IT professionals. Although the findings were not as significant as was hypothesized they would be, this information was still beneficial since it allowed information technology organizations to broaden their understanding of the relationship between global software development teams, software requirements and successful software projects requirements.";1807424992;;;Dissertations & Theses;;Parker, Linda L.;;;" Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.";;; Dissertation/Thesis;;; 2016; 978-1-339-82880-0;;; English; English;;;;2016;ProQuest Dissertations and Theses;;2016;;;;https://search.proquest.com/docview/1807424992?accountid=11774;; 0310 Business administration , 0454 Management , 0489 Information Technology; 0310 Business administration , 0454 Management , 0489 Information Technology;; 0310 Business administration , 0454 Management , 0489 Information Technology;;; 0310 Business administration , 0454 Management , 0489 Information Technology; Business administration , Management , Information Technology; Social sciences , Applied sciences , Global software development teams , Software projects , Software requirements , Stakeholders;;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ABI%2FINFORM+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=A+Quantitative+Study+of+Global+Software+Development+Teams%2C+Requirements%2C+and+Software+Projects&amp;issn=&amp;date=2016-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Parker%2C+Linda+L.&amp;isbn=978-1-339-82880-0&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/";ProQuest Central
A Meeting-Oriented Process for Streamlining Business Collaboration: A Conceptual Example of Software Development Case;  Human beings play a critical role in any collaborative business activities, including software development. People and people-derived issues such as communication and teamwork efficiency and effectiveness are critical to their success. However, managing teamwork and stakeholder' involvement is a challenging work, especially when we often see that a technical job may be easily done, it requires substantial efforts for relevant stakeholders on brainstorming with people, reviewing the work, explaining and convincing the work to clients/reviewers, etc. To help resolve this human-side collaboration and communication issue, this paper focuses on software development project as an example and draws an attention on project meetings, and illustrates a meetings-flow approach. In this preliminary study, we would show you the innovative definition on meetings in order to help model and streamline the collaborative proceeding of software development.;1806998675;;;Conference Papers & Proceedings;;"Chen, Chung-Yang;Wu, Kuo-Wei;Lee, Jung-Chieh";;; Copyright The Steering Committee of The World Congress in Computer Science, Computer Engineering and Applied Computing (WorldComp) 2016;;; Feature;;; 2016;;;; English; English;; 224-229; Athens;2016;Proceedings of the International Conference on Software Engineering Research and Practice (SERP);;2016;;;;https://search.proquest.com/docview/1806998675?accountid=11774;;;; Diagrams , References;;; 224;;;;;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Ahightechjournals&amp;atitle=A+Meeting-Oriented+Process+for+Streamlining+Business+Collaboration%3A+A+Conceptual+Example+of+Software+Development+Case&amp;title=Proceedings+of+the+International+Conference+on+Software+Engineering+Research+and+Practice+%28SERP%29&amp;issn=&amp;date=2016-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=224&amp;au=Chen%2C+Chung-Yang%3BWu%2C+Kuo-Wei%3BLee%2C+Jung-Chieh&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=Proceedings+of+the+International+Conference+on+Software+Engineering+Research+and+Practice+%28SERP%29&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/";ProQuest Central,SciTech Premium Collection

Real-World Software Projects as Tools for the Improvement of Student Motivation and University-Industry Collaboration;  Conference Title: 2016 International Conference on Industrial Engineering, Management Science and Application (ICIMSA) Conference Start Date: 2016, May 23 Conference End Date: 2016, May 26 Conference Location: Jeju, South Korea Software engineering education has to deal with different challenges nowadays in Hungary. While the number of job offers in this field is continuously increasing the students' interest in programming shows a declining trend. The recognition of the problem led to several initiatives trying to address the existing lack of software engineers and student motivation in programming. This paper reports some of our successful attempts to reverse the unfavorable process. While some short-scale solutions like the usage of Lego mobile robots or team-based laboratory class assignments provided only short term lasting improvements the break-through was achieved by the help of a strong University-Industry collaboration. Real-world software projects as team-work assignments brought benefits for the students as well as for the university and the involved companies.

Teachers' perceptions of 21st-century instructional practices: Strategies, obstacles, and impact on teaching;The purpose of this mixed-methodology multi-case study was to explore high school English teachers' perceptions of and attitudes about 21st-century learning—their benefits, the challenges for effective implementation, and their impact on classroom instruction and learning. The researcher administered a survey, conducted focus groups and interviews, and analyzed archival data at two high schools identified by the Partnership for 21st Century Learning as exemplar schools implementing innovative learning practices. The primary and overriding finding of this study is that 21st-century instructional practices impact a high school English teacher's classroom instruction to a moderately high degree. Additional findings reveal the importance of communication and collaboration, a constructivist classroom, purposeful lessons, support for students who lack direction, a need for change in the educational system, and backing from within the school, as well as from parents, the school district, and the state.;1802308045;;;Dissertations & Theses;;Quigley, William George;;;" Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.";;; Dissertation/Thesis;;; 2016; 978-1-339-77747-4;;; English; English;;;;2016;ProQuest Dissertations and Theses;;2016;;;;https://search.proquest.com/docview/1802308045?accountid=11774;; 0401 Literature , 0449 Educational leadership , 0533 Secondary education , 0681 Rhetoric; 0401 Literature , 0449 Educational leadership , 0533 Secondary education , 0681 Rhetoric;; 0401 Literature , 0449 Educational leadership , 0533 Secondary education , 0681 Rhetoric;;; 0401 Literature , 0449 Educational leadership , 0533 Secondary education , 0681 Rhetoric; Literature , Educational leadership , Secondary education , Rhetoric , English , English teachers , 21st century , Cooperative learning , Teacher attitudes , Classroom communication , Parents & parenting , Teaching , Attitudes , Language history; Language, literature and linguistics , Education , 21st-century instructional practices , 21st-century learning skills , Constructivist classroom , Impact on teaching using technology , Obstacles for english teacers , Strategies for english teachers;;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:Education+Database&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Teachers%27+perceptions+of+21st-century+instructional+practices%3A+Strategies%2C+obstacles%2C+and+impact+on+teaching&amp;issn=&amp;date=2016-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Quigley%2C+William+George&amp;isbn=978-1-339-77747-4&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/";ProQuest Central,Social Science Premium Collection
(1) The case for using foreign language pedagogies in introductory computer programming instruction (2) A contextualized pre-AP computer programming curriculum: Models and simulations for exploring real-world cross-curricular topics;"Large numbers of novice programmers have been failing postsecondary introductory computer science programming (CS1) courses for nearly four decades. Student learning is much worse in secondary programming courses of similar or even lesser rigor. This has critical implications for efforts to reclassify Computer Science (CS) as a core secondary subject. State departments of education have little incentive to do so until it can be demonstrated that most grade-level students will not only pass such classes, but will be well-prepared to succeed in subsequent vertically aligned coursework. One rarely considered cause for such massive failure is insufficient pedagogic attention to teaching a programming language (PL) as a language, per se. Students who struggle with acquiring proficiency in using a PL can be likened to students who flounder in a French class due to a poor grasp of the language's syntactic or semantic features. Though natural languages (NL) and PLs differ in many key respects, a recently reported (2014) fMRI study has demonstrated that comprehension of computer programs primarily utilizes regions of the brain involved in language processing, not math. The implications for CS pedagogy are that, if PLs are learned in ways fundamentally similar to how second languages (L2) are acquired, foreign language pedagogies (FLP) and second language acquisition (SLA) theories can be key sources for informing the crafting of effective PL teaching strategies. In this regard, key features of contemporary L2 pedagogies relevant to effective PL instruction—reflecting the late 20 th -century shift in emphasis from cognitive learning that stressed grammatical knowledge, to one that facilitates communication and practical uses of the language—are: (1) repetitive and comprehensible input in a variety of contexts, and (2) motivated, meaningful communication and interaction. Informed by these principles, four language-based strategies adapted for PL instruction are described, the first to help students acquire syntax and three others for learning semantics: (a) memorization; (b) setting components in relief; (c) transformations; and (d) ongoing exposure. Anecdotal observations in my classroom have long indicated that memorization of small programs and program fragments can immediately and drastically reduce the occurrence of syntax errors among novice pre-AP Java programming students. A modest first experiment attempting to confirm the effect was statistically unconvincing: for students most likely to struggle, the Pearson coefficient of −0.474 (p &lt; 0.064) suggested a low-modest inverse correlation. A follow-up study will be better designed. Still, a possible explanation for the anecdotal phenomenon is that the repetition required for proficient memorization activates the same subconscious language acquisition processes that construct NL grammars when learners are exposed to language data. Dismal retention rates subsequent to the introductory programming course have historically also been a persistent problem. One key factor impacting attrition is a student's intrinsic motivation, which is shaped both by interest in, and self-efficacy with regards to, the subject matter. Interest involves not just CS concepts, but also context, the domains used to illustrate how one can apply those concepts. One way to tap into a wide range of student interests is to demonstrate the capacity of CS to explore, model, simulate and solve non-trivial problems in domains across the academic spectrum, fields that students already value and whose basic concepts they already understand. An original University of California ""G"" elective (UCOP ""a-g"" approved) pre-AP programming course along these principles is described. In this graphics-based Processing course, students are guided through the process of writing and studying small dynamic art programs, progressing to mid-size graphics programs that model or simulate real-world problems and phenomena in geography, biology, political science and astronomy. The contextualized course content combined with the language-specific strategies outlined above address both interest and self-efficacy. Although anecdotally these appear to have a positive effect on student understanding and retention, studies need to be done on a larger scale to validate these outcomes. Finally, a critique is offered of the movement to replace rigorous secondary programming instruction with survey courses—particularly Exploring Computer Science and APCS Principles —under the guise of ""democratizing"" secondary CS education or to address the severe and persistent demographic disparities. This group of educators has promulgated a nonsensical fiction that programming is simply one of many subdisciplines of the field, rather than the core skill needed to understand all other CS topics in any deep and meaningful way. These courses present a facade of mitigating demographic disparities, but leave participants no better prepared for subsequent CS study.";1800303403;;;Dissertations & Theses;;Portnoff, Scott R.;;;" Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.";;; Dissertation/Thesis;;; 2016; 978-1-339-89957-2;;; English; English;;;;2016;ProQuest Dissertations and Theses;;2016;;;;https://search.proquest.com/docview/1800303403?accountid=11774;; 0444 Foreign Language , 0727 Curriculum development , 0984 Computer science; 0444 Foreign Language , 0727 Curriculum development , 0984 Computer science;; 0444 Foreign Language , 0727 Curriculum development , 0984 Computer science;;; 0444 Foreign Language , 0727 Curriculum development , 0984 Computer science; Foreign Language , Curriculum development , Computer science; Applied sciences , Education , Computer science cs0 , Computer science curriculum , Computer science education , Computer science pedagogy , Novice programmer , Secondary computer science;;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:Education+Database&amp;atitle=&amp;title=%281%29+The+case+for+using+foreign+language+pedagogies+in+introductory+computer+programming+instruction+%282%29+A+contextualized+pre-AP+computer+programming+curriculum%3A+Models+and+simulations+for+exploring+real-world+cross-curricular+topics&amp;issn=&amp;date=2016-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Portnoff%2C+Scott+R.&amp;isbn=978-1-339-89957-2&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/";ProQuest Central,SciTech Premium Collection,Social Science Premium Collection
Continuous Assessment in Agile Learning using Visualizations and Clustering of Activity Data to Analyze Student Behavior;Software engineering education today is a technologically advanced and rapidly evolving discipline. Being a discipline where students not only design but also build new technology, it is important that they receive a hands on learning experience in the form of project based courses. To maximize the learning benefit, students must conduct project-based learning activities in a consistent rhythm, or cadence. Project-based courses that are augmented with a system of frequent, formative feedback helps students constantly evaluate their progress and leads them away from a deadline driven approach to learning. One aspect of this research is focused on evaluating the use of a tool that tracks student activity as a means of providing frequent, formative feedback. This thesis measures the impact of the tool on student compliance to the learning process. A personalized dashboard with quasi real time visual reports and notifications are provided to undergraduate and graduate software engineering students. The impact of these visual reports on compliance is measured using the log traces of dashboard activity and a survey instrument given multiple times during the course. A second aspect of this research is the application of learning analytics to understand patterns of student compliance. This research employs unsupervised machine learning algorithms to identify unique patterns of student behavior observed in the context of a project-based course. Analyzing and labeling these unique patterns of behavior can help instructors understand typical student characteristics. Further, understanding these behavioral patterns can assist an instructor in making timely, targeted interventions. In this research, datasets comprising of student’s daily activity and graded scores from an under graduate software engineering course is utilized for the purpose of identifying unique patterns of student behavior.;1796879300;;;Dissertations & Theses;;Xavier, Suhas;;;" Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.";;; Dissertation/Thesis;;; 2016; 978-1-339-83743-7;;; English; English;;;;2016;ProQuest Dissertations and Theses;;2016;;;;https://search.proquest.com/docview/1796879300?accountid=11774;; 0710 Educational technology , 0984 Computer science; 0710 Educational technology , 0984 Computer science;; 0710 Educational technology , 0984 Computer science;;; 0710 Educational technology , 0984 Computer science; Educational technology , Computer science; Applied sciences , Education , Agile learning , Continuous assessment , Project based courses , Unsupervised learning;;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:Education+Database&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Continuous+Assessment+in+Agile+Learning+using+Visualizations+and+Clustering+of+Activity+Data+to+Analyze+Student+Behavior&amp;issn=&amp;date=2016-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Xavier%2C+Suhas&amp;isbn=978-1-339-83743-7&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/";ProQuest Central,SciTech Premium Collection,Social Science Premium Collection
Maximizing Virtual MUCAx Engineering Design Team Performance;"Teams of design engineers are increasingly working as members of virtual teams, or teams whose members are distributed geographically and communicate mostly through electronic means. In addition, emerging multi-user (MU) applications engage complementary teams in synchronous design activities. These new MU tools are changing the way engineers work together. Together, these factors have created a new and interesting environment in which engineering design teams must function. The work presented here lays out two major themes that teams and their managers can effectively apply to organizing and managing MU teams: 1) teams can maximize their potential productivity by determining the optimal number of teammates for a given modeling effort and by implementing a profile and team formation system based on the principle of optimizing complementary team member characteristics; and 2) to minimize process losses, teams can implement effective strategies for working in a MU and/or virtual setting and they can use novel new MU tools that address portions of the product development process that have previously not been addressed with such tools. It is my hope that these contributions can enable greater effectiveness and productivity among virtual engineering design teams as they strive to remedy many of the most pressing and dire issues facing humanity. By improving the way we work together, we can increase our ability to bless all of God’s children.";1793670735;;;Dissertations & Theses;;Stone, Brett Randall;;;" Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.";;; Dissertation/Thesis;;; 2016; 978-1-339-71389-2;;; English; English;;;;2016;ProQuest Dissertations and Theses;;2016;;;;https://search.proquest.com/docview/1793670735?accountid=11774;; 0389 Design , 0464 Computer Engineering , 0548 Mechanical engineering , 0703 Organizational behavior; 0389 Design , 0464 Computer Engineering , 0548 Mechanical engineering , 0703 Organizational behavior;; 0389 Design , 0464 Computer Engineering , 0548 Mechanical engineering , 0703 Organizational behavior;;; 0389 Design , 0464 Computer Engineering , 0548 Mechanical engineering , 0703 Organizational behavior; Design , Computer Engineering , Mechanical engineering , Organizational behavior; Social sciences , Communication and the arts , Applied sciences , Engineering design , Multi-user Computer Aided Design , Teamwork , Virtual teams;;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:Matericals+Science+%26+Engineering+Dissertations&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Maximizing+Virtual+MUCAx+Engineering+Design+Team+Performance&amp;issn=&amp;date=2016-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Stone%2C+Brett+Randall&amp;isbn=978-1-339-71389-2&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/";SciTech Premium Collection
Characterize the Difficulties that International Computer Science Students Face;International Computer Science students, who form the majority of students in Engineering colleges in the U.S (Anderson, 2013), face a lot of difficulties and barriers that are unknown and unexpressed. Hiding these struggles may affect the quality of their education, and will repeat the struggles over and over with the coming students. We conducted a qualitative study to discover the barriers that international Computer Science students have and their special needs. The data was collected by interviewing international Computer Science students and some of their instructors in the University of Colorado at Colorado Springs (UCCS). The study found that international Computer Science students have English barriers evaluated on the following dimensions: listening and understanding lectures, participating and expressing ideas, presenting, writing, and reading. Moreover, students have identified another set of difficulties, which is technical barriers based on educational background and the ability to deal with advanced software tools.;1786281280;;;Dissertations & Theses;;Alharbi, Eman;;;" Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.";;; Dissertation/Thesis;;; 2016; 978-1-339-66108-7;;; English; English;;;;2016;ProQuest Dissertations and Theses;;2016;;;;https://search.proquest.com/docview/1786281280?accountid=11774;; 0515 Education , 0984 Computer science; 0515 Education , 0984 Computer science;; 0515 Education , 0984 Computer science;;; 0515 Education , 0984 Computer science; Education , Computer science; Applied sciences , Education , Computer science education , Computer science students’ needs , International education , International students , International students’ needs;;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:Education+Database&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Characterize+the+Difficulties+that+International+Computer+Science+Students+Face&amp;issn=&amp;date=2016-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Alharbi%2C+Eman&amp;isbn=978-1-339-66108-7&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/";ProQuest Central,SciTech Premium Collection,Social Science Premium Collection

Sometimes students get marked down inappropriately if their solutions do not follow the answer scheme. In addition, lab exercises and programming assignments are not necessary graded by the instructors but most of the time by the teaching assistants or lab demonstrators. This results in grading inconsistencies in terms of the marks awarded when the same solution is being graded by different person. To address this issue, a set of assessment rubric is necessary in order to provide flexibility for critical and creative solutions among students as well as to improve grading consistencies among instructors and teaching assistants or demonstrators. This paper reports the development of assessment rubric for each domain in computer programming courses; cognitive, psychomotor, and affective. The rubrics were then implemented for one academic semester consisting of 14 weeks.

Analyzing a dynamic curriculum change process to bridge the skills gap;"This research study provides a detailed account of how one college went about making continuous changes to their video game curriculum to generate a program that will prepare students with relevant skills sought by the dynamic tech industry. The changes were made despite some of the millennia-old constraints that colleges and universities abide by when updating curriculum. This thesis used a case study methodology conducted in a private, non-profit, non-tenure, open-enrollment college in the Northeast region of the United States. The research was conducted inside the Bachelor’s and Associate’s Degree programs in video game development. Data were collected from professors and administrators, document reviews, and investigator’s field notes. The resulting data were interpreted in an inductive manner. The key findings included the following themes: 1) Innovative ideas were introduced by an individual faculty member who then collaborated with peers and administrators to adopt the idea and integrate it into the curriculum; 2) Changes that were needed to fill the skills gap were identified by individual educators (faculty members or administrators) who then integrated both external industry views and internal college procedures to initiate curriculum modifications; 3) Industry involvement with the College, through faculty members reaching out to industry experts, was central to narrowing the skills gap; 4) Unceasing change in industry directions and needs required ongoing adjustments in internal college policy to bring about dynamic curricular change; 5) Dynamic curriculum change needs to be prompt, but well-paced, ranging from implementation in as short a time as one quarter to implementation in less than one year; 6) The culture and climate must be one of teamwork: honest thinkers, who trust, collaborate and unite to support shared goals. The overarching theme was that to bridge the skills gap, educators must innovate and become “social” by reaching out to industry experts, collaborating with other educators, and by conversing with students.";1780296167;;;Dissertations & Theses;;Saban, George;;;" Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.";;; Dissertation/Thesis;;; 2016; 978-1-339-59907-6;;; English; English;;;;2016;ProQuest Dissertations and Theses;;2016;;;;https://search.proquest.com/docview/1780296167?accountid=11774;; 0288 Educational tests & measurements , 0727 Curriculum development , 0745 Higher education; 0288 Educational tests & measurements , 0727 Curriculum development , 0745 Higher education;; 0288 Educational tests & measurements , 0727 Curriculum development , 0745 Higher education;;; 0288 Educational tests & measurements , 0727 Curriculum development , 0745 Higher education; Educational tests & measurements , Curriculum development , Higher education; Education , Bridging , Dynamic curriculum , Knowledge creation , Organizational learning , Skills gap , Work-ready graduates;;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:Education+Database&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Analyzing+a+dynamic+curriculum+change+process+to+bridge+the+skills+gap&amp;issn=&amp;date=2016-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Saban%2C+George&amp;isbn=978-1-339-59907-6&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/";ProQuest Central,Social Science Premium Collection

A Case Study on Undergraduate Entrepreneurial Constructivist Learning in Morocco;Jobs are available for university graduates with entrepreneurship skills, but unemployment in Morocco persists because of the dissociation between university entrepreneurship graduate skills and professional market demand. While university graduates have achieved academic standards, they have lacked the entrepreneurial attributes to be employable. The purpose of this case study was to explore the use of entrepreneurship learning initiatives at Université Internationale de Casablanca (UIC), a private for-profit university, to promote students’ employability. The constructivism and learning paradigm frameworks served as the theoretical foundations of this project study. The research questions addressed the effectiveness of entrepreneurship learning strategies in the promotion of students’ employment and self-employment and what challenged their implementation at UIC. Data were collected from 11 individual interviews with students, academic leaders, and business professionals and from accreditation application documents. The interviews were recorded, transcribed, and hand analyzed for the discovery of thematic codes. Results indicated that the implementation of a capstone project model could cultivate entrepreneurial student experience. It was recommended that comprehensive business plan capstone projects presented the opportunity of integrating experiential learning activities and assessment tools to develop the entrepreneurial mindset of undergraduate students and increase their affective attachment to the course and the university. Implications for social positive change included the use of entrepreneurship learning to foster internal collaboration among faculty, promote university external partnerships, and create an experiential learning environment that motivates students to learn and achieve professional immersion.;1765403835;;;Dissertations & Theses;;Benamar, Said;;;" Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.";;; Dissertation/Thesis;;; 2016; 978-1-339-45439-9;;; English; English;;;;2016;ProQuest Dissertations and Theses;;2016;;;;https://search.proquest.com/docview/1765403835?accountid=11774;; 0560 North African Studies , 0745 Higher education; 0560 North African Studies , 0745 Higher education;; 0560 North African Studies , 0745 Higher education;;; 0560 North African Studies , 0745 Higher education; North African Studies , Higher education; Social sciences , Education , Constructivism , Employability , Entrepreneurship , Learning paradigm , Morrocco , Professional immersion , Project capstone;;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:Education+Database&amp;atitle=&amp;title=A+Case+Study+on+Undergraduate+Entrepreneurial+Constructivist+Learning+in+Morocco&amp;issn=&amp;date=2016-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Benamar%2C+Said&amp;isbn=978-1-339-45439-9&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/";ProQuest Central,Social Science Premium Collection
Effects of Cohesion-Based Feedback on the Collaborations in Global Software Development Teams;This paper describes a study that examines the effect of cohesion-based feedback on a team member’s behaviors in a global software development project. Chat messages and forum posts were collected from a software development project involving students living in the US and Mexico. Half of the teams in the project received feedback in the form of a graphical representation that displayed the group’s cohesion level, while the other teams received no feedback. The nature of the group interactions as well as the linguistic content of such interactions was then analyzed and compared. Results from this analysis show statistically significant differences between the feedback and non-feedback c onditions. More s pecifically, cohesion-based feedback had a positive relation to a team’s total message count, response rate, and individual cohesion score. In addition, the analysis of linguistic categories showed that the most salient categories observed were related to words about time and work. Furthermore, a comparison between feedback variables and type (i.e., positive and negative feedback) indicates that those individuals exposed to negative feedback had an increase in their communication pacing rates when exposed to positive feedback. Although the feedback system did not appear to affect individual performance, the findings s u ggest t h at t h e c o hesion m e asure d e fined in th is st ud y is positively correlated to the task cohesion construct and is also related to individual and team performance.;2306217079;;;Scholarly Journals;;"Castro-Hernández, Alberto;Swigger, Kathleen;Ponce-Flores, Mirna P";;; © 2015.

Assessment proposal of teaching and learning strategies in software process improvement/Propuesta de evaluación de estrategias de enseñanza/aprendizaje en mejora de procesos software;"  Teaching and learning environments of software process improvement are incorporating new strategies for helping to decrease current weaknesses related to basic-sciences formation, motivation, and communication. One of such strategies includes the usage of gamification principles for achieving student competencies related to teamwork, problem solving, leadership, and effective communication. For assessing the teaching and learning strategies, it is required to consider the following features: i) the student competencies; ii) the didactic proposals and techniques; and, iii) the satisfaction level of the students, regarding the teaching strategy. In this paper, an assessment proposal of teaching and learning strategies in software process improvement is presented, with a preliminary validation method based on gamification principles. Finally, a case study for validating a didactic proposal is presented as a pilot of the assessment proposal.";1784867286;;;Scholarly Journals;;"Manrique-Losada, Bell;Gasca-Hurtado, Gloria Piedad;Álvarez, María Clara Gómez";;; Copyright Universidad de Antioquia Dec 2015;; 10.17533/udea.redin.n77a13; Feature;;; Dec 2015;;0120-6230;77; English; English;; 105-114; Medellín;Dec 2015;Revista Facultad de Ingeniería Universidad de Antioquia;;2015;;;;https://search.proquest.com/docview/1784867286?accountid=11774;;;; References , Diagrams , Illustrations , Tables;;; 105;; Case studies , Learning , Students , Teaching , Taxonomy , Problem solving , Communication , Principles , Teamwork , Cooperation , Data collection , Software engineering , Software quality , Proposals , Feedback , Mechanics , Defects , Questionnaires , Gamification;;;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aengineeringjournals&amp;atitle=Assessment+proposal+of+teaching+and+learning+strategies+in+software+process+improvement%2FPropuesta+de+evaluaci%C3%B3n+de+estrategias+de+ense%C3%B1anza%2Faprendizaje+en+mejora+de+procesos+software&amp;title=Revista+Facultad+de+Ingenier%C3%ADa+Universidad+de+Antioquia&amp;issn=01206230&amp;date=2015-12-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=77&amp;spage=105&amp;au=Manrique-Losada%2C+Bell%3BGasca-Hurtado%2C+Gloria+Piedad%3B%C3%81lvarez%2C+Mar%C3%ADa+Clara+G%C3%B3mez&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=Revista+Facultad+de+Ingenier%C3%ADa+Universidad+de+Antioquia&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/10.17533%2Fudea.redin.n77a13";ProQuest Central,SciTech Premium Collection

Serious computer games in computer science education;The role and importance of serious computer games in contemporary educational practice is presented in this paper as well as the theoretical fundamentals that justify their use in different forms of education. We present a project for designing and developing serious games that take place within the curriculum for computer science teachers’ education as an independent project work in teams. In this project work students have to use their knowledge in the field of didactics and computer science to develop games. The developed game is tested and evaluated in schools in the framework of their practical training. The results of the evaluation can help students improve their games and verify to which extent specified learning goals have been achieved.;2306502259;;;Scholarly Journals;;Rugelj, Jože;;; © 2015.

Teaching Tip: Managing Software Engineering Student Teams Using Pellerin's 4-D System;In this article, we discuss the use of Pellerin's Four Dimension Leadership System (4-D) as a way to manage teams in a classroom setting. Over a 5-year period, we used a modified version of the 4-D model to manage teams within a senior level Software Engineering capstone course. We found that this approach for team management in a classroom setting led to qualitatively fewer incidents of teams unable to effectively work together, better projects, and greater group cohesion. In this article, we discuss our experience using the 4-D System, which was not originally designed for use in the classroom. We find our modified version of the 4-D System to be viable in a classroom setting and provide the reader with everything needed to implement 4-D in his or her own course.;1871582787; EJ1113948;;Scholarly Journals;;"Doman, Marguerite;Besmer, Andrew;Olsen, Anne";;;;;; Article , Undefined , Report , 080: Journal Articles , 160: Tests/Questionnaires , 141: Reports - Descriptive;;; Oct 2015 - Dec 2015;;1055-3096;4; English; English;; 257-264;;Oct 2015 - Dec 2015;Journal of Information Systems Education; Scholarly Journals , Other Sources , Reports;2015; http://www.jise.org; ERIC, © Journal of Information Systems Education;26;https://search.proquest.com/docview/1871582787?accountid=11774;;;;;;; 257;;  3488ER5 8290ER5 3164ER5  3474 8260 3150 ,  2065ER5 5172ER5 8290ER5 3164ER5  2054 5155 8260 3150 ,  2070ER5  2059 ,  8359ER5 2064ER5 5171ER5 9385ER5 5983ER5  8328 2053 5154 9351 5964 ,  5891ER5 912ER5  5872 909 ,  10685ER5 4527ER5 912ER5  10642 4511 909 ,  2236ER5 5901ER5  2225 5882 ,  1611ER5 3204ER5 3532ER5  1604 3190 3518 ,  1774ER5 2526ER5  1765 2515 ,  4532ER5 5365ER5 8800ER5  4516 5348 8768 ,  3256ER5  3242 ,  3278ER5 3241ER5 6603ER5  3264 3227 6582 ,  8319ER5 153ER5 4413ER5  8288 153 4398; Higher Education , Postsecondary Education , Teachers;;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aeric&amp;atitle=Teaching+Tip%3A+Managing+Software+Engineering+Student+Teams+Using+Pellerin%27s+4-D+System&amp;title=Journal+of+Information+Systems+Education&amp;issn=10553096&amp;date=2015-10-01&amp;volume=26&amp;issue=4&amp;spage=257&amp;au=Doman%2C+Marguerite%3BBesmer%2C+Andrew%3BOlsen%2C+Anne&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=Journal+of+Information+Systems+Education&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/EJ1113948&amp;rft_id=info:doi/";Social Science Premium Collection

ARCHITECTURE KNOWLEDGE FLOW FRAMEWORK DESGIN;  Flow of Knowledge pertains in most teamwork and it attracts the researchers in the field of knowledge management. Since flow of knowledge usually happens in a particular context, context has to be taken into consideration in knowledge flow modeling. Past models of flow of knowledge lacked in terms of software development and lacked in-depth exploration of context modeling, which made those models less applicable. This research proposes a conceptual framework of context oriented flow of knowledge in software development aspects. In this framework, the context is seen as an inseparable element of flow of knowledge, which is regarding the creation, transformation as well as application of knowledge items. Framework KFFD is proposed based on three aspects- flow of knowledge, software development project and ontology. For the proper use of knowledge, dynamic flow to destinations form sources is necessary. In this context, a new framework in KM is analyzing, designing and implementing knowledge flow management systems. One crucial challenge in such systems is the exploration of flow of knowledge from its origin to the receiver. Another challenge is controlling the flow for quality enhancements regarding the requirements of the users. As such, the aim of this research is to provide a framework so as to solve this challenge.;1779938908;;;Scholarly Journals;;"Khalefa, Mustafa S;Jabar, Marzanah A;Abdullah, Rusli H J;Abdullah, Salfarina";;; Copyright Journal of Theoretical and Applied Information Sep 2015;;; Feature;;; Sep 2015;;1817-3195;2; English; English;; 261-271; Islamabad;Sep 2015;Journal of Theoretical and Applied Information Technology;;2015;;;79;https://search.proquest.com/docview/1779938908?accountid=11774;;;; Illustrations , Charts , References;;; 261;;;;;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Acomputerinfo&amp;atitle=ARCHITECTURE+KNOWLEDGE+FLOW+FRAMEWORK+DESGIN&amp;title=Journal+of+Theoretical+and+Applied+Information+Technology&amp;issn=18173195&amp;date=2015-09-01&amp;volume=79&amp;issue=2&amp;spage=261&amp;au=Khalefa%2C+Mustafa+S%3BJabar%2C+Marzanah+A%3BAbdullah%2C+Rusli+H+J%3BAbdullah%2C+Salfarina&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=Journal+of+Theoretical+and+Applied+Information+Technology&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/";SciTech Premium Collection
Distributed collaborative homework activities in a problem-based usability engineering course;"  Teams of students in an upper-division undergraduate Usability Engineering course used a collaborative environment to carry out a series of three distributed collaborative homework assignments. Assignments were case-based analyses structured using a jigsaw design; students were provided a collaborative software environment and introduced to a simple model of collaboration. We found that students were able to use the collaboration model, though the quality of their collaboration was poor both before and after training. We found that students were able to carry out the distributed collaborative homework activities using our collaborative software environment, though they often used, and sometimes relied on face-to-face interactions.

Distributed Pair Programming Using Collaboration Scripts: An Educational System and Initial Results;  Since pair programming appeared in the literature as an effective method of teaching computer programming, many systems were developed to cover the application of pair programming over distance. Today's systems serve personal, professional and educational purposes allowing distributed teams to work together on the same programming project. The current research focuses in distributed pair programming systems which are suitable for supporting students in learning computer programming. Systematic review of publicly available systems revealed that there is an absence of effective collaboration support for the students. The main drawbacks of pair programming, such as uneven workload distribution and infrequent role switches, cannot be addressed with available systems. While building an enhanced version of a distributed pair programming system, successful instructional strategies in similar collaborative learning systems were explored, in order to improve students' interactions when applying pair programming over distance. As a result, the new system allows students to practice distributed pair programming in the form of collaboration scripts. This paper presents the features and the underlying concepts of the system, and the results of its first evaluation. The study showed that distributed pair programming attracted positive feedback from students, and that scripted collaboration affected students' engagement in programming, and resulted in an evenly distribution of learning objectives among pairs.;1789215025;;;Scholarly Journals;;"Tsompanoudi, Despina;Satratzemi, Maya;Xinogalos, Stelios";;; Copyright Institute of Mathematics and Informatics 2015;;; Feature;;; 2015;;1648-5831;2; English; English;; 291-314; Vilnius;2015;Informatics in Education;;2015;;;14;https://search.proquest.com/docview/1789215025?accountid=11774;;;; References;;; 291;; Computer programming , Educational technology;;;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aeducation&amp;atitle=Distributed+Pair+Programming+Using+Collaboration+Scripts%3A+An+Educational+System+and+Initial+Results&amp;title=Informatics+in+Education&amp;issn=16485831&amp;date=2015-07-01&amp;volume=14&amp;issue=2&amp;spage=291&amp;au=Tsompanoudi%2C+Despina%3BSatratzemi%2C+Maya%3BXinogalos%2C+Stelios&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=Informatics+in+Education&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/";ProQuest Central,SciTech Premium Collection,Social Science Premium Collection
Induction of Interactive Methods to Teach Software Engineering Course;  Software engineering (SE) field is considered as a backbone of software industry. Students suffer many problems and difficulties when they approach to industry due to the old contents of SE course, lack of practice and inability in the subject area. The main reason of the SE course problems is the lack of coordination or gap between software industry and academia. This paper proposed a novel solution to enhance SE curriculum to bridge the gap between industry and academia. The proposed solution will assist students at optimal level in their professional careers to achieve goals of SE course. Survey research methodology is used to evaluate the proposed solution and the results of data analysis are highly encouraging. It is anticipated that the universities will find this research helpful to improve the quality of SE course.;1770060106;;;Scholarly Journals;;"Alahmadi, Eman S;M Rizwan Jameel Qureshi";;; Copyright Modern Education and Computer Science Press Jun 2015;; 10.5815/ijmecs.2015.06.07; Feature;;; Jun 2015;;2075-0161;6; English; English;; 43-49; Hong Kong;Jun 2015;International Journal of Modern Education and Computer Science;;2015;;;7;https://search.proquest.com/docview/1770060106?accountid=11774;;;; References;;; 43;; Software engineering , Teaching , Computer science , Curricula , Higher education; Software engineering , education , industry , curriculum , mental-map;;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aeducation&amp;atitle=Induction+of+Interactive+Methods+to+Teach+Software+Engineering+Course&amp;title=International+Journal+of+Modern+Education+and+Computer+Science&amp;issn=20750161&amp;date=2015-06-01&amp;volume=7&amp;issue=6&amp;spage=43&amp;au=Alahmadi%2C+Eman+S%3BM+Rizwan+Jameel+Qureshi&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=International+Journal+of+Modern+Education+and+Computer+Science&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/10.5815%2Fijmecs.2015.06.07";ProQuest Central,SciTech Premium Collection,Social Science Premium Collection
INCORPORATING SOFTWARE MAINTENANCE IN A SENIOR CAPSTONE PROJECT;  Software engineering capstone projects give students experience in developing a software product throughout the software life cycle. Projects such as these give students practical experience in applying concepts they have learned in their software engineering and computer science classes. This paper presents a software engineering capstone project conducted by students at the University of Virginia's College at Wise. The work of the students is documented in this paper. Unlike previous capstone projects conducted at this university, this one uses methods commonly found in agile development and is an adaptive maintenance development effort.;1689386463;;;Scholarly Journals;;"Weissberger, Ira;Qureshi, Abrar;Chowhan, Assad;Collins, Ethan;Gallimore, Dakota";;; Copyright Academy of Taiwan Information Systems Research Jun 2015;;; Feature;;; Jun 2015;;1995-6649;1; English; English;; 31-38; Taipei;Jun 2015;International Journal of Cyber Society and Education;;2015;;;8;https://search.proquest.com/docview/1689386463?accountid=11774;;;; Tables , References;;; 31;;;;;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Ahightechjournals&amp;atitle=INCORPORATING+SOFTWARE+MAINTENANCE+IN+A+SENIOR+CAPSTONE+PROJECT&amp;title=International+Journal+of+Cyber+Society+and+Education&amp;issn=19956649&amp;date=2015-06-01&amp;volume=8&amp;issue=1&amp;spage=31&amp;au=Weissberger%2C+Ira%3BQureshi%2C+Abrar%3BChowhan%2C+Assad%3BCollins%2C+Ethan%3BGallimore%2C+Dakota&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=International+Journal+of+Cyber+Society+and+Education&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/";ProQuest Central,SciTech Premium Collection
Requirements engineering education: a systematic mapping study;  Requirements engineering (RE) has attracted a great deal of attention from researchers and practitioners in recent years. Requirements engineering education (REE) is therefore an important undertaking if the field is to have professionals who are capable of successfully accomplishing software projects. This increasing interest demands that academia should provide software engineering students with a solid foundation in the subject matter. This paper aims to identify and to present the current research on REE that is available at present, and to select useful approaches and needs for future research. A systematic mapping study was therefore performed to classify the selected studies into five classification criteria: research type, empirical type, contribution type, RE activity, and curricula. A total of 79 papers were selected and classified according to these criteria. The results of this systematic mapping study are discussed, and a list of advice obtained from the REE literature for instructors is provided.;1680106220;;;Scholarly Journals;;"Ouhbi, Sofia;Idri, Ali;Fernández-alemán, José Luis;Toval, Ambrosio";;; Springer-Verlag London 2015;; 10.1007/s00766-013-0192-5; Feature;;; Jun 2015;;0947-3602;2; English; English;; 119-138; London;Jun 2015;Requirements Engineering;;2015;;;20;https://search.proquest.com/docview/1680106220?accountid=11774;;;; References;;; 119;; Requirements analysis , Software engineering , Technology education;;;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Asciencejournals&amp;atitle=Requirements+engineering+education%3A+a+systematic+mapping+study&amp;title=Requirements+Engineering&amp;issn=09473602&amp;date=2015-06-01&amp;volume=20&amp;issue=2&amp;spage=119&amp;au=Ouhbi%2C+Sofia%3BIdri%2C+Ali%3BFern%C3%A1ndez-alem%C3%A1n%2C+Jos%C3%A9+Luis%3BToval%2C+Ambrosio&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=Requirements+Engineering&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/10.1007%2Fs00766-013-0192-5";ProQuest Central,SciTech Premium Collection
A course on serious game design and development using an online problem-based learning approach;Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to describe a novel undergraduate course on serious game design and development that integrates both game and instructional design, thus providing an effective approach to teaching serious game design and development. Very little effort has been dedicated to the teaching of proper serious game design and development leading to many examples of serious games that provide little, if any, educational value. Design/methodology/approach – Organized around a collection of video clips (that provided a brief contextualized overview of the topic and questions for further exploration), readings, interdisciplinary research projects and games, the course introduced the principles of game and instructional design, educational theories used to support game-based learning and methods for evaluating serious games. Discussions and activities supported the problems that students worked on throughout the course to develop a critical stance and approach toward implementing game-based learning. Students designed serious games and examined potential issues and complexities involved in developing serious games and incorporating them within a teaching curriculum. Findings – Results of student course evaluations reveal that the course was fun and engaging. Students found the course fun and engaging, and through the successful completion of the final course project, all students met all of the course objectives. A discussion regarding the techniques and approaches used in the course that were successful (or unsuccessful) is provided. Research limitations/implications – It should be noted that a more detailed analysis has not been presented to fully demonstrate the effectiveness of the course. A more detailed analysis may have included a comparison with, for example, past versions of the course that was not based on an online problem-based learning (PBL) approach, to better quantify the effectiveness of the course. However, such a comparison could not be carried out here, given there was no measure of prior knowledge of students taken before they took course (e.g. no “pre-test data”). Originality/value – Unlike the few existing courses dedicated to serious game design, the course was designed specifically to facilitate a fully online PBL approach and provided students the opportunity to take control of their own learning through active research, exploration and problem-solving alone, in groups and through facilitated class discussions.;2093343591;;;Scholarly Journals; Faculty of Business and Information Technology, University of Ontario Institute of Technology, Oshawa, Canada , Faculty of Education, York University, Toronto, Canada , Faculty of Education, University of Ontario Institute of Technology, Oshawa, Canada , Faculty of Education, University of Ontario Institute of Technology, Oshawa, Canada;"Kapralos, Bill;Fisher, Stephanie;Clarkson, Jessica;Roland van Oostveen";;; © Emerald Group Publishing Limited 2015;; 10.1108/ITSE-10-2014-0033; Case Study;;; 2015;;1741-5659;2; English; English;; 116-136; Bingley;2015;Interactive Technology and Smart Education;;2015;;;12;https://search.proquest.com/docview/2093343591?accountid=11774;;;;;;; 116;; Research , Simulation , Students , Computer & video games , Teaching methods , Intercultural communication , Exploration , Electronic & video games , Education , Instructional design , Interdisciplinary aspects , Teaching methods , Curricula , Distance learning , Interdisciplinary studies , Systematic review , Learning , Research projects , Problem solving , Students , Skills , Designers; Instructional design , Undergraduates , Problem-based learning , Simulation , Online , Teaching methods , Distance learning , Video games , Serious games , Game design;;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=unknown&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aeducation&amp;atitle=A+course+on+serious+game+design+and+development+using+an+online+problem-based+learning+approach&amp;title=Interactive+Technology+and+Smart+Education&amp;issn=17415659&amp;date=2015-04-01&amp;volume=12&amp;issue=2&amp;spage=116&amp;au=Kapralos%2C+Bill%3BFisher%2C+Stephanie%3BClarkson%2C+Jessica%3BRoland+van+Oostveen&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=Interactive+Technology+and+Smart+Education&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/10.1108%2FITSE-10-2014-0033";ProQuest Central,SciTech Premium Collection,Social Science Premium Collection
"A proactive, experiential and student-centered learning approach: A case study of the effects of a social media video editing ""App"" in a traditional classroom setting";"The use of social media App’s has exploded in recent years. The purpose of this case study was to explore the use and implications of a social media App for shooting and editing video, when used in a higher education classroom where video projects are required. The study examined how the use of a student-centered App — in place of more traditional video and editing instruction — effected the student-learner model. The research questions included: RQ1 How does a social media video App impact student learning in a traditional higher education classroom? RQ2 What is the impact of a social media video App on the collaborative student-centered process? RQ3 Why does a social media video App enhance student-centered learning outcomes? The study used observation, in-depth individual participant interviews and a focus group of participants. The study found that participants favored the use of a video App for learning. Moreover, the case study pointed to a preference for collaborative, experiential student-centered learning. This self-directed and peer-involving learning approach resulted in more creative solutions, with participant benefits grouped into three themes: first, interaction was enhanced, with students reaching out to each other and voluntarily increasing use of digital tools; second, collaboration increased, with the increasingly iterative cycles of problem-solving involving both participant peers and digital tools; and, third, creation of assignment solutions that were experiential in nature, resembling the more complex and professional digital products of produced by organizations outside the classrooms.";1757808203;;;Dissertations & Theses;;Kirk, Bruce Martin;;;" Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.";;; Dissertation/Thesis;;; 2015; 978-1-339-20620-2;;; English; English;;;;2015;ProQuest Dissertations and Theses;;2015;;;;https://search.proquest.com/docview/1757808203?accountid=11774;; 0459 Communication , 0646 Web Studies , 0710 Educational technology , 0745 Higher education; 0459 Communication , 0646 Web Studies , 0710 Educational technology , 0745 Higher education;; 0459 Communication , 0646 Web Studies , 0710 Educational technology , 0745 Higher education;;; 0459 Communication , 0646 Web Studies , 0710 Educational technology , 0745 Higher education; Communication , Web Studies , Educational technology , Higher education;" Communication and the arts , Education , Applications ""app's"" , Constructivism , Experiential , Social media , Student-centered , Technology";;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:Social+Science+Database&amp;atitle=&amp;title=A+proactive%2C+experiential+and+student-centered+learning+approach%3A+A+case+study+of+the+effects+of+a+social+media+video+editing+%22App%22+in+a+traditional+classroom+setting&amp;issn=&amp;date=2015-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Kirk%2C+Bruce+Martin&amp;isbn=978-1-339-20620-2&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/";ProQuest Central,Social Science Premium Collection
Gamification in Introductory Computer Science;This thesis investigates the impact of gamification on student motivation and learning in several introductory computer science educational activities. The use of game design techniques in education offers the potential to make learning more motivating and more enjoyable for students. However, the design, implementation, and evaluation of game elements that actually realize this promise remains a largely unmet challenge. This research examines whether the introduction of game elements into curriculum positively impacts student motivation and intended learning outcomes for entry-level computer science education in four settings that apply similar game design techniques in different introductory computer science educational settings. The results of these studies are evaluated using mixed methods to compare the effects of game elements on student motivation and learning in both formal and non-formal learning environments.;1752479755;;;Dissertations & Theses;;Behnke, Kara Alexandra;;;" Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.";;; Dissertation/Thesis;;; 2015; 978-1-339-36399-8;;; English; English;;;;2015;ProQuest Dissertations and Theses;;2015;;;;https://search.proquest.com/docview/1752479755?accountid=11774;; 0710 Educational technology , 0984 Computer science; 0710 Educational technology , 0984 Computer science;; 0710 Educational technology , 0984 Computer science;;; 0710 Educational technology , 0984 Computer science; Educational technology , Computer science; Applied sciences , Education , Computer science principles , Cs1 , Gamification , Introductory computer science , Motivation , Self-determination theory;;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:Education+Database&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Gamification+in+Introductory+Computer+Science&amp;issn=&amp;date=2015-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Behnke%2C+Kara+Alexandra&amp;isbn=978-1-339-36399-8&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/";ProQuest Central,Social Science Premium Collection
A STATE OF THE ART MATRIX ANALYSIS ON MULTI-PROJECT MANAGEMENT IN CAPSTONE SENIOR DESIGN COURSES;  Multi-project management can be challenging for organizations. The school of Mechanical Industrial and Manufacturing Engineering at Oregon State University teaches a Capstone Senior Design Course aimed at preparing students for real world engineering problem solving through group collaboration. The goal of these projects range from building a rocket to implementing lean tools. The instructor, in charge of the course, manages all of these teams using a newly implemented Web site tool. In order to improve this tool, and the class as a whole, the State-of-the-Art Matrix Analysis methodology will be used to break down, analyze and compare historical and modern ideas and practices of capstone classroom management. This study will place special attention on literature containing classrooms with a large variety of projects as well as current technologies and the methods with which they are utilized. Engineering managers concerned with multi-project management will find best practices and tools for analyzing and maintaining several projects at once.;1751245827;;;Conference Papers & Proceedings;;"McGrath, John O;Calvo-Amodio, Javier, PhD";;; Copyright American Society for Engineering Management (ASEM) 2015;;; Feature;;; 2015;;;; English; English;; 1-8; Huntsville;2015;Proceedings of the International Annual Conference of the American Society for Engineering Management.;;2015;;;;https://search.proquest.com/docview/1751245827?accountid=11774;;;; Tables , References;;; 1;;;;;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aabiglobal&amp;atitle=A+STATE+OF+THE+ART+MATRIX+ANALYSIS+ON+MULTI-PROJECT+MANAGEMENT+IN+CAPSTONE+SENIOR+DESIGN+COURSES&amp;title=Proceedings+of+the+International+Annual+Conference+of+the+American+Society+for+Engineering+Management.&amp;issn=&amp;date=2015-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=1&amp;au=McGrath%2C+John+O%3BCalvo-Amodio%2C+Javier%2C+PhD&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=Proceedings+of+the+International+Annual+Conference+of+the+American+Society+for+Engineering+Management.&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/";ProQuest Central,SciTech Premium Collection
Improving peer learning and knowledge sharing in STEM courses via pattern based graph visualization;"High quality education in Science, Technology, Engineering and Math (STEM) majors expects not only the acquisition of comprehensive domain knowledge, but also the mastery of skills to solve open-ended and even ill-defined problems in real world. Problem-based Learning (PBL) is usually adopted to achieve such goals by encouraging students to learn by solving real-life problems. However, successful PBL requires sustained and in-depth involvement of faculty members, hence making PBL not scalable. Even though discussion forums and Q&amp;A systems can help address the scalability problem of faculty involvement on large class sizes, it introduces new problems. First, as knowledge bases grow in size, the sheer size of the accumulated knowledge makes it harder to locate the desired information. Second, existing knowledge discovery techniques do not provide effective facilities for the capture and reuse of solutions to recurring problems. To address these challenges, we developed MicroBrowser, an innovative and interactive Question &amp; Answer (Q&amp;A) system augmented with pattern-based expertise-sharing interfaces and 2D knowledge graph discussion visualization. MicroBrowser provides a set of pattern-based expertise-sharing interfaces to allow both learners and instructors to refine, reuse, and share knowledge. MicroBrowser also allows learners to browse and navigate important discussions based on topic similarity encoded by node proximity in a knowledge graph. Results of empirical evaluations of our proposed solution show that ask difficulty improves with MicroBrowser when compared with a state-of-the-art Q&amp;A system for knowledge discovery and reuse tasks. In addition, success rate for knowledge discovery tasks using keywords was higher with MicroBrowser. Moreover, we show that, students found the patternbased expertise-sharing interface easy to use and were able to contribute new knowledge in the form of new knowledge connections and even recommend new design patterns.";1749026589;;;Dissertations & Theses;;Zegarra, Emilio Francisco;;;" Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.";;; Dissertation/Thesis;;; 2015; 978-1-339-24717-5;;; English; English;;;;2015;ProQuest Dissertations and Theses;;2015;;;;https://search.proquest.com/docview/1749026589?accountid=11774;; 0710 Educational technology , 0984 Computer science; 0710 Educational technology , 0984 Computer science;; 0710 Educational technology , 0984 Computer science;;; 0710 Educational technology , 0984 Computer science; Educational technology , Computer science; Applied sciences , Education , Expertise sharing , Graph visualization , Knowledge discovery , Peer learning , STEM education;;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:Education+Database&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Improving+peer+learning+and+knowledge+sharing+in+STEM+courses+via+pattern+based+graph+visualization&amp;issn=&amp;date=2015-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Zegarra%2C+Emilio+Francisco&amp;isbn=978-1-339-24717-5&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/";ProQuest Central,Social Science Premium Collection
Barriers to Computer Programming Student Success: A Quantitative Study of Community College Students in Southwest Missouri;Student success in computer programming courses has been a long-studied problem and computer science major retention has historically been substantially lower than other majors. The issue of retention for computer science majors has become more pronounced in two-year, open-enrollment institutions. This quantitative study, grounded in Gardner’s theory of multiple intelligences, attempted to address some of the causes of poor retention for entry-level computer science majors at two-year colleges by looking for predictors of student success in their first computer programming course. Two of the intelligences from Gardner’s (1993) theory, Logical-Mathematical and Visual-Spatial, were used along with two factors: student success in previous mathematics courses and the student’s own perception of his or her programming skill. Three research questions guided the study and a survey instrument was developed to evaluate student success factors such as the number of credit hours enrolled and the amount of time spent on homework. Secondary data were obtained from the institution, which contained grades from math and programming courses. After analysis of the data, results indicated there was not a statistically significant difference in student success in entry-level computer programming classes after having taken at least a college-level math course. There was a significant different found for students who had completed an intermediate-level math class before taking their programming course. The findings of this study may be used to help two-year community college administrators determine the benefits of higher prerequisites for beginning programming courses to increase retention and student success.;1734466573;;;Dissertations & Theses;;Ford, Tiffany D.;;;" Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.";;; Dissertation/Thesis;;; 2015; 978-1-339-18768-6;;; English; English;;;;2015;ProQuest Dissertations and Theses;;2015;;;;https://search.proquest.com/docview/1734466573?accountid=11774;; 0984 Computer science; 0984 Computer science;; 0984 Computer science;;; 0984 Computer science; Computer science; Applied sciences , Computer programming , Computer science , Gardner's multiple intelligence;;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:Publicly+Available+Content+Database&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Barriers+to+Computer+Programming+Student+Success%3A+A+Quantitative+Study+of+Community+College+Students+in+Southwest+Missouri&amp;issn=&amp;date=2015-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Ford%2C+Tiffany+D.&amp;isbn=978-1-339-18768-6&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/";ProQuest Central
A Systematic Survey on Waterfall Vs. Agile Vs. Lean Process Paradigms;  We intend to highlight the key features and future directions in the research community of waterfall, agile and lean process paradigms from 2001 to 2014, exemplifying how research on waterfall, agile and lean has progressively increased in the past fourteen years by inspecting articles and papers from scientific and standard publications. Survey materialized in three fold process. Firstly, the authors have investigated on the amalgamation of waterfall, agile and then proceeded with agile-lean. Secondly, they have performed a structural analysis on different author's prominent contributions in the form of tabulation by categories and graphical representation. Thirdly, they huddle with conceptual similarity in the field and also impart a summary table on all process models. In the context of agile, monitoring bottlenecks such as business values and high speed projects, beyond the capacity performed into an organization (CMMI levels) is not clearly defined. But by incorporating lean and agile principles, high quality products can be produced with low cost and desired speed can be achieved in the delivery of projects with optimal capacity. Further, it delivers conclusions by conferring future research directions in the field of software engineering paradigm, such as reducing errors early in the software development process, combining manufacturing principles with lean or agile or both rather than a solo model for providing high quality results. One such type of principle called Poka-Yoke (PY) is a mistake proofing technique used in product design and improves the software development process by integrating software engineering paradigm. A new approach for implementation of Poka-Yoke method in software performance engineering is proposed.;1728276011;;;Scholarly Journals;;"Baseer, K K;A Rama Mohan Reddy;C Shoba Bindu";;; 2015 i-manager publications.

Creating Synergy between Undergraduate Senior Computing Research and Applied Capstone Courses;  This study presents a look at the synergy created between two undergraduate computing courses in the Computing and Technology Department at Cameron University - MIS 4473 Current Topics in IT, and IT 4444 IT Capstone. The focus of MIS 4473 was student group case study research, utilizing: (a) the success of Computing and Technology faculty academic publications, (b) guidelines from an international computing conference, (c) an iterative writing and editing process, and (d) a blind student peer review process. The focus of IT 4444 was applied multi-discipline systems software development in a service learning capacity for real clients. Students in MIS 4473 conducted case study research on concurrent IT 4444 capstone projects and presented findings at the end of the semester, thereby simulating the computing conference experience. The authors discuss the necessity of such synergy in relation to improved student research skills and service learning reflection.;1705980286;;;Conference Papers & Proceedings;;"Estep, M;Smith, K D;Zhao, C;Johari, A;Carney, W";;; Copyright The Steering Committee of The World Congress in Computer Science, Computer Engineering and Applied Computing (WorldComp) 2015;;; Feature;;; 2015;;;; English; English;; 162-167; Athens;2015;Proceedings of the International Conference on Frontiers in Education: Computer Science and Computer Engineering (FECS);;2015;;;;https://search.proquest.com/docview/1705980286?accountid=11774;;;; References;;; 162;;;;;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Ahightechjournals&amp;atitle=Creating+Synergy+between+Undergraduate+Senior+Computing+Research+and+Applied+Capstone+Courses&amp;title=Proceedings+of+the+International+Conference+on+Frontiers+in+Education%3A+Computer+Science+and+Computer+Engineering+%28FECS%29&amp;issn=&amp;date=2015-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=162&amp;au=Estep%2C+M%3BSmith%2C+K+D%3BZhao%2C+C%3BJohari%2C+A%3BCarney%2C+W&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=Proceedings+of+the+International+Conference+on+Frontiers+in+Education%3A+Computer+Science+and+Computer+Engineering+%28FECS%29&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/";ProQuest Central,SciTech Premium Collection
Motivation and Learning of Non-Traditional Computing Education Students in a Web-Based Combined Laboratory;Hands-on experiential learning activities are an important component of computing education disciplines. Laboratory environments provide learner access to real world equipment for completing experiments. Local campus facilities are commonly used to host laboratory classes. While campus facilities afford hands-on experience with real equipment high maintenance costs, restricted access, and limited flexibility diminish laboratory effectiveness. Web-based simulation and remote laboratory formats have emerged as low cost options, which allow open access and learner control. Simulation lacks fidelity and remote laboratories are considered too complex for novice learners. A web-based combined laboratory format incorporates the benefits of each format while mitigating the shortcomings. Relatively few studies have examined the cognitive benefits of web-based laboratory formats in meeting computing education students’ goals. A web-based combined laboratory model that incorporates motivation strategies was developed to address non-traditional computing education students’ preferences for control of pace and access to learning. Internal validation of the laboratory model was conducted using pilot studies and Delphi expert review techniques. A panel of instructors from diverse computing education backgrounds reviewed the laboratory model. Panel recommendations guided enhancement of the model design.;1701628829;;;Dissertations & Theses;;Green, Michael;;;" Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.";;; Dissertation/Thesis;;; 2015; 978-1-321-93594-3;;; English; English;;;;2015;ProQuest Dissertations and Theses;;2015;;;;https://search.proquest.com/docview/1701628829?accountid=11774;; 0516 Adult education , 0710 Educational technology; 0516 Adult education , 0710 Educational technology;; 0516 Adult education , 0710 Educational technology;;; 0516 Adult education , 0710 Educational technology; Adult education , Educational technology; Education , Arcs motivation , Computer based learning , Delphi expert review , Experiential learning , Non-traditional student , Web-based laboratory;;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:Education+Database&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Motivation+and+Learning+of+Non-Traditional+Computing+Education+Students+in+a+Web-Based+Combined+Laboratory&amp;issn=&amp;date=2015-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Green%2C+Michael&amp;isbn=978-1-321-93594-3&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/";ProQuest Central,Social Science Premium Collection
Using TSPi and PBL to support software engineering education in an upper-level undergraduate course;"In recent years, software engineering education has rapidly changed to incorporate more realistic ways of learning. More frequently the software industry requires more skilled and qualified staff; however at the university level students are young, inexperienced, and relatively homogeneous in background and abilities. This article describes an approach that integrates a student teamwork methodology (TSPi) and project-based learning (PBL) to improve software project managerial skills in undergraduate students. As complementary support, a computational tool, the Teamwork Platform for Software Engineering Education, has been developed to establish an interactive software engineering course with local software industry collaboration. Experimental results show that a set of software metrics was defined to demonstrate performance improvement of 45 students following our approach. copyright 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Teaching Tip Enhancing Student Engagement: A Group Case Study Approach;  Computing professionals work in groups and collaborate with individuals having diverse backgrounds and behaviors. The Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology (ABET) characterizes that a computing program must enable students to attain the ability to analyze a problem, design and evaluate a solution, and work effectively on teams to accomplish a common goal. It is important for instructors to enable students to experience team work and collaboration while preparing them for their professional careers. Case-study analysis is an important method for engaging students in active collaborative learning. Forming groups and using case-study analysis is an effective way to integrate theoretical knowledge and real-world professional practices into the curriculum. This paper describes an innovative pedagogical and practical approach for integrating group case-study learning in a course. Our findings suggest that students were effectively able to share diverse perspectives and apply conceptual material to real-world situations in case-study learning activities.;1686798260;;;Scholarly Journals;;Taneja, Aakash;;; Copyright EDSIG Fall 2014;;; Feature;;; Fall 2014;;1055-3096;3; English; English;; 181-187; West Lafayette;Fall 2014;Journal of Information Systems Education;;2014;;;25;https://search.proquest.com/docview/1686798260?accountid=11774;;;; Tables , References;;; 181;; Case studies , Information systems , Teaching methods , Education , Teachers , Core curriculum , Brainstorming , Participation , Cooperative learning , Collaboration , Teamwork , Pedagogy , Educational technology , Active learning , Classrooms;;;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aabiglobal&amp;atitle=Teaching+Tip+Enhancing+Student+Engagement%3A+A+Group+Case+Study+Approach&amp;title=Journal+of+Information+Systems+Education&amp;issn=10553096&amp;date=2014-10-01&amp;volume=25&amp;issue=3&amp;spage=181&amp;au=Taneja%2C+Aakash&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=Journal+of+Information+Systems+Education&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/";ProQuest Central,SciTech Premium Collection,Social Science Premium Collection
Effects of the Meetings-Flow Approach on Quality Teamwork in the Training of Software Capstone Projects;"Software development relies heavily on teamwork; determining how to streamline this collaborative development is an essential training subject in computer and software engineering education. A team process known as the meetings-flow (MF) approach has recently been introduced in software capstone projects in engineering programs at various institutions. In undergraduate science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) curricula that emphasize team- and project-based learning, the MF approach serves as a macro-level instructional tool to guide students in holistically designing and directing collaborative project development. Previous studies on MF have shown the technical benefits of monitoring student work and product quality. This study investigated the approach further, from the perspective of team management. The effects of MF were examined through an experiment with team-related hypotheses. The results revealed that MF significantly enhances a team's communication and coordination and balances members' contributions by giving mutual support and effort. It has relatively less influence, however, on student team cohesion.";1969012197; EJ1156548;;Scholarly Journals;;"Chen, Chung-Yang;Hong, Ya-Chun;Chen, Pei-Chi";;;;;; Article , Report , 080: Journal Articles , 143: Reports - Research;;; Aug 2014;;0018-9359;3; English; English;; 201-208;;Aug 2014;IEEE Transactions on Education; Scholarly Journals , Reports;2014; http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/RecentIssue.jsp?punumber=13; ERIC, © Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers;57;https://search.proquest.com/docview/1969012197?accountid=11774;;;;;;; 201;;  2070ER5  2059 ,  2526ER5  2515 ,  10282ER5 9179ER5 126ER5  10240 9146 126 ,  10685ER5 4527ER5 912ER5  10642 4511 909 ,  2065ER5 5172ER5 8290ER5 3164ER5  2054 5155 8260 3150 ,  11139ER5 1815ER5 10321ER5 8043ER5 4558ER5  11095 1806 10278 8016 4542 ,  124ER5 5901ER5  124 5882 ,  4124ER5 4350ER5  4109 4335 ,  10125ER5 2586ER5 3643ER5 6603ER5  10087 2574 3629 6582 ,  8548ER5 8868ER5  8517 8836 ,  1811ER5 1815ER5 10321ER5 8043ER5 4558ER5  1802 1806 10278 8016 4542 ,  6533ER5  6512 ,  4532ER5 5365ER5 8800ER5  4516 5348 8768 ,  8330ER5  8299 ,  10148ER5 3164ER5  10110 3150 , Taiwan; Higher Education , Taiwan;;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aeric&amp;atitle=Effects+of+the+Meetings-Flow+Approach+on+Quality+Teamwork+in+the+Training+of+Software+Capstone+Projects&amp;title=IEEE+Transactions+on+Education&amp;issn=00189359&amp;date=2014-08-01&amp;volume=57&amp;issue=3&amp;spage=201&amp;au=Chen%2C+Chung-Yang%3BHong%2C+Ya-Chun%3BChen%2C+Pei-Chi&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=IEEE+Transactions+on+Education&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/EJ1156548&amp;rft_id=info:doi/";Social Science Premium Collection

Building an Undergraduate STEM Team Using Team-Based Learning Leading to the Production of a Storyboard Appropriate for Elementary Students;"A unique undergraduate team that spans five different engineering disciplines, chemistry, biology, and mathematics was formed. The team was formed to promote cross-disciplinary learning, to improve retention, and to prepare the students for the kind of problems they will face in their careers. This paper describes the variety of activities used over 2&#xa0;years to tie the team together, as well as afford opportunities to develop team-building skills. The activities described highlight the critical elements of a faculty leader whose own work is interdisciplinary, correct balance of disciplines in the team, and sufficient time for team development. The use of external feedback was essential for all activities. Clearly defined goals and hard deadlines were critical for the completion of individual activities, as well as developing a healthy team environment. Although the student cohort has learned from the activities, more time is needed to assess whether the students have become a fully efficient team. Furthermore, an additional cohort would be needed to assess whether the approach was able to assist with student’s interest in STEM and their desire to help other people.";2259587454;;;Scholarly Journals; Department of Civil Engineering, The University of Akron, Akron, OH, USA , Department of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering, The University of Akron, Akron, OH, USA , Integrated Biosciences Program, Department of Biology, The University of Akron, Akron, OH, USA;"Cutright, Teresa J;Evans, Edward;Brantner, Justin S";;; Journal of Science Education and Technology is a copyright of Springer, (2013).

Convergence of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) Tools in Project Based Learning (PBL);  Rapid technological advancement influences the communication and information management as well as knowledge construction. Within the context of new challenges, lifelong learning emerges a fundamental element for the constant development of professionals. So that it dynamically adapts to change and retain a state-of-the-art identity. At present, Computer Science Education, Information and Communication Technology (ICT) are becoming one of the most important elements which are defining the basic competencies of students. Information technology integrates medial, informative and computer science education, but also all the educational subjects mentioned in the curriculum basis of general education. In Science education, there is an increasing concept of integrated teaching, which shows the students, the world in a holistic manner. The principle of universal activity of students in cognitive, emotional and motivation, as well as in practical sphere is preferred. More and more often attention is paid to the fact that the contemporary problem is not so much lack of information, as its surplus and crowd of information as well as its unnecessary excess of details may be an effective tool of disinformation. Hence it forms such skills with students as selection, evaluation and organizing of information and forming its structure seems to be justified. So that, they can serve the drawing conclusion. In this article, the author has briefly outlined and taking into account the various manners of didactic transformation of teaching contents. Selected ICT tools have been presented in the light of teaching principles and cognitive activities model.;1558098340;;;Scholarly Journals;;Ismail Thamarasseri;;; Copyright iManager Publications Jun-Aug 2014;;; Feature;;; Jun-Aug 2014;;0973-2217;1; English; English;; 1-7; Nagercoil;Jun-Aug 2014;i-Manager's Journal on School Educational Technology;;2014;;;10;https://search.proquest.com/docview/1558098340?accountid=11774;;;; References;;; 1;; Educational technology , Science education , Cognitive style; Project Based Learning (PBL) , Information and Communication Technology (ICT) , Convergence;;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aindianjournals&amp;atitle=Convergence+of+Information+and+Communication+Technology+%28ICT%29+Tools+in+Project+Based+Learning+%28PBL%29&amp;title=i-Manager%27s+Journal+on+School+Educational+Technology&amp;issn=09732217&amp;date=2014-06-01&amp;volume=10&amp;issue=1&amp;spage=1&amp;au=Ismail+Thamarasseri&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=i-Manager%27s+Journal+on+School+Educational+Technology&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/";ProQuest Central
Improving teamwork in students software projects;The software industry and the academia have recognized the importance of teamwork as a driver to succeed in software projects. Therefore, the industry expects that new engineers are able to work in teams. Unfortunately, teamwork is a skill that cannot be transferred in a simple way, and there is not a clear recipe for doing that. This paper proposes the use of particular ThinkLets (a process pattern to address collaboration recurrent problems) to help overcome particular problems that jeopardize teamwork.

The impacts of personal characteristic on educational effectiveness in controlled-project based learning on software intensive systems development;"  Conference Title: 2014 IEEE 27th Conference on Software Engineering Education and Training - (CSEE&amp;T) Conference Start Date: 2014, April 23 Conference End Date: 2014, April 25 Conference Location: Klagenfurt, Austria In practical courses on software-intensive business systems, students work in teams to acquire practical skills in systems acquisition and provisioning. However, we do not yet have an established method to determine the optimal team composition to achieve maximum educational effectiveness. In this study, we quantitatively and qualitatively investigate how personal characteristics and the learning process of team members affect educational effectiveness by examining a university course in which students work in teams on a realistic project in a classroom setting. We use the Five Factors and Stress (FFS) theory and the modified grounded theory approach (M-GTA) to measure the personal characteristics and to identify the learning process of each team member. Additionally, we compare the learning process of a team with a high educational effectiveness to one with a low educational effectiveness based on number of topics about the learning process and the kind of topics. As a result, we find that it is better for a team to have members with different personal characteristic as defined by FFS theory in order for the students to acquire more knowledge and skills through the course. Additionally, teams that focus on fewer learning process topics acquire more knowledge and skills. We expect that our findings will help increase the educational effectiveness in similar practical courses.

Evaluation of Students’ Skills in Software Project;Software project probably is a sector that has witnessed the highest rate of project failure in the world. The industry claims that the software engineering graduates are not able to meet their requirements in software industry. This is surprising to the academia that offers software engineering specialization. This type of situation is creating the barrier between the software industry and academics and the efforts are made to reduce the gap. So it is important identify weaknesses of projects. This paper outlines evaluating questionnaire about the student projects in software development courses student projects. The questions were intended to test students’ soft skills and hard skills. This questionnaires performed Software Engineering, System Analysis and Design, and Agile Software Development courses in the Department of Computer Engineering. All of these courses are project based learning. In this study, soft skills and hard skills in software development courses students project evaluated. The purpose of this study identify the students project weaknesses in project based courses to provide better quality education in software development courses, preparing students for professional life, improvement of the success rate of software projects and possibly lead to reduce gap between academy and industry.;1955979411;;;Scholarly Journals;;"Pinar Cihan;Kalipsiz, Oya";;; Copyright UIKTEN - Association for Information Communication Technology Education and Science Feb 2014;;; Journal Article;;; Feb 2014;;2217-8309;1; English; English;; 42-49; Novi Pazar;Feb 2014;TEM Journal;;2014;;;3;https://search.proquest.com/docview/1955979411?accountid=11774;;;;;;; 42;; Students , Systems analysis , Software engineering , Design engineering , Engineering education , Software engineering , Graduates , Software development , Skills , Students , Software industry; Software engineering education , Software engineering industry , Quality assurance in education , Soft skills , hard skills;;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Ahightechjournals&amp;atitle=Evaluation+of+Students%26rsquo%3B+Skills+in+Software+Project&amp;title=TEM+Journal&amp;issn=22178309&amp;date=2014-02-01&amp;volume=3&amp;issue=1&amp;spage=42&amp;au=Pinar+Cihan%3BKalipsiz%2C+Oya&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=TEM+Journal&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/";ProQuest Central,SciTech Premium Collection
Electronic Learning Industrial Environment System (eLINS) for Academia-Industry Collaboration;  The gaps identified were partly transformed into prototyping which provided prove of the concept. The proven concept used the requirements gathered to create the functionality for the electronic Learning Industrial eNvironment System (eLINS). The purpose of eLINS is to be the tool that accommodates the Requirements Engineering Project-Based Learning (RE PjBL). This paper will begin with the discussion of functionality which emerged as use cases. The class diagram will have all of the requirements/stories that accumulated from the Literature Review and the interpretation from those requirements that had an input on use case identification. All the inputs had an overview on the eLIN system that acted as a medium that allowed Industry practitioners to share their experiences in doing their projects (case studies), students to upload the deliverables (SRS), and lecturers to be able to monitor student tasks. Future work will be focusing on the result and analysis of eLINS usability.;1466173538;;;Conference Papers & Proceedings;;"Jamaludin, Nor Azliana Akmal;Sahibuddin, Shamsul";;; Copyright IACSIT Press Feb 2014;; 10.7763/LNSE.2014.V2.97; Conference Proceedings;;; Feb 2014;;2301-3559;1; English; English;;; Singapore;Feb 2014;Lecture Notes on Software Engineering;;2014;;;2;https://search.proquest.com/docview/1466173538?accountid=11774;;;;;;; 71;;; Tools , requirement engineering , project-based Learning , eLearning , academia-industry collaboration , functionality , interface;;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=proceeding&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Acomputerinfo&amp;atitle=Electronic+Learning+Industrial+Environment+System+%28eLINS%29+for+Academia-Industry+Collaboration&amp;title=Lecture+Notes+on+Software+Engineering&amp;issn=23013559&amp;date=2014-02-01&amp;volume=2&amp;issue=1&amp;spage=71&amp;au=Jamaludin%2C+Nor+Azliana+Akmal%3BSahibuddin%2C+Shamsul&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=Lecture+Notes+on+Software+Engineering&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/10.7763%2FLNSE.2014.V2.97";SciTech Premium Collection
Rewards and Penalties: A Gamification Approach for Increasing Attendance and Engagement in an Undergraduate Computing Module;This paper describes how a gamified rewards and penalties framework was used to increase attendance and engagement in a level six undergraduate computing module teaching game production. The framework was applied to the same module over two consecutive years: a control year and a trial year. In both years the tutor, assignments and assessment strategies were the same and daily attendance was recorded. In the module, students work in multi-disciplinary teams to complete an assignment to build a computer game prototype. Unequal contribution to team projects by other students is a frequently voiced complaint to lecturers setting team assignments: a problem which is only partially solved by peer assessments, which are a retrospective analysis. The gamification framework provides a method for the lecturer to quickly identify disengaging students and to re-motivate them. Partnership between student and teacher, both parties must present themselves in order for that exchange of knowledge to take place. If unequal team contribution is a constant problem for students, then empty lecture halls can be considered similarly difficult for educators. This paper addresses three key points: 1) Does the rewards/penalties framework improve attendance? 2) If yes, does improved attendance result in improved assessments? 3) Does the framework improve engagement and performance in student teams? This paper presents quantitative evidence to answer the first two and offers speculative comments on the third. Initial results suggest that the rewards and penalties framework improves attendance and increases student performance and overall grade. Speculatively, the framework appears to be effective in increasing motivation. Informal student commentary indicates that while motivation is not improved across the cohort, those that are motivated contribute significantly more time and effort to the project. Rewards proved successful in improving completion of previously resisted tasks and in attracting students to attend classes they would otherwise miss.;1871585532; EJ1111206;;Scholarly Journals;;"Caton, Hope;Greenhill, Darrel";;;;; 10.4018/ijgbl.2014070101; Article , Report , 080: Journal Articles , 143: Reports - Research;;; 2014;;2155-6849;3; English; English;; 1-12;;2014;International Journal of Game-Based Learning; Scholarly Journals , Reports;2014; http://www.igi-global.com/journals; ERIC, © IGI Global;4;https://search.proquest.com/docview/1871585532?accountid=11774;;;;;;; 1;;  11139ER5 1815ER5 10321ER5 8043ER5 4558ER5  11095 1806 10278 8016 4542 ,  2065ER5 5172ER5 8290ER5 3164ER5  2054 5155 8260 3150 ,  5917ER5 5275ER5 3238ER5  5898 5258 3224 ,  717ER5  715 ,  5899ER5  5880 ,  2046ER5 4285ER5 126ER5  2035 4270 126 ,  9011ER5 8794ER5  8978 8762 ,  8521ER5 8794ER5  8490 8762 ,  5385ER5 6603ER5  5368 6582 ,  2236ER5 5901ER5  2225 5882 ,  677ER5 5259ER5  675 5242 ,  10236ER5 5275ER5 3238ER5  10194 5258 3224 ,  10685ER5 4527ER5 912ER5  10642 4511 909 ,  10664ER5 3241ER5 6603ER5  10621 3227 6582 ,  5265ER5  5248 ,  28ER5 96ER5  28 96 ,  98ER5 5016ER5  98 4999 ,  4459ER5  4444 ,  10256ER5 5016ER5  10214 4999 ,  10268ER5 6852ER5  10226 6827; Higher Education , Postsecondary Education;;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aeric&amp;atitle=Rewards+and+Penalties%3A+A+Gamification+Approach+for+Increasing+Attendance+and+Engagement+in+an+Undergraduate+Computing+Module&amp;title=International+Journal+of+Game-Based+Learning&amp;issn=21556849&amp;date=2014-01-01&amp;volume=4&amp;issue=3&amp;spage=1&amp;au=Caton%2C+Hope%3BGreenhill%2C+Darrel&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=International+Journal+of+Game-Based+Learning&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/EJ1111206&amp;rft_id=info:doi/10.4018%2Fijgbl.2014070101";Social Science Premium Collection
Females in Software Engineering Teams: A Social Sensitivity Perspective;"  Software Development is a complex and timedemanding task which requires a group of individuals working effectively as a team for long durations of times. Achieving effectiveness in productivity and quality of work is a challenging task that needs investment and commitment. A recent study conducted at MIT established that teams with greater social sensitivity (SS) tend to perform better when completing a variety of specific collaborative tasks. SS is an empathic ability to correctly understand feelings and perspective of others, and is clearly measureable. However their study was based only on set of generic tasks carried for a short period of time which required only hours to finish. Software development projects require teams to work collaboratively for much longer durations and more complicated tasks. Our goal is to determine if previous research that validated that adding more women to the team improves the team's social intelligence, which was not focused on students or professionals in scientific or technical fields, is germane for people in computing disciplines. This paper reports the results that investigate the presence of females in the teams, and how the ""female factor"" effects the average team social sensitivity, team performance activities and the satisfaction achieved during the tenure of team projects.";1649692452;;;Conference Papers & Proceedings;;"Khosla, Sourabh;Bender, Lisa L;Walia, Gursimran S;Nygard, Kendall";;; Copyright The Steering Committee of The World Congress in Computer Science, Computer Engineering and Applied Computing (WorldComp) 2014;;; Feature;;; 2014;;;; English; English;; 1-7; Athens;2014;Proceedings of the International Conference on Software Engineering Research and Practice (SERP);;2014;;;;https://search.proquest.com/docview/1649692452?accountid=11774;;;;;;; 1;;;;;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Ahightechjournals&amp;atitle=Females+in+Software+Engineering+Teams%3A+A+Social+Sensitivity+Perspective&amp;title=Proceedings+of+the+International+Conference+on+Software+Engineering+Research+and+Practice+%28SERP%29&amp;issn=&amp;date=2014-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=1&amp;au=Khosla%2C+Sourabh%3BBender%2C+Lisa+L%3BWalia%2C+Gursimran+S%3BNygard%2C+Kendall&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=Proceedings+of+the+International+Conference+on+Software+Engineering+Research+and+Practice+%28SERP%29&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/";ProQuest Central,SciTech Premium Collection
A Framework of Preparing Minority Students in Computer Science for the Industrial Career;"  The lack of preparedness of Computer Science graduates for a professional career is a common complaint raised by industry practitioners. The career progression of many new graduates is severely impacted due to the lack of problem solving capabilities and well rounded skills. For example, some of the technically stronger graduates lack communication and managerial skills and vise versa. Industry based capstone projects, incorporated as a part of an undergraduate degree, are a well accepted means of preparing students for their professional careers. This paper using a curriculum design of object oriented implementation class of graduate students at the Alabama A&amp;M University with engaging in industry based projects at the first year of their degree to illustrate how to increase student motivation, improve software development capability, increase problem-solving capability and speed up the skills and knowledge of engineering discipline. The project developed in the curriculum aims at providing students a real-world software engineering development experience, improving student programming skills and project management capability and object oriented design concepts, and preparing them for industry. At the end of semester, we observed a successful achievement of these projects in giving aspects of evaluation. We believe this achievement is due to the practice on the object oriented programming language and project design framework. Finally, we believe this approach can be extended to any other objective problem solving framework, focusing on managerial, engineering and science classes.";1648968029;;;Conference Papers & Proceedings;;Fu, Yujian;;; Copyright The Steering Committee of The World Congress in Computer Science, Computer Engineering and Applied Computing (WorldComp) 2014;;; Feature;;; 2014;;;; English; English;; 1-7; Athens;2014;Proceedings of the International Conference on Frontiers in Education: Computer Science and Computer Engineering (FECS);;2014;;;;https://search.proquest.com/docview/1648968029?accountid=11774;;;;;;; 1;;;;;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Ahightechjournals&amp;atitle=A+Framework+of+Preparing+Minority+Students+in+Computer+Science+for+the+Industrial+Career&amp;title=Proceedings+of+the+International+Conference+on+Frontiers+in+Education%3A+Computer+Science+and+Computer+Engineering+%28FECS%29&amp;issn=&amp;date=2014-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=1&amp;au=Fu%2C+Yujian&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=Proceedings+of+the+International+Conference+on+Frontiers+in+Education%3A+Computer+Science+and+Computer+Engineering+%28FECS%29&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/";ProQuest Central,SciTech Premium Collection
Improving motivation and engagement in core engineering courses with student teams;Team-based projects are common in capstone engineering design courses and increasingly common in first-year engineering programs. Despite high enrollments and budget cutbacks affecting many programs, second- and third-year students can also benefit from team-based project experiences, which motivate them to succeed in engineering and prepare them for a globally competitive workforce. My dissertation research demonstrates that team design projects can be incorporated into the curricula of engineering departments, and these projects result in positive affective outcomes for students. Using ABET outcomes and Self Determination Theory (SDT) as the background for my studies, I investigated students' confidence, motivation, and sense of community after experiencing team design projects in two different engineering departments at a large public institution. In the first study, I used a sequential mixed methods approach with a primary quantitative phase followed by an explanatory qualitative phase to evaluate a chemical engineering program that integrated team design projects throughout the curriculum. The evaluation methods included a survey based on desired ABET outcomes for students and focus groups to expand on the quantitative results. Students reported increased confidence in their design, teamwork, and communication skills after completing the projects. In my second and third studies, I used qualitative interviews based on SDT to explore student motivation in an electrical and computer engineering course redesigned to support students' intrinsic motivation to learn. SDT states that intrinsic motivation to learn is supported by increasing students' sense of autonomy, competence, and relatedness in regard to their learning. Using both narrative inquiry and phenomenological methodologies, I analyzed data from interviews of students for mentions of autonomy, competence, and relatedness as well as course events that were critical in changing students' motivation. Analysis revealed that individual choice, constructive failures, and a strong sense of community in the classroom were critical to moving students toward intrinsic motivation. Further, community building through team experiences characterized the essence of the student experience in the course. My research highlights a need for better quantitative measures of students' affective outcomes, specifically motivation, in the context of a single course. Based on the results of my studies, SDT should be reevaluated in terms of possible interdependencies between autonomy, competence, and relatedness, and how the social context of large engineering courses may create a deeper need for supporting relatedness.;1639029464;;;Dissertations & Theses;;Trenshaw, Kathryn Faye;;;" Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.";;; Dissertation/Thesis;;; 2014; 978-1-321-36659-4;;; English; English;;;;2014;ProQuest Dissertations and Theses;;2014;;;;https://search.proquest.com/docview/1639029464?accountid=11774;; 0537 Engineering , 0714 Science education , 0745 Higher education; 0537 Engineering , 0714 Science education , 0745 Higher education;; 0537 Engineering , 0714 Science education , 0745 Higher education;;; 0537 Engineering , 0714 Science education , 0745 Higher education; Engineering , Science education , Higher education; Applied sciences , Education , Engineering education , Intrinsic motivation , Relatedness , Self determination theory , Team-based learning;;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:Matericals+Science+%26+Engineering+Dissertations&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Improving+motivation+and+engagement+in+core+engineering+courses+with+student+teams&amp;issn=&amp;date=2014-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Trenshaw%2C+Kathryn+Faye&amp;isbn=978-1-321-36659-4&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/";SciTech Premium Collection
Peer Evaluation and Assessment Resource (PEAR) to Assess Students' Professional Skills;  Professional skills expected from science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) students are well-aligned with the broad learning outcomes defined by the Accreditation Board of Engineering and Technology (ABET). While acquisition of professional skills in our graduates is increasingly crucial due to global competition and intensifying pressures on companies, the absence of a robust assessment framework limits effectiveness of pedagogical efforts by faculty. Thus, there is a need for an assessment model, which can help assess students' professional skill development across multiple disciplines. In this paper, we introduce a web-based application, called Peer Evaluation and Assessment Resource (PEAR), to assist in assessing students' development in professional skills, and we illustrate how this tool can be used for teamwork assessment. PEAR intends to streamline the processes of peer evaluations. PEAR has been designed based on the theory of Model of Domain Learning (MDL), and thus can help explain the complex interactions among knowledge, interest level, and strategies with which knowledge is gained. We illustrate the workflow of PEAR and how MDL is integrated into the peer assessment process. We also discuss the advantages of the MDL-based assessment framework compared to a traditional assessment model.;1622299082;;;Scholarly Journals;;"Kulturel-Konak, Sadan;Konak, Abdullah;Kremer, Gül E Okudan;Esparragoza, Ivan;Yoder, Gareth";;; Copyright Institute of Industrial Engineers-Publisher 2014;;; Feature;;; 2014;;;; English; English;; 746-753; Norcross;2014;IIE Annual Conference.

Software Requirement Engineering Risk Prediction Model;  Analysis of many software program assignments from 2011 through 2014 shows interesting patterns. When you compare large assignments that have efficiently attained their own cost as well as schedule quotes versus the ones that ran delayed, ended up over spending budget, or maybe ended up, half a dozen popular difficulties ended up noticed: weak requirement analysis and management, weak cost calculating, weak handling of requirement change requests, weak milestone monitoring as well as requirement gold plating habit. By comparison, prosperous local software program assignments tended to be much better than on-site software development and management. Maybe the most interesting part of most of these many problem areas can be like everyone is coordinating project management instead of using technical focus. Author focused over the impact of software requirement change requests and requirement gold plating while dealing with on-site project assignments. Author also evaluated new algorithmic model to avoid global software engineering requirement failure, which in turn curtails the estimated time and budget with client satisfaction.;1617412394;;;Scholarly Journals;;"Patil, Shruti;Ade, Roshani";;; Copyright Foundation of Computer Science 2014;; 10.5120/17784-8545; Journal Article;;; 2014;;0975-8887;2; English; English;;; New York;2014;International Journal of Computer Applications;;2014;;;102;https://search.proquest.com/docview/1617412394?accountid=11774;;;;;;; n/a;;;;;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Acomputerinfo&amp;atitle=Software+Requirement+Engineering+Risk+Prediction+Model&amp;title=International+Journal+of+Computer+Applications&amp;issn=09758887&amp;date=2014-01-01&amp;volume=102&amp;issue=2&amp;spage=&amp;au=Patil%2C+Shruti%3BAde%2C+Roshani&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=International+Journal+of+Computer+Applications&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/10.5120%2F17784-8545";SciTech Premium Collection
Design and Implementation of a Capstone Course to Satisfy the Industry Needs of Virtual Product Development and ABET Engineering Criteria;  Over the past two decades, computer aided engineering (CAE) processes and procedures became an integral part of the product development cycle. Virtual product development (VPD) refers to procedures that integrate the CAE tools in a unified approach that spans all the product development phases. Current industrial trends utilize VPD tools and procedures to reduce the product development time without jeopardizing the product quality. These trends led to an increasing demand for engineers with computer skills, multidisciplinary engineering knowledge, and acquaintance with VPD tools. ABET program outcomes emphasize providing courses with an accumulated background of curricular components to solve realistic open-ended engineering problems. Capstone design project (CDP) course has been regarded as important learning activity that could be designed to provide senior engineering student an opportunity to solve such problems. A major objective of the CDP course is to simulate industrial setting and allow students to experience real-life engineering practice. This paper presents an implementation of the VPD procedures in a mechanical engineering CDP course. This integration simulates the industrial environment through multidisciplinary teams working together in subsystems to produce one product using standard commercial VPD tools. This course implementation is demonstrated using a case study of teams working to design and build a solar car.;1547917799;;;Scholarly Journals;;Omar, Mohamed A;;; Copyright © 2014 Mohamed A. Omar.

The effect of group dynamics on high-school students' creativity and problem-solving strategies with investigative open-ended non-routine problems;"Creativity is at the heart of mathematics, yet many students have little opportunity to experience creativity within mathematics classrooms. By creating and structuring problems in ways designed to develop flexible mathematical thinking, students can experience mathematical creativity (Dreyfus &amp; Eisenburg, 1996). The aim of this study was to determine the extent to which, for high-school students, individual versus group activities have an impact on the creativity on the problem-solving strategies when solving investigative open-ended non-routine mathematics questions. Answers from individual students and groups were compared and contrasted by evaluating the creative process and classifying the strategies and resources employed. The study was qualitative in nature, using the data-gathering technique of guided questioning. Participants included twenty-nine Grade 10 students from a public high school in the Greater Toronto Area in Canada. Students who either had taken or were currently taking academic Grade 10 mathematics were recruited to participate. Students worked on an investigative open-ended non-routine mathematics question in groups or individually. Answers from individual students and groups were compared and contrasted by evaluating the creative process and classifying the strategies employed by mathematical problem-solving specialists. Ten individual responses and six group responses were examined. Student responses to the investigative open-ended non-routine problems suggest that there is little difference between group and individual problem-solving approaches and strategies. Almost all of the study participants approached the investigative open-ended non-routine problems by researching information and creating an algebraic formula. The data also suggest students' level of creativity was greater when working in a group, compared to when working alone. Lastly, individuals and groups tended to use the same number and types of resources. When students were allowed to work with an investigative open-ended non-routine problem, they were able to ""do"" mathematics on their own, rather than having it done for them. To that end, students need to interact with problems that force them to critically analyze situations, make unguided mathematical decisions, and work with unfamiliar situations.";1545892156;;;Dissertations & Theses;;Nahornick, Ashley;;;" Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.";;; Dissertation/Thesis;;; 2014; 978-1-303-93177-2;;; English; English;;;;2014;ProQuest Dissertations and Theses;;2014;;;;https://search.proquest.com/docview/1545892156?accountid=11774;; 0280 Mathematics education , 0525 Educational psychology; 0280 Mathematics education , 0525 Educational psychology;; 0280 Mathematics education , 0525 Educational psychology;;; 0280 Mathematics education , 0525 Educational psychology; Mathematics education , Educational psychology; Education , Collaboration , Creativity , Group work , High schools , Non-routine problems , Problem solving;;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:Education+Database&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+effect+of+group+dynamics+on+high-school+students%27+creativity+and+problem-solving+strategies+with+investigative+open-ended+non-routine+problems&amp;issn=&amp;date=2014-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Nahornick%2C+Ashley&amp;isbn=978-1-303-93177-2&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/";ProQuest Central,Social Science Premium Collection
Team Effectiveness Theory from Industrial and Organizational Psychology Applied to Engineering Student Project Teams: A Research Review;  Engineering student team projects are frequently used to meet professional learning outcomes. Industrial and organizational psychologists study teams in the industry settings for which we prepare students, yet this research does not effectively inform engineering education. This research review sought to demonstrate the relevance of literature on teams literature from industrial and organizational psychology to engineering education and to identify implications for practice and future directions for research. Phase 1 systematically reviewed 104 articles published from 2007 to 2012 describing engineering and computer science student team projects and sought to answer the following questions: What professional learning outcomes have been met by team projects? What negative student team behaviors have faculty sought to minimize? What literature has been used to inform development of teamwork outcomes? Phase 2 reviewed five team effectiveness constructs selected according to the results of Phase 1: social loafing, interdependence, conflict, trust, and shared mental models. Examples from Phase 1 articles and our own work explain how this research informs facilitation and assessment of engineering student teams. Engineering faculty sought to achieve a variety of outcomes through team projects, including teamwork, communication, sustainability, and consideration of global/societal design context. They sought to avoid social loafing and conflict while building trust to ensure equal team effort. That few Phase 1 articles engaged the literature about team effectiveness indicates there is great opportunity to apply industrial and organizational psychology research to engineering education.;1636192733;;;Scholarly Journals;;"Borrego, Maura;Karlin, Jennifer;McNair, Lisa D;Beddoes, Kacey"; JEEDEQ;; Copyright Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

IS Learning: The Impact of Gender and Team Emotional Intelligence;  In university settings, dysfunction in teamwork often challenges problem-based learning in IS projects. Researchers of IS Education have largely overlooked Team Emotional Intelligence (TEI), which offers a collective cognitive skill that may benefit the student learning experience. Hypothesized are four dimensions of emotional intelligence (EI) that influence perceived effectiveness in IS learning teams. This paper proposes a model that explains how these four dimensions influence perceived team effectiveness and how gender affects this relationship. A survey administered to 384 students resulting in 94 IS learning teams produced regression (and moderated regression) results showing that gender, along with two TEI dimensions (awareness and management of one's own emotion) predict team effectiveness. Significant results suggest gender differences in the relationship between a team member's awareness of his or her own emotions, management of others' emotions, and team effectiveness. These findings suggest IS educators should focus on targeted interventions that may help to foster the development of emotionally intelligent IS learning teams. Most prominently, gender plays an important role for emotional intelligence competencies, where differences exist in awareness of one's own emotions and management of others' emotions among student learning teams.

Teaching Tip A Memory Game to Demonstrate the Power of Collaborative Efforts to Improve Team Performance;  Collaboration is an important aspect of information systems (IS) education since work is typically performed in teams. However, IS students often do not fully appreciate the value of group work in their business courses. This teaching tip describes an activity that will objectively demonstrate the value of collaboration and diversity of perspectives, while simultaneously satisfying the preferences of visual and experiential learning styles. Knowledge gained through collaborative and cooperative learning tends to be retained for an extended period of time. The author includes discussion prompts to help guide students as they identify the value of diverse perspectives in team settings, but instructors are encouraged to follow the interests of their students and allow rich discussion to emerge naturally.

Communications Management in Scrum Projects;"  The last decade is characterized, in many IT companies, by changing the system development life cycle methodology from the classical waterfall or prototype methods to the agile methodology of development. The agile methodology, developed in the beginning of 2000's, encourages the development of working software within a defined framework, while accepting changes and keeping the customer involved during the whole project. The present paper examines the relationship between the project management-customer's communication and the project success. The agile software development methodology was introduced in February 2001, when the Agile Manifesto was conceived, based on four values: (1) Individuals and interactions over processes and tools; (2) Working software over comprehensive documentation; (3) Customer collaboration over contract negotiation; and (4) Responding to change over following a plan. The scrum model for developing software applies the agile values and methodology while presenting a framework, terminology, roles and ceremonies to perform successful projects. The core roles include the development team, the scrum master, and the product owner who represents the customer and the users. Effective communication with the various stakeholders in a scrum project, aimed to develop a new product or software, is essential. The scrum method defines a series of sprints, of two to four weeks, in which the team performs the tasks to be completed. The current paper presents a quantitative research, where 61 managers and customers of IT scrum projects, answered a reliable questionnaire. The study investigated the perceived success of agile projects as measured by meeting schedule, budget and performance requirements, as well as customer satisfaction and long term achievements such as business objectives and development of core competencies. Findings reveal that effective communication is a dominant factor in a success scrum project. Furthermore, the communications with the customer was characterized by the following items: face-to-face conversations, telephone and email correspondences, and accepting changes following conversations with the customer. Analysis of the virtual communication tools effectiveness shows that although the project team members are satisfied with the use of these communication media tools, the tools are usually not evaluated on an economical basis but rather based on a convenience of use. The study highlights the importance of communications management in IT project management as applied these days. Professionals and project managers should be aware to the impact of effective communications on the project success and to be able to identify the weak areas in their arena of communications.";1679860594;;;Conference Papers & Proceedings;;"Holzmann, Vered;Panizel, Ilanit";;; Copyright Academic Conferences International Limited Sep 2013;;; Feature;;; Sep 2013;;;; English; English;; 67-74; Reading;Sep 2013;The European Conference on Information Systems Management;;2013;;;;https://search.proquest.com/docview/1679860594?accountid=11774;;;;;;; 67;; Software , Project management , Product development , Research , Product life cycle , Information technology , Communication , Interpersonal communication , Media richness , Success factors , Customer satisfaction;;;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Ahightechjournals&amp;atitle=Communications+Management+in+Scrum+Projects&amp;title=The+European+Conference+on+Information+Systems+Management&amp;issn=&amp;date=2013-09-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=67&amp;au=Holzmann%2C+Vered%3BPanizel%2C+Ilanit&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=The+European+Conference+on+Information+Systems+Management&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/";ProQuest Central,SciTech Premium Collection

Improving Teaching Methodology in System Analysis and Design using Problem Based Learning for ABET;  System Analysis and Design is an active field that demonstrates continuously new techniques and approaches to develop systems more effectively and efficiently. Teaching System Analysis and Design courses are thus quite challenging for many reasons, such as rapid changes in the environment, changes in the nature of technology, demands and needs of the industry and new market trends. These factors will have a direct effect on the students learning and their effectiveness in the place of work. This paper examines this trend and considers Problem Based Learning as the best methodology to respond to them. It will improve the students understanding of the concepts, ideas and thus enhance their learning experience. This paper also examines the level of achievements in the course learning outcomes as outlined by Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology.;1627736304;;;Scholarly Journals;;"Fatima, Sara;Salha Abdullah";;; Copyright Modern Education and Computer Science Press Sep 2013;; 10.5815/ijmecs.2013.07.07; Journal Article;;; Sep 2013;;2075-0161;7; English; English;; 60-68; Hong Kong;Sep 2013;International Journal of Modern Education and Computer Science;;2013;;;5;https://search.proquest.com/docview/1627736304?accountid=11774;;;;;;; 60;;; System Analysis , Design , Problem based learning , ABET , ACM , KSO , CLO , PEO;;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aeducation&amp;atitle=Improving+Teaching+Methodology+in+System+Analysis+and+Design+using+Problem+Based+Learning+for+ABET&amp;title=International+Journal+of+Modern+Education+and+Computer+Science&amp;issn=20750161&amp;date=2013-09-01&amp;volume=5&amp;issue=7&amp;spage=60&amp;au=Fatima%2C+Sara%3BSalha+Abdullah&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=International+Journal+of+Modern+Education+and+Computer+Science&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/10.5815%2Fijmecs.2013.07.07";ProQuest Central,SciTech Premium Collection,Social Science Premium Collection
A sampled literature review of design-based learning approaches: a search for key characteristics;  Design-based learning (DBL) is an educational approach grounded in the processes of inquiry and reasoning towards generating innovative artifacts, systems and solutions. The approach is well characterized in the context of learning natural sciences in secondary education. Less is known, however, of its characteristics in the context of higher engineering education. The purpose of this review study is to identify key characteristics of DBL in higher engineering education. From the tenets of engineering design practices and higher engineering education contexts we identified four relevant dimensions for organizing these characteristics: the project characteristics, the role of the teacher, the assessment methods, and the social context. Drawing on these four dimensions, we systematically reviewed the state-of-the-art empirical literature on DBL or DBL-like educational projects in higher engineering education. Based on this review we conclude that DBL projects consist of open-ended, hands-on, authentic and multidisciplinary design tasks resembling the community of engineering professionals. Teachers facilitate both the process of gaining domain-specific knowledge and the thinking activities relevant to propose innovative solutions. Teachers scaffold students in the development from novice to expert engineers. Assessment is characterized by formative and summative of both individual and team products and processes and by the use of a variety of assessment instruments. Finally, the social context of DBL projects includes peer-to-peer collaboration in which students work in teams. The implications of these findings for further research on DBL in higher engineering education are discussed.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT];1434119166;;;Scholarly Journals;;"Gómez Puente, Sonia M;van Eijck, Michiel;Jochems, Wim";;; Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht 2013;; 10.1007/s10798-012-9212-x; Feature;;; Aug 2013;;0957-7572;3; English; English;; 717-732; Dordrecht;Aug 2013;International Journal of Technology and Design Education;;2013;;;23;https://search.proquest.com/docview/1434119166?accountid=11774;;;;;;; 717;;;;;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aeducation&amp;atitle=A+sampled+literature+review+of+design-based+learning+approaches%3A+a+search+for+key+characteristics&amp;title=International+Journal+of+Technology+and+Design+Education&amp;issn=09577572&amp;date=2013-08-01&amp;volume=23&amp;issue=3&amp;spage=717&amp;au=G%C3%B3mez+Puente%2C+Sonia+M%3Bvan+Eijck%2C+Michiel%3BJochems%2C+Wim&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=International+Journal+of+Technology+and+Design+Education&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/10.1007%2Fs10798-012-9212-x";Art, Design & Architecture Collection,ProQuest Central,SciTech Premium Collection,Social Science Premium Collection
The evolution of agile software development in Brazil: Education, research, and the state-of-the-practice;  Agile software development methods have been increasingly adopted worldwide and became one of the mainstream software development approaches. Agile methods have also had an impact on software engineering education with universities adapting their courses to accommodate this new form of software development. Software engineering research has tried to evaluate the impact of agile methods in industrial projects and discover in which situations it is beneficial to apply such methods. However, there are almost no studies focusing on the progress of the agile movement in Brazil. In this paper, we present an overview of the evolution of the agile movement in Brazil, outlining the history of its first advocates in academia and industry.

Improving Financial Planning Graduate Employability Through Enterprise Education;  Financial planning requires students to display tacit learning. However, the traditional teaching approach concentrates on theory development independent of any applied connection with the profession. This paper uses an adaptation of the Goetz et al. (2005) model to demonstrate how curricula can provide a smoother progression into the financial planning profession. Further, a number of teaching strategies are described to provide a closer connection with the profession.

Teaching Agile Software Engineering Using Problem-Based Learning;Many studies have reported the utilization of Problem-Based Learning (PBL) in teaching Software Engineering courses. However, these studies have different views of the effectiveness of PBL. This paper presents the design of an Advanced Software Engineering course for undergraduate Software Engineering students that uses PBL to teach them Agile software development methods- particularly Scrum. The course also aims to develop entrepreneurial skills needed for software engineering graduates to better prepare them for the software industry. The assessment process designed for this course is illustrated. The paper shows that Scrum practices correlate with the characteristics of the PBL approach, which has resulted in a successful experience of PBL as reported by students in an end of a semester survey.;2013524054; EJ1168356;;Scholarly Journals;;El-Khalili, Nuha H.;;;;; 10.4018/jicte.2013070101; Article , Report , 080: Journal Articles , 143: Reports - Research;;; 2013;;1550-1876;1; English; English;; 1-12;;2013;International Journal of Information and Communication Technology Education; Scholarly Journals , Reports;2013; https://www.igi-global.com/journals/; ERIC, © IGI Global;9;https://search.proquest.com/docview/2013524054?accountid=11774;;;;;;; 1;;  8257ER5 5901ER5  8227 5882 ,  10664ER5 3241ER5 6603ER5  10621 3227 6582 ,  2070ER5  2059 ,  11139ER5 1815ER5 10321ER5 8043ER5 4558ER5  11095 1806 10278 8016 4542 ,  5611ER5 9726ER5 1ER5  5592 9690 1 ,  8330ER5  8299 ,  10303ER5 10423ER5 3643ER5 6603ER5  10260 10380 3629 6582 ,  4124ER5 4350ER5  4109 4335 ,  2065ER5 5172ER5 8290ER5 3164ER5  2054 5155 8260 3150 ,  2353ER5 3640ER5  2342 3626 ,  10219ER5 732ER5  10181 730 ,  10685ER5 4527ER5 912ER5  10642 4511 909 ,  8263ER5 1719ER5  8233 1710 ,  9721ER5 5070ER5 2799ER5  9685 5053 2787 , Jordan; Higher Education , Jordan;;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aeric&amp;atitle=Teaching+Agile+Software+Engineering+Using+Problem-Based+Learning&amp;title=International+Journal+of+Information+and+Communication+Technology+Education&amp;issn=15501876&amp;date=2013-01-01&amp;volume=9&amp;issue=1&amp;spage=1&amp;au=El-Khalili%2C+Nuha+H.&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=International+Journal+of+Information+and+Communication+Technology+Education&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/EJ1168356&amp;rft_id=info:doi/10.4018%2Fjicte.2013070101";Social Science Premium Collection
Pedagogical design for knowledge creating inquiry in customer projects;Two higher education courses involving students, teachers, and customers in multifaceted experiences of knowledge creation are described. The Trialogical Learning Approach (TLA) provides a theoretical framework to address learning and teaching organized around authentic problems and the development of shared knowledge objects, such as reports, products, and new practices. The approach directs attention to those aspects of social interaction and artifact-mediated activities, which focus on the development of shared objects and the pursuit of novel knowledge and understanding. The roles of technology-mediation, customer involvement, and guidance in developing effective pedagogical practices for knowledge creation were addressed. It appears necessary to design sufficient open-endedness and complexity for students’ teamwork to generate unpredictable, practical, and epistemologically challenging situations. Pedagogical design for such a process has different foci in the four central phases planning, project initiation, project execution, and presentation and evaluation. Planning and initiation are central to establishing relevance and project awareness for the collaboration of student teams with a customer. Guidance and expert modeling during project initiation and execution is needed to overcome feelings of uncertainty during a challenging and complex assignment. Mediation provided by collaboration tools facilitates reflection on collective practices, iterative development of knowledge objects, and documentation of the learning outcomes of customer projects.;1955098386;;;Scholarly Journals;;"Hanni Muukkonen;Kosonen, Kari;Marttiin, Pentti;Vesikivi, Petri;Kaistinen, Jyrki;Nyman, Göte";;;" (c) 2013 Hanni Muukkonen, Kari Kosonen, Pentti Marttiin, Petri Vesikivi, Jyrki Kaistinen, Göte Nyman.

A Holistic Framework for the Development of an Educational Game Aiming to Teach Computer Programming;  Computer science is gradually changing, evolving and adapting according to the needs of each time period by incorporating the technological developments available. However, despite the occurring changes and the current progress in the domain, computer programming is still a vital chapter within computer science, and its teaching remains a difficult endeavour. On the other hand, students have changed the way with which they learn, interact with and search for knowledge. They spend significant amounts of their everyday lives from a very young age interacting with the computers by playing games. Thus, they are used to environments with impressive special effects and graphical interfaces where they have full control of the situation and interact with the environment's elements. Therefore, today's teachers are trying to connect computer programming learning with students' everyday usage of the computer, which does not include simple textual editors for programming lines of code with no other interaction functionalities. Hence, teachers face the challenge of incorporating environments that are similar to students' existing mentality and of creating tasks and assignments that can be executed within these environments and can provide students with the necessary programming knowledge and skills. A number of software solutions were developed towards facing the aforementioned difficulties. They can be classified into three main categories, namely educational programming environments, microworlds and educational games. Educational games used in computer programming courses are considered to present added value, due to their ability to motivate students towards actively participating in the learning process and to support high levels of interaction, group work and critical thinking. Thus, we have developed an educational game that aims to further enhance computer programming education by addressing occurring problems. This paper aims to introduce and elaborate on a holistic framework that has been constructed as a guide towards the development of this game. To this end, we collect documented difficulties identified in computer programming learning and teaching and study existing frameworks that have been proposed for the development of software solutions for computer programming courses and for the development of successful serious games that do not however focus on computer programming education. This information is thoroughly studied and refined and results in the proposed framework that could also be employed for the design and development of other future educational games focusing on computer programming education.;1549957131;;;Conference Papers & Proceedings;;"Malliarakis, Christos;Satratzemi, Maya;Xinogalos, Stelios";;; Copyright Academic Conferences International Limited 2013;;; Feature;;; 2013;;2049-0992;; English; English;; 359-368; Reading;2013;European Conference on Games Based Learning;;2013;;;;https://search.proquest.com/docview/1549957131?accountid=11774;;;;;;; 359;; Computer programming , Design , Education , Teaching , Learning , Motivation , Computer & video games;;;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Ahightechjournals&amp;atitle=A+Holistic+Framework+for+the+Development+of+an+Educational+Game+Aiming+to+Teach+Computer+Programming&amp;title=European+Conference+on+Games+Based+Learning&amp;issn=20490992&amp;date=2013-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=359&amp;au=Malliarakis%2C+Christos%3BSatratzemi%2C+Maya%3BXinogalos%2C+Stelios&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=European+Conference+on+Games+Based+Learning&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/";ProQuest Central,SciTech Premium Collection
USING A MULTIDISICPLINARY RESEARCH PROJECT TO STRENGTHEN LEARNING IN SOFTWARE ENGINEERING;  It is our premise that a single experience, even in an in-depth project based course, is not adequate for students to transfer all required software engineering knowledge and skills to other situations. The project we described allows us to instill an engineering attitude in the curriculum and the academic computing environment. Through flexibility and responsiveness to change, this approach prepares students to adapt to rapid change in the field by teaching enduring principles in the context of current practice. Exposing computer science students to the convergence of multiple disciplines strengthens a student's ability to manipulate and automate different levels of abstraction simultaneously and develop new conceptual frameworks to address current and future challenges in hardware and software engineering.

Teams using Real World Projects in a Software Engineering Course;  For a Computer Science undergraduate degree program, the topics in software engineering are among the core topics recommended by the joint task force in computing curricula 2005. There is a large area of literature supporting the concept of project-based learning in a team setting to enhance teaching in a software engineering course. This paper discusses the curriculum issues within a software engineering course and explores and analyzes some advantages/disadvantages of using a team based approach with a real world project. Using data collected through a software engineering course at Southern Utah University, the author examines the overall experience in having a real software project from a local company using the PBL (Problem Base Learning) style in a team setting.;1491419531;;;Conference Papers & Proceedings;;Tadayon, Nasser;;; Copyright The Steering Committee of The World Congress in Computer Science, Computer Engineering and Applied Computing (WorldComp) 2013;;; Feature;;; 2013;;;; English; English;; 1-7; Athens;2013;Proceedings of the International Conference on Software Engineering Research and Practice (SERP);;2013;;;;https://search.proquest.com/docview/1491419531?accountid=11774;;;;;;; 1;;;;;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Ahightechjournals&amp;atitle=Teams+using+Real+World+Projects+in+a+Software+Engineering+Course&amp;title=Proceedings+of+the+International+Conference+on+Software+Engineering+Research+and+Practice+%28SERP%29&amp;issn=&amp;date=2013-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=1&amp;au=Tadayon%2C+Nasser&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=Proceedings+of+the+International+Conference+on+Software+Engineering+Research+and+Practice+%28SERP%29&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/";ProQuest Central,SciTech Premium Collection
Agile Project-Based Teaching and Learning;  Agile courses in university settings aim to prepare students to face the ever increasing demands from the software industry, where Agile has become mainstream. This proves the importance of teaching and understanding Agile. This is why Agile is no longer just a part of the software engineering curriculum in Computer Science but a standalone course in most cases, though with increasing challenges for both faculty and students. This article presents yet another example case of the design, planning, development and evaluation of an agile project-based course. The reason for addressing the Agile teaching is twofold: not only the Agile theory and practice taught and experienced in class, but also the teaching itself, and consequently the learning, has been adapted to changing requirements and priorities in each course edition. Making it project-based allows students to work with realistic projects through which they learn Agile more effectively, in collaborative and self-organizing teams. These insights, as well as settings and experiences over a total of 4 years, are addressed in this article.;1491419526;;;Conference Papers & Proceedings;;Monett, Dagmar;;; Copyright The Steering Committee of The World Congress in Computer Science, Computer Engineering and Applied Computing (WorldComp) 2013;;; Feature;;; 2013;;;; English; English;; 1-7; Athens;2013;Proceedings of the International Conference on Software Engineering Research and Practice (SERP);;2013;;;;https://search.proquest.com/docview/1491419526?accountid=11774;;;;;;; 1;;;;;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Ahightechjournals&amp;atitle=Agile+Project-Based+Teaching+and+Learning&amp;title=Proceedings+of+the+International+Conference+on+Software+Engineering+Research+and+Practice+%28SERP%29&amp;issn=&amp;date=2013-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=1&amp;au=Monett%2C+Dagmar&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=Proceedings+of+the+International+Conference+on+Software+Engineering+Research+and+Practice+%28SERP%29&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/";ProQuest Central,SciTech Premium Collection
Is information technology education betters learned in teams? An exploratory study of teamwork effectiveness at a higher education institution;The purpose of this research was to determine if the effectiveness of technology education can be significantly increased through use of team-based activities including both real-time team encounters and results-driven team assignments. The research addresses this purpose by examining perceptions regarding effectiveness of team-based learning in several degree programs in Information Technology education. Survey data was gathered from adult students about their experience with recent team assignments. All participants were enrolled at a large private non-profile university on the west coast within the School of Engineering, Technology and Media. The Team Work Survey was administered and hosted on the Survey Monkey website and released to about 200 courses in programs for a Bachelor of Science or a Master of Science degree. Over four periods, survey responses were returned for 96 learners enrolled in undergraduate courses and 126 learners enrolled in graduate courses. The researcher was granted permission by DiFonzo (2010) to use a survey instrument adapted and piloted that was based on an earlier Team Performance Survey originated by Peters (1997) who developed, validated and determined its reliability. Several comparisons were made using statistical analysis to determine the interesting patterns relevant to this research. The interpretation of findings included evidence that team effectiveness was indeed positively aligned with team members' perceptions about ability to learn, with their interest in the topic and the motivation of individual members to commit time and energy to the team assignments.;1472058801;;;Dissertations & Theses;;Lauridsen, Barbara L.;;;" Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.";;; Dissertation/Thesis;;; 2013; 978-1-303-53728-8;;; English; English;;;;2013;ProQuest Dissertations and Theses;;2013;;;;https://search.proquest.com/docview/1472058801?accountid=11774;; 0489 Information Technology , 0727 Curriculum development , 0745 Higher education; 0489 Information Technology , 0727 Curriculum development , 0745 Higher education;; 0489 Information Technology , 0727 Curriculum development , 0745 Higher education;;; 0489 Information Technology , 0727 Curriculum development , 0745 Higher education; Information Technology , Curriculum development , Higher education; Applied sciences , Education , Ability to learn , Collective efficacy , Interest in the topic , Motivation , Team effectiveness , Team work survey;;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:Publicly+Available+Content+Database&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Is+information+technology+education+betters+learned+in+teams%3F+An+exploratory+study+of+teamwork+effectiveness+at+a+higher+education+institution&amp;issn=&amp;date=2013-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Lauridsen%2C+Barbara+L.&amp;isbn=978-1-303-53728-8&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/";ProQuest Central
SBL-online: Implementing studio-based learning techniques in an online introductory programming course to address common programming errors and misconceptions;"Much research has been done in regards to student programming errors, online education and studio-based learning (SBL) in computer science education. This study furthers this area by bringing together this knowledge and applying it to proactively help students overcome impasses caused by common student programming errors. This project proposes a pedagogy for proactive online teaching. Studio-Based Learning Online (SBL-Online) consists of three components, the SBL pedagogy, the strategic timing and content of the SBL sessions and the online nature of the implementation environment. The implementation of SBL-Online aims to provide a better quality of online computer programming courses promoting student-student interaction focused on the discussion of problematic curriculum issues. Data collected prior to the application of SBL-Online provided counts of common student programming errors. This information was used to create the assignments that were later used during the SBL-Online sessions. In regards to its implementation, this project is two-fold; on the one hand it compares online vs. SBL incarnations of the same course. On the other hand it observes and analyzes what goes on during the SBL-Online sessions. The data collection includes an end-of-semester questionnaire, a modified version of the motivated strategies for learning questionnaire (MSLQ), as well as thick data collection extracted from the course management system, student emails and SBL-Online session video recordings. Recordings’ analyses of student interaction during SBL sessions play a very important role within this study. The SBL-Online just as its face-to-face counterpart SBL, has shown the potential to help novice programmers overcome the limitations unique to introduction to programming courses. In most cases there is evidence on students’ optimistic state of mind before, during and after SBL sessions highlighting the effects of this treatment. On the other hand there is evidence of renouncing and defeatist thoughts from the control group. This research provides a unique insight into the inner workings and effects of SBL, including the identification of “learning moments,” student-student interaction and the building of camaraderie. SBL-Online impacted student’s behavior, in different areas of the course, such as, attitude towards peers and attitude towards the course.";1428351224;;;Dissertations & Theses;;Polo, Blanca J.;;;" Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.";;; Dissertation/Thesis;;; 2013; 978-1-303-31429-2;;; English; English;;;;2013;ProQuest Dissertations and Theses;;2013;;;;https://search.proquest.com/docview/1428351224?accountid=11774;; 0710 Educational technology , 0747 Vocational education; 0710 Educational technology , 0747 Vocational education;; 0710 Educational technology , 0747 Vocational education;;; 0710 Educational technology , 0747 Vocational education; Educational technology , Vocational education; Education , Computer science education , Distance education , Introductory programming , Online , Studio-based learning;;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:Education+Database&amp;atitle=&amp;title=SBL-online%3A+Implementing+studio-based+learning+techniques+in+an+online+introductory+programming+course+to+address+common+programming+errors+and+misconceptions&amp;issn=&amp;date=2013-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Polo%2C+Blanca+J.&amp;isbn=978-1-303-31429-2&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/";ProQuest Central,Social Science Premium Collection
Using Online Project-Based Capstone Experiences to Enhance Soft Skills Development;"Employers of newly minted information technology graduates are concerned that students graduating with information technology degrees offered in online environments are lacking critical noncomputing skills (soft skills). Further, it is unclear whether online environments have the capacity to foster the ""soft skills"" necessary for graduates to be successful in actual work environments. On-ground universities have tried multiple solutions including integrating soft skills into lower division courses—both technical courses and general education courses. On-ground universities have also suggested incorporating performance-based capstone experiences into technical degree programs. While much research has been done in evaluating the value of capstone experiences in face-to-face environments, research investigating the potential of such an experience to enhance and demonstrate soft skills resulting from the engagement in an online environment is lacking. The purpose of this study was to examine the value of a project-based capstone experience in promoting and assessing the enhancement of soft skills in an online undergraduate information technology degree program. The main goals of this research were to discover whether online competency based programs and the culminating project-based capstone promoted enhancement and demonstration of critical soft skills necessary to succeed in information technology work environments. Results of the study were based on analysis of interviews, curriculum and literature reviews, and extant survey data. A standout outcome of the study includes a new Gains' in Soft Skills Scalelet based on National Survey of Student Engagement (NSSE) survey questions to measure gains in soft skill competence. Several conclusions can be drawn from this study. First, critical soft skills are taught and demonstrated as a result of engagement with the online competency-based undergraduate information program. Second, it appears that some soft skills are more strongly emphasized than others thereby implying that the online learning model may be well suited to teaching and demonstrating some soft skills and not others. Finally, the culminating project-based capstone experience appears to be missing two key requirements: team participation and oral presentations.";1415918382;;;Dissertations & Theses;;Britton, Gwendolyn Suzanne;;;" Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.";;; Dissertation/Thesis;;; 2013; 978-1-303-17054-6;;; English; English;;;;2013;ProQuest Dissertations and Theses;;2013;;;;https://search.proquest.com/docview/1415918382?accountid=11774;; 0710 Educational technology; 0710 Educational technology;; 0710 Educational technology;;; 0710 Educational technology; Educational technology; Education , Capstone , Distance learning , Information technology , National Survey of Student Engagement (NSSE) , Online , Soft skills;;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:Education+Database&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Using+Online+Project-Based+Capstone+Experiences+to+Enhance+Soft+Skills+Development&amp;issn=&amp;date=2013-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Britton%2C+Gwendolyn+Suzanne&amp;isbn=978-1-303-17054-6&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/";ProQuest Central,Social Science Premium Collection
A case study: Motivational attributes of 4-H participants engaged in robotics;Robotics has gained a great deal of popularity across the United States as a means to engage youth in science, technology, engineering, and math. Understanding what motivates youth and adults to participate in a robotics project is critical to understanding how to engage others. By developing a robotics program built on a proper understanding of the motivational influences, the program can be built on a foundation that addresses these influences. By engaging more youth in the robotics program, they will be able to envision a future for themselves as a high-school or college graduate, in addition to a viable employee with marketable skills in tough economy. The purpose of this research was to evaluate the underlying motivational attributes or factors that influenced 4-H youth, parents, volunteers, and agents to participate in the Mississippi 4-H robotics project. Specifically, this research focuses on two unique counties in Mississippi with very diverse populations. Interviews with participants, observation, and document analysis which took place occurred over the course of a robotics year - October to July. This study sought to identify motivational attributes of participants in the robotics project. Once identified these attributes could be used when developing new program curricula or expanding into new counties in Mississippi. Data analysis revealed that there are many unique motivational factors that influence participants. Among these factors, (1) the desire to build and construct a robot, (2) competition and recognition, (3) desire for future success and security, (4) safe place to participate and build relationships, (5) teamwork, (6) positive role models, and (7) encouragement.;1353098093;;;Dissertations & Theses;;Smith, Mariah Lea;;;" Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.";;; Dissertation/Thesis;;; 2013; 978-1-303-03816-7;;; English; English;;;;2013;ProQuest Dissertations and Theses;;2013;;;;https://search.proquest.com/docview/1353098093?accountid=11774;; 0710 Educational technology , 0771 Robotics; 0710 Educational technology , 0771 Robotics;; 0710 Educational technology , 0771 Robotics;;; 0710 Educational technology , 0771 Robotics; Educational technology , Robotics; Applied sciences , Education , 4-H clubs , Extrinsic motivation , Informal learning , Intrinsic motivation , Robotics;;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:Education+Database&amp;atitle=&amp;title=A+case+study%3A+Motivational+attributes+of+4-H+participants+engaged+in+robotics&amp;issn=&amp;date=2013-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Smith%2C+Mariah+Lea&amp;isbn=978-1-303-03816-7&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/";ProQuest Central,Social Science Premium Collection
Investigating team cohesion in COCOMO II.2000;Software engineering is team oriented and intensely complex, relying on human collaboration and creativity more than any other engineering discipline. Poor software estimation is a problem that within the United States costs over a billion dollars per year. Effective measurement of team cohesion is foundationally important to gain accurate estimations of software development schedules, quality and cost. In light of recent team cohesion research, COCOMO II.2000 (Constructive Cost Model), a well-known industry software estimation tool, appears to contain a less than effective method in determining team cohesion. The COCOMO II.2000 TEAM variable represents the team cohesion measure of all stakeholders involved in the software development product life cycle and is one of five special factor variables aggregated into an exponent that represents risk to product development. An ineffective or inaccurate measure of team cohesion creates an exponential error in the software estimation results generated by the COCOMO II.2000. Using the Delphi method, a panel consisting of team cohesion, project management, and emotional intelligence experts have determined the COCOMO II.2000 TEAM variable does not effectively represent team cohesion as defined in this research.;1314593212;;;Dissertations & Theses;;Snowdeal-Carden, Betty A.;;;" Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.";;; Dissertation/Thesis;;; 2013; 978-1-267-92850-4;;; English; English;;;;2013;ProQuest Dissertations and Theses;;2013;;;;https://search.proquest.com/docview/1314593212?accountid=11774;; 0384 Behavioral psychology , 0464 Computer Engineering , 0489 Information Technology; 0384 Behavioral psychology , 0464 Computer Engineering , 0489 Information Technology;; 0384 Behavioral psychology , 0464 Computer Engineering , 0489 Information Technology;;; 0384 Behavioral psychology , 0464 Computer Engineering , 0489 Information Technology; Behavioral psychology , Computer Engineering , Information Technology; Applied sciences , Psychology , Cocomo ii , Emotional intelligence , Software development , Software estimation , Task cohesion , Team cohesion;;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:Psychology+Database&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Investigating+team+cohesion+in+COCOMO+II.2000&amp;issn=&amp;date=2013-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Snowdeal-Carden%2C+Betty+A.&amp;isbn=978-1-267-92850-4&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/";ProQuest Central
Effective Teaching of SE Curriculum with the help of Real World Instructor;  Projects are failing more often than they are successful. After analyzing the courses behind, we found that many projects are missing their schedules, exceeding their budgets, delivering software products with poor quality and in many cases even poor functionality. Software development was misunderstood as only coding, whereas it is something before coding and continues even after deployment of software. In this paper we have mention the teaching methodologies to be made to SE education i. e, reducing the gap between research community and what is applied in industry. We have divided our paper mainly in two sections Course I: which will explain the concept of SE to be taught to students by faculty, Course II practical implementation of projects to be done by students under technical expert.;1288788437;;;Scholarly Journals;;"Aggarwal, Bharti;Tomer, Uma;Tarai, Sanjyoti";;; Copyright Foundation of Computer Science 2013;; 10.5120/10433-5111; Journal Article;;; 2013;;0975-8887;1; English; English;;; New York;2013;International Journal of Computer Applications;;2013;;;63;https://search.proquest.com/docview/1288788437?accountid=11774;;;;;;; n/a;;;;;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Acomputerinfo&amp;atitle=Effective+Teaching+of+SE+Curriculum+with+the+help+of+Real+World+Instructor&amp;title=International+Journal+of+Computer+Applications&amp;issn=09758887&amp;date=2013-01-01&amp;volume=63&amp;issue=1&amp;spage=&amp;au=Aggarwal%2C+Bharti%3BTomer%2C+Uma%3BTarai%2C+Sanjyoti&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=International+Journal+of+Computer+Applications&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/10.5120%2F10433-5111";SciTech Premium Collection
Adapting to Change in a Master Level Real-World-Projects Capstone Course;Our mission of capstone computing courses for the past ten years has been to offer students experience with the development of real-world information technology projects. This experience has included both the hard and soft skills required for the work they could expect as industrial practitioners. Hard skills entail extending one's knowledge structure with technical know-how, specifically using the latest software and hardware tools for building applications of genuine utility. Soft skills include the ability to work in a collaborative setting (e.g., to participate in team coordination and governance), the ability to interact with a customer (e.g., to establish product requirements and achieve acceptance), the ethos of creating value, and a facility for technical communications (written, oral, and electronic). Significant changes in the instructional environment have taken place in the ten years since the capstone class was first offered. This paper describes the adaptation to changes in the course's delivery so that its mission continues to be fulfilled successfully.;1895971816; EJ1136642;;Scholarly Journals;;"Tappert, Charles C.;Stix, Allen";;;;;; Article , Report , 080: Journal Articles , 141: Reports - Descriptive; 1545-679X;; Dec 2012;;;6; English; English;; 25-37;;Dec 2012;Information Systems Education Journal; Scholarly Journals , Reports;2012; http://isedj.org; ERIC, © Information Systems and Computing Academic Professionals;10;https://search.proquest.com/docview/1895971816?accountid=11774;;;;;;; 25;;  6400ER5 1802ER5 8362ER5  6379 1793 8331 ,  2065ER5 5172ER5 8290ER5 3164ER5  2054 5155 8260 3150 ,  10282ER5 9179ER5 126ER5  10240 9146 126 ,  2526ER5  2515 ,  4467ER5 1815ER5 10321ER5 8043ER5 4558ER5  4452 1806 10278 8016 4542 ,  3190ER5 1393ER5  3176 1387 ,  4525ER5 126ER5  4509 126 ,  10247ER5 3640ER5  10205 3626 ,  7356ER5 2085ER5 2084ER5 10719ER5 2362ER5 2526ER5  7330 2074 2073 10675 2351 2515 ,  10685ER5 4527ER5 912ER5  10642 4511 909 , New York; Higher Education , Postsecondary Education , New York;;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aeric&amp;atitle=Adapting+to+Change+in+a+Master+Level+Real-World-Projects+Capstone+Course&amp;title=Information+Systems+Education+Journal&amp;issn=1545-679X&amp;date=2012-12-01&amp;volume=10&amp;issue=6&amp;spage=25&amp;au=Tappert%2C+Charles+C.%3BStix%2C+Allen&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=Information+Systems+Education+Journal&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/EJ1136642&amp;rft_id=info:doi/";Social Science Premium Collection
Proceedings of the International Association for Development of the Information Society (IADIS) International Conference on Cognition and Exploratory Learning in Digital Age (CELDA) (Madrid, Spain, October 19-21, 2012);The IADIS CELDA 2012 Conference intention was to address the main issues concerned with evolving learning processes and supporting pedagogies and applications in the digital age. There had been advances in both cognitive psychology and computing that have affected the educational arena. The convergence of these two disciplines is increasing at a fast pace and affecting academia and professional practice in many ways. Paradigms such as just-in-time learning, constructivism, student-centered learning and collaborative approaches have emerged and are being supported by technological advancements such as simulations, virtual reality and multi-agents systems. These developments have created both opportunities and areas of serious concerns. This conference aimed to cover both technological as well as pedagogical issues related to these developments. The IADIS CELDA 2012 Conference received 98 submissions from more than 24 countries. Out of the papers submitted, 29 were accepted as full papers. In addition to the presentation of full papers, short papers and reflection papers, the conference also includes a keynote presentation from internationally distinguished researchers. Individual papers contain figures, tables, and references.;1373093007; ED542606;;Conference Papers & Proceedings;;;;;;;; Conference Proceeding , 021: Collected Works - Proceedings;;; Oct 2012;

Towards the Constructive Incorporation of Serious Games Within Object Oriented Programming;"  Object oriented programming (OOP) is a complex domain in the education field and requires proper technological underpinning for the facilitation of the process. However, the vast variety of available programming environments makes the selection of the most efficient technology that will cover students' needs and will lead to the teachers' desired learning outcomes a significant challenge. These technologies, such as Educational Programming Environments and Programming Microworlds, are often applied on OOP courses in order to underpin the process and help students develop internal incentives, thus foster the feeling of challenge, curiosity, active control and imagination. However, students of the 21st century are growing up in a fully digital world and therefore learn and react accordingly. Alongside the growth of the Internet, high speed access and virtual communities have contributed to a new trend development called online gaming. Therefore, computer games can be considered an appropriate means to deliver knowledge to students of most courses and increase their motivation to learn. A term that is often used when referring to computer games incorporated in the learning experience is ""serious games"", and they can involve one or multiple players. Serious games have a higher learning value when they are used in courses that consider critical thinking, group work and decision making as essential to be developed. Therefore, it is the paper's initial intent to examine representative examples of commonly used technologies in OOP education and to derive their most prominent features that support students' successful learning experience. To this end, we carry out a theoretical research of the literature regarding Educational Programming Environments and Programming Microworlds in OOP education, as well as serious games in OOP or in computer programming in general following a concept-centric methodological approach. These concepts consist of the most prominent functionalities supported by representative technologies in the three categories. This leads to the conclusion that even serious games can enable and foster the development of skills and personal characteristics through the underpinning of group collaboration towards the motivated fulfilment of given tasks within highly interactive environments that simulate worlds and situations.

You are my Clients: A Multi-Disciplinary Software Development Project;  Recently, there are many good examples of how multi-disciplinary learning can support students to learn collaboratively and not solely focus on a single professional sector. In past years, we have arranged students taking different subjects within the Department of Computing to work in groups for joint projects. One observation is the lack of application domain knowledge amongst many of the completed projects. There is a need to bring in business elements while not introducing much demand in resources. In Fall 2011, we have attempted to gather students studying different professional domains together. Three groups of students from the Department of Computing (COMP) and the School of Hotel and Tourism Management (SHTM) are involved. The first group of SHTM students is planning a conference event in 2012 with over 300 guests. These students act as the customers who require a banquet management system as well as a delegates managing application. The role of the second group of SHTM students is to manage the development projects with the support of IT consultants who are in fact the COMP students. During the semester, different communication channels have been set up to facilitate the inter-group and intra-group communications with the support offered by an e-learning system, Blackboard. In addition, there are classroom presentations given by the SHTM students and prototype demonstrations prepared by the COMP students. Pre-project and post-project questionnaires have been given to all participating students in order to assess their gain in professional and business knowledge in 2 different areas, namely database application development and conference management. In this paper, we would like to report our experience, problems and the difficulties encountered in this multi-disciplinary pilot project.

On integrating student empirical software engineering studies with research and teaching goals;  Background: Many empirical software engineering studies use students as subjects and are conducted as part of university courses. Aim: We aim at reporting our experiences with using guidelines for integrating empirical studies with our research and teaching goals. Method: We document our experience from conducting three studies with graduate students in two software architecture courses. Results: Our results show some problems that we faced when following the guidelines and deviations we made from the original guidelines. Conclusions: Based on our results we propose recommendations for empirical software engineering studies that are integrated in university courses.;1775159032;;;Conference Papers & Proceedings;;"Galster, M;Tofan, D;Avgeriou, P";;; Copyright The Institution of Engineering & Technology May 14, 2012;; 10.1049/ic.2012.0018; Journal Article;;; May 14, 2012; 978-1-84919-541-6;;; English; English;;; Stevenage;May 14, 2012;IET Conference Proceedings;;2012;;;;https://search.proquest.com/docview/1775159032?accountid=11774;; C6110B Software engineering techniques , C0220 Computing education and training; C6110B Software engineering techniques , C0220 Computing education and training;; C6110B Software engineering techniques , C0220 Computing education and training;; n/a; C6110B Software engineering techniques , C0220 Computing education and training;; educational courses , software architecture , teaching , student empirical software engineering , teaching goal , university course , software architecture course;;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:book&amp;genre=unknown&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Ahightechjournals&amp;atitle=&amp;title=On+integrating+student+empirical+software+engineering+studies+with+research+and+teaching+goals&amp;issn=&amp;date=2012-05-14&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Galster%2C+M%3BTofan%2C+D%3BAvgeriou%2C+P&amp;isbn=978-1-84919-541-6&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=On+integrating+student+empirical+software+engineering+studies+with+research+and+teaching+goals&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/10.1049%2Fic.2012.0018";ProQuest Central,SciTech Premium Collection
Rethinking of Computing Curricula in Higher Education in Pakistan;"  Developing &amp; implementing appropriate curricula is a paramount challenge in computing education. To meet this challenge, educators from all over the world are updating curriculum on a regular basis. Recently, the Higher Education Commission of Pakistan has revised the existing curricula of degree programs to standardize computing education in Pakistan. Taking a content analysis approach the study has pointed out many some shortcomings of the revised curricula. The study recommends that the teaching of over-crowded course contents must be discouraged as it promotes rote learning and inhibits creativity and innovation. Curriculum development processes must be followed to develop an effective curriculum. Also, the curriculum must enrich students' experiences, thoughts, beliefs, assumptions, and attitudes in their field of study to develop special characteristics and mindset. The recommendations made in this study may help the concerned authorities to take measures to improve the quality and standards of the computing curriculum in Pakistan.";1443724717;;;Scholarly Journals;;"Pasha, Muhammad Anwar-Ur-Rehman;Pasha, Shaheen";;; Copyright International Journal of Advanced Research in Computer Science May 2012;;; Journal Article;;; May 2012;;;3; English; English;;; Udaipur;May 2012;International Journal of Advanced Research in Computer Science;;2012;;;3;https://search.proquest.com/docview/1443724717?accountid=11774;;;;;;; n/a;;;;;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Ahightechjournals&amp;atitle=Rethinking+of+Computing+Curricula+in+Higher+Education+in+Pakistan&amp;title=International+Journal+of+Advanced+Research+in+Computer+Science&amp;issn=&amp;date=2012-05-01&amp;volume=3&amp;issue=3&amp;spage=&amp;au=Pasha%2C+Muhammad+Anwar-Ur-Rehman%3BPasha%2C+Shaheen&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=International+Journal+of+Advanced+Research+in+Computer+Science&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/";ProQuest Central,SciTech Premium Collection

From Gatekeeping to Engagement: A Multicontextual, Mixed Method Study of Student Academic Engagement in Introductory STEM Courses;  Issue Title: AIR Forum Issue The lack of academic engagement in introductory science courses is considered by some to be a primary reason why students switch out of science majors. This study employed a sequential, explanatory mixed methods approach to provide a richer understanding of the relationship between student engagement and introductory science instruction. Quantitative survey data were drawn from 2,873 students within 73 introductory science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) courses across 15 colleges and universities, and qualitative data were collected from 41 student focus groups at eight of these institutions. The findings indicate that students tended to be more engaged in courses where the instructor consistently signaled an openness to student questions and recognizes her/his role in helping students succeed. Likewise, students who reported feeling comfortable asking questions in class, seeking out tutoring, attending supplemental instruction sessions, and collaborating with other students in the course were also more likely to be engaged. Instructional implications for improving students' levels of academic engagement are discussed.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT];918773262;;;Scholarly Journals;;"Gasiewski, Josephine A;Eagan, M Kevin;Garcia, Gina A;Hurtado, Sylvia;Chang, Mitchell J";;; Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2012;; 10.1007/s11162-011-9247-y; Feature;;; Mar 2012;;0361-0365;2; English; English;; 229-261; New York;Mar 2012;Research in Higher Education;;2012;;;53;https://search.proquest.com/docview/918773262?accountid=11774;;;;;;; 229;; Academic achievement , Science education , College students , Learning;;;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aeducation&amp;atitle=From+Gatekeeping+to+Engagement%3A+A+Multicontextual%2C+Mixed+Method+Study+of+Student+Academic+Engagement+in+Introductory+STEM+Courses&amp;title=Research+in+Higher+Education&amp;issn=03610365&amp;date=2012-03-01&amp;volume=53&amp;issue=2&amp;spage=229&amp;au=Gasiewski%2C+Josephine+A%3BEagan%2C+M+Kevin%3BGarcia%2C+Gina+A%3BHurtado%2C+Sylvia%3BChang%2C+Mitchell+J&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=Research+in+Higher+Education&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/10.1007%2Fs11162-011-9247-y";ProQuest Central,Social Science Premium Collection
Rolling: A new technique for the practical teaching in computer science university degree;  In this paper we describe a new methodology for practical teaching in the Computer Science University Degree. The methodology is based on the Rolling technique. This technique consists in assign, in a rotary process, tasks, activities and responsibilities to students along an established calendar with the aim of developing a software product. Practical teaching is supported by a student-teacher contract that describes the goal, rules, plan with stages and activities, responsibilities and even the assessment method. Students are organized in groups and teams, emulating a company organization. They develop all the activities of the software engineering process in order to obtain a commercial product (the goal). In this process, students take different responsibilities over the software verification and validation, activities and tasks, and over groups and teams leadership. Along the teaching process, comprehensive information about the working team, time invested, deliverables in each stage, and work/students assessment is gathered. The methodology has been tested for 4 years at the University of Córdoba and the results, described in this paper, have shown an improvement in the students learning as well as in the acquisition of attitudes and skills mandatory for their professional development.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT];918484384;;;Scholarly Journals;;"Luque Ruiz, Irene;Gómez-nieto, Miguel Ángel";;; Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2012;; 10.1007/s10639-010-9144-6; Feature;;; Mar 2012;;1360-2357;1; English; English;; 49-77; New York;Mar 2012;Education and Information Technologies;;2012;;;17;https://search.proquest.com/docview/918484384?accountid=11774;;;;;;; 49;; Computer science , Colleges & universities , Teamwork;;;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aeducation&amp;atitle=Rolling%3A+A+new+technique+for+the+practical+teaching+in+computer+science+university+degree&amp;title=Education+and+Information+Technologies&amp;issn=13602357&amp;date=2012-03-01&amp;volume=17&amp;issue=1&amp;spage=49&amp;au=Luque+Ruiz%2C+Irene%3BG%C3%B3mez-nieto%2C+Miguel+%C3%81ngel&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=Education+and+Information+Technologies&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/10.1007%2Fs10639-010-9144-6";ProQuest Central,Social Science Premium Collection
Group formation based on learning styles: can it improve students' teamwork?;This work explores the impact of teacher-led heterogeneous group formation on students' teamwork, based on students' learning styles. Fifty senior university students participated in a project-based course with two key organizational features: first, a web system (PEGASUS) was developed to help students identify their learning styles and distribute them to heterogeneous groups. Second, group facilitation meetings were introduced as a technique to help students reflect on their weak/strong traits and employ appropriate roles in their group. The study research questions focused mainly on students' attitudes regarding the learning style-based group formation approach. By applying qualitative research method students' views were recorded about the impact of styles awareness and group heterogeneity on group collaboration and possible benefits and drawbacks related to the style-based grouping approach. Evaluation data revealed that students gradually overcame their initial reservations for the innovative group formation method and were highly benefited since styles heterogeneity within the group emphasized complementarities and pluralism in students' ways of thinking. Overall, this work provides evidence that the adoption of learning styles theories in practice can be facilitated by systems for automated group formation and supportive group facilitation meetings that help avoiding the trivial and discouraging approach of using learning styles to simply label students.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT];917881380;;;Scholarly Journals;;"Kyprianidou, Maria;Demetriadis, Stavros;Tsiatsos, Thrasyvoulos;Pombortsis, Andreas";;; Association for Educational Communications and Technology 2012;; 10.1007/s11423-011-9215-4; Feature;;; Feb 2012;;1042-1629;1; English; English;; 83-110; New York;Feb 2012;Educational Technology, Research and Development;;2012;;;60;https://search.proquest.com/docview/917881380?accountid=11774;;;;;;; 83;; Learning , Cognitive style , Students , Teamwork;;;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Apsychology&amp;atitle=Group+formation+based+on+learning+styles%3A+can+it+improve+students%27+teamwork%3F&amp;title=Educational+Technology%2C+Research+and+Development&amp;issn=10421629&amp;date=2012-02-01&amp;volume=60&amp;issue=1&amp;spage=83&amp;au=Kyprianidou%2C+Maria%3BDemetriadis%2C+Stavros%3BTsiatsos%2C+Thrasyvoulos%3BPombortsis%2C+Andreas&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=Educational+Technology%2C+Research+and+Development&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/10.1007%2Fs11423-011-9215-4";ProQuest Central,Social Science Premium Collection
Behind the Final Grade in Hybrid v. Traditional Courses: Comparing Student Performance by Assessment Type, Core Competency, and Course Objective;There are many different delivery methods used by institutions of higher education. These include traditional, hybrid, and online course offerings. The comparisons of these typically use final grade as the measure of student performance. This research study looks behind the final grade and compares student performance by assessment type, core competency, and course objective. The statistical conclusions showed that hybrid course delivery could produce similar if not better results than traditional delivery. In addition, students performed significantly higher in assignments, critical thinking, written communications, and the advanced course objectives. Surprisingly, there appeared to be little if any impact on group projects and teamwork skills in the hybrid sections. Therefore, this study supports the hybrid delivery method for courses with similar course components.;1895977859; EJ1136737;;Scholarly Journals;;Bain, Lisa Z.;;;;;; Article , Report , Undefined , 080: Journal Articles , 143: Reports - Research , 160: Tests/Questionnaires; 1545-679X;; Feb 2012;;;1; English; English;; 47-60;;Feb 2012;Information Systems Education Journal; Scholarly Journals , Reports , Other Sources;2012; http://isedj.org; ERIC, © Information Systems and Computing Academic Professionals;10;https://search.proquest.com/docview/1895977859?accountid=11774;;;;;;; 47;;  4459ER5  4444 ,  1063ER5 10664ER5 3241ER5 6603ER5  1060 10621 3227 6582 ,  2222ER5 10664ER5 3241ER5 6603ER5  2211 10621 3227 6582 ,  1966ER5 3643ER5 6603ER5  1955 3629 6582 ,  10247ER5 3640ER5  10205 3626 ,  1981ER5 1ER5  1970 1 ,  2355ER5 7256ER5  2344 7230 ,  2065ER5 5172ER5 8290ER5 3164ER5  2054 5155 8260 3150 ,  5184ER5  5167 ,  1815ER5 10321ER5 8043ER5 4558ER5  1806 10278 8016 4542 ,  677ER5 5259ER5  675 5242 ,  4525ER5 126ER5  4509 126 ,  10282ER5 9179ER5 126ER5  10240 9146 126 ,  10833ER5 6468ER5  10789 6447 ,  2443ER5 1719ER5  2432 1710 ,  11660ER5 6120ER5 5771ER5  11614 5752 6101 ,  10685ER5 4527ER5 912ER5  10642 4511 909; Higher Education , Postsecondary Education;;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aeric&amp;atitle=Behind+the+Final+Grade+in+Hybrid+v.+Traditional+Courses%3A+Comparing+Student+Performance+by+Assessment+Type%2C+Core+Competency%2C+and+Course+Objective&amp;title=Information+Systems+Education+Journal&amp;issn=1545-679X&amp;date=2012-02-01&amp;volume=10&amp;issue=1&amp;spage=47&amp;au=Bain%2C+Lisa+Z.&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=Information+Systems+Education+Journal&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/EJ1136737&amp;rft_id=info:doi/";Social Science Premium Collection
An Ill-Structured PBL-Based Microprocessor Course without Formal Laboratory;This paper introduces a problem-based learning (PBL) microprocessor application course designed according to the following strategies: 1) hands-on training without having a formal laboratory, and 2) intense student-centered cooperative learning through an ill-structured problem. PBL was adopted as the core educational technique of the course to accomplish student learning outcomes such as fundamental knowledge acquisition and applications, practical design experiences, problem-solving skills, higher-order thinking, teamwork and communication skills, and lifelong self-directed learning capability. In the designed course, students were required to build their own hardware system on a breadboard and learn how to program, download, and execute from a student mentor's demonstration. Students were also asked to choose a design topic for their team project with minimum guidelines and were encouraged to learn whatever was necessary to accomplish the project autonomously. The course has been offered for two years and has obtained overwhelming positive feedback from students.

Application Of Wikis With Scaffolding Structure In Laboratory Reporting;  This work demonstrates how a Wiki can be mapped into different learning stages during group- based lab reporting via an adequate scaffolding structure. The scaffolding structure of the Wiki- based group report is comprised of six constructs in sequence: Appendix, Methods, Results, Analysis, Introduction and Conclusion. The scaffolding structure was developed with the intention of integrating a cooperative learning element into the Wiki's collaborative learning platform. A case study based on a Mechanical Engineering Technology (MET) lab was presented in the study to describe in detail how the group lab report was developed with the Dashboard Wiki. The Wiki compiled data from 42 group reports and student feedback. Lab observations were collected to determine if the Wiki with scaffolding structure, as an instructional tool, had a positive impact on student learning.;1822120590;;;Scholarly Journals;;Ge, Changfeng;;; Copyright The Clute Institute 2012;; 10.19030/ajee.v3i2.7440; Journal Article;;; 2012;;2153-2516;2; English; English;; 89-104; Littleton;2012;American Journal of Engineering Education;;2012;;;3;https://search.proquest.com/docview/1822120590?accountid=11774;;;;;;; 89;;; Wikis , Scaffolding Structure , Student Learning , Laboratory Reporting;;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aengineeringjournals&amp;atitle=Application+Of+Wikis+With+Scaffolding+Structure+In+Laboratory+Reporting&amp;title=American+Journal+of+Engineering+Education&amp;issn=21532516&amp;date=2012-01-01&amp;volume=3&amp;issue=2&amp;spage=89&amp;au=Ge%2C+Changfeng&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=American+Journal+of+Engineering+Education&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/10.19030%2Fajee.v3i2.7440";ProQuest Central,SciTech Premium Collection

Strategies for Teaching Ideation and Ethics in Computer Science;  Although social, ethical, and professional standards have been included in some undergraduate computer science departments' curricula, many faculty members who teach computer science ethics classes continue to look for fresh approaches in teaching ethics and social implications courses. Traditionally, this type of course has focused on viewing computer technologies through an ethical lens. The global use of computer technologies continues to develop and rapidly change. The IEEE/ACM Computer Science Curriculum 2013 has acknowledged this shift. Students in computer science and information technology need to develop a mature appreciation for the societal impacts of the technologies that they likely will have a part in creating and maintaining. This paper discusses a successful course in ethics and social implications that will help students develop their ethical reasoning skills and an appreciation for the complex impact that technologies have on the society.;1413258338;;;Conference Papers & Proceedings;;"Nygard, Kendall E;Bender, Lisa;Walia, Gursimran;Brooks, Kevin;Kambhampaty, Krishna;Nygard, Travis E";;; Copyright The Steering Committee of The World Congress in Computer Science, Computer Engineering and Applied Computing (WorldComp) 2012;;; Feature;;; 2012;;;; English; English;; 1-7; Athens;2012;Proceedings of the International Conference on Frontiers in Education: Computer Science and Computer Engineering (FECS);;2012;;;;https://search.proquest.com/docview/1413258338?accountid=11774;;;;;;; 1;;;;;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Ahightechjournals&amp;atitle=Strategies+for+Teaching+Ideation+and+Ethics+in+Computer+Science&amp;title=Proceedings+of+the+International+Conference+on+Frontiers+in+Education%3A+Computer+Science+and+Computer+Engineering+%28FECS%29&amp;issn=&amp;date=2012-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=1&amp;au=Nygard%2C+Kendall+E%3BBender%2C+Lisa%3BWalia%2C+Gursimran%3BBrooks%2C+Kevin%3BKambhampaty%2C+Krishna%3BNygard%2C+Travis+E&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=Proceedings+of+the+International+Conference+on+Frontiers+in+Education%3A+Computer+Science+and+Computer+Engineering+%28FECS%29&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/";ProQuest Central,SciTech Premium Collection
AnalyzeD: A Shared Tool for Analyzing Virtual Team Collaboration in Classroom Software Engineering Projects;  Classroom software engineering projects are viable aids for the education of computer science students. They allow to experience different technologies, methods, and development processes first hand, and intensify the learning effect compared to traditional lectures. But how to track whether the learning goals of such projects are fulfilled? Main focus in project evaluation often resides on results, since tracking the process itself can only be achieved with substantial manual efforts. We present AnalyzeD, a tool that simplifies monitoring of development processes within such settings. It enables observation of groupware systems for the occurrence of behavior that reflects defined learning goals like adherence to principles of the taught development processes or effective and efficient usage of the provided tools. More importantly, it allows sharing analysis results, thereby, breaking up the isolation of different classroom projects and allowing all users to benefit from previous insights into the inner workings of student teams.

The use of a game-based project in engineering education: An examination of the academic learning, engagement and motivation of first-year engineering students;"Two critical issues are of great concern in engineering education today: the increasingly broad requirements for 21 st -century engineers and the lack of effective instructional approaches needed to produce students who meet the requirements. However, pedagogical approaches in engineering have remained relatively unchanged for the last 40 years and less effort has been placed on implementing instructional approaches needed to achieve the desired learning outcomes in engineering education. This study proposed an instructional approach that combined project- and game-based learning, using a sustainable/Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) game-based project in first-year engineering education. This approach combined features of both GBL (motivation, engagement and learning through doing) and PBL (accumulating professional skills through real-world projects). A concurrent transformative mixed-method approach was utilized in this study to investigate (1) the changes in students' knowledge of sustainable development and their perceptions of their professional skill development following completion of the project; and (2) how students' perceptions of their motivation and engagement in the project were related to those changes. This study involved 240 first-year engineering students from two of the sixteen sections of an ENGR 131 course at a large Midwestern university. The findings revealed that students had a positive learning experience in the sustainability game project and the instructional approach of combining project- and game-based learning was an effective approach for teaching engineering content knowledge, improving students' professional skill development, and enhancing their learning motivation. Students' perceptions of their engagement decreased after the project and multiple reasons (e.g., low academic expectations) were identified for the decrease. This study provided evidence that this instructional approach was effective in engineering education and helped address the issues facing engineering education and educators today.";1324104654;;;Dissertations & Theses;;Fang, Jun;;;" Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.";;; Dissertation/Thesis;;; 2012; 978-1-267-97993-3;;; English; English;;;;2012;ProQuest Dissertations and Theses;;2012;;;;https://search.proquest.com/docview/1324104654?accountid=11774;; 0710 Educational technology , 0745 Higher education , 0747 Vocational education; 0710 Educational technology , 0745 Higher education , 0747 Vocational education;; 0710 Educational technology , 0745 Higher education , 0747 Vocational education;;; 0710 Educational technology , 0745 Higher education , 0747 Vocational education; Educational technology , Higher education , Vocational education; Education , Engagement , Engineering education , Game-based learning , Instructional technology , Motivation , Project-based learning;;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:Publicly+Available+Content+Database&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+use+of+a+game-based+project+in+engineering+education%3A+An+examination+of+the+academic+learning%2C+engagement+and+motivation+of+first-year+engineering+students&amp;issn=&amp;date=2012-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Fang%2C+Jun&amp;isbn=978-1-267-97993-3&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/";ProQuest Central
Instructional Approaches on Science Performance, Attitude and Inquiry Ability in a Computer-Supported Collaborative Learning Environment;This study examined the effects of an inquiry-based learning (IBL) approach compared to that of a problem-based learning (PBL) approach on learner performance, attitude toward science and inquiry ability. Ninety-six students from three 7th-grade classes at a public school were randomly assigned to two experimental groups and one control group. All groups received the same web-based curriculum on the scientific topic of the greenhouse effect. These IBL groups, though, were asked to actively participate in the processes of predicting, hypothesizing, and testing, while the PBL groups were instructed to follow a specific problem-solving process. The results revealed that all students performed equally in science performance despite of the treatment groups. In terms of attitude toward science, the findings indicated that students participated in IBL or PBL groups reported more positive attitudes toward learning science and resulted in higher inquiry abilities than those who were in the control group. This study concerns itself with the features of the experimental treatment that may have contributed to these results, the implications of which are also considered.;1288341657;;;Scholarly Journals;;"CHEN, Ching-Huei;CHEN, Chia-Ying";;; Copyright Sakarya University 2012;;; Journal Article;;; 2012;;;1; English;;; n/a; Adapazari;2012;TOJET : The Turkish Online Journal of Educational Technology;;2012;;;11;https://search.proquest.com/docview/1288341657?accountid=11774;;;;;;; n/a;; Science education , Attitudes , Computers , Collaboration , Learning , Problem based learning , Computer assisted instruction--CAI , Cooperative learning , Greenhouse effect , Problem solving , Attitudes , Curricula , Collaborative virtual environments , Elementary education , Teaching methods , Learning environment , Attitudes , Problem solving , Students , Taiwan;;;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aeducation&amp;atitle=Instructional+Approaches+on+Science+Performance%2C+Attitude+and+Inquiry+Ability+in+a+Computer-Supported+Collaborative+Learning+Environment&amp;title=TOJET+%3A+The+Turkish+Online+Journal+of+Educational+Technology&amp;issn=&amp;date=2012-01-01&amp;volume=11&amp;issue=1&amp;spage=&amp;au=CHEN%2C+Ching-Huei%3BCHEN%2C+Chia-Ying&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=TOJET+%3A+The+Turkish+Online+Journal+of+Educational+Technology&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/";ProQuest Central,SciTech Premium Collection,Social Science Premium Collection
A Guideline for Game Development-Based Learning: A Literature Review;  This study aims at reviewing the published scientific literature on the topics of a game development-based learning (GDBL) method using game development frameworks (GDFs) with the perspective of (a) summarizing a guideline for using GDBL in a curriculum, (b) identifying relevant features of GDFs, and (c) presenting a synthesis of impact factors with empirical evidence on the educational effectiveness of the GDBL method. After systematically going through the available literature on the topic, 34 relevant articles were selected for the final study. We analyzed the articles from three perspectives: (1) pedagogical context and teaching process, (2) selection of GDFs, and (3) evaluation of the GDBL method. The findings from the 34 articles suggest that GDFs have many potential benefits as an aid to teach computer science, software engineering, art design, and other fields and that such GDFs combined with the motivation from games can improve the students' knowledge, skills, attitudes, and behaviors in contrast to the traditional classroom teaching. Furthermore, based on the results of the literature review, we extract a guideline of how to apply the GDBL method in education. The empirical evidence of current findings gives a positive overall picture and can provide a useful reference to educators, practitioners, and researchers in the area of game-based learning.;1272124835;;;Scholarly Journals;;"Wu, Bian;Wang, Alf Inge";;; Copyright © 2012 Bian Wu and Alf Inge Wang.

Challenges of a Project-based Learning Approach Towards Requirement Engineering;  Higher Learning Education (HLE) fails to deliver undergraduates with employability skills that expert in Requirement Engineering. The objective of this research is to identify challenges in the current practice of teaching Software Engineering at the undergraduate level in Requirement Engineering. To that reason, the Project-Based Learning (PjBL) proposed as well as a mechanism for educators in their delivery to assist students in enhancing their skill. The skills enhanced from the elicitation process until the management of requirement which students can easily apply in their employability skills.

Prospects on 'Open Source Software Development' Education to Technical Education Students of India;  With the success story of various open source software, open source software development during the last decade has got phenomenal momentum and attracted software developers around the world to join this revolution. Open Source Project hosting Websites like SourceForge, Google Code, GitHub, Codeplex, Launchpad etc. not only providing open source packages to the users but also providing development platform to the developers and still thousands of open source projects are in developing stage at these sites. Despite the success of OSS worldwide the adoption rate of OSS in India is very poor. Not only the usage of OSS but the participation in OSS development of Indian developer is also very less. Despite the fact that Indian universities are producing huge IT force and Indian developers are in the driving seats in software development, they are not among the list of top ten countries of OSS developer community. This paper study and analyzes the reasons behind the less involvement of Indian developers / students in OSS movement. We will conduct survey among the students of technical education to know their current status of knowledge towards the OSS, study the current learning pattern and software development practices of IT students, highlights the benefits of involving students in OSS development and proposes the changes in the syllabus for the adoption of study of OSS and OSS development in technical education of India;1018394063;;;Scholarly Journals;;"Tiwari, Vinay;Pandey, R K";;; Copyright Foundation of Computer Science 2012;; 10.5120/6962-9478; News;;; 2012;;0975-8887;12; English; English;;; New York;2012;International Journal of Computer Applications;;2012;;;46;https://search.proquest.com/docview/1018394063?accountid=11774;;;;;;; n/a;;;;;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Acomputerinfo&amp;atitle=Prospects+on+%27Open+Source+Software+Development%27+Education+to+Technical+Education+Students+of+India&amp;title=International+Journal+of+Computer+Applications&amp;issn=09758887&amp;date=2012-01-01&amp;volume=46&amp;issue=12&amp;spage=&amp;au=Tiwari%2C+Vinay%3BPandey%2C+R+K&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=International+Journal+of+Computer+Applications&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/10.5120%2F6962-9478";SciTech Premium Collection

Active learning environment: Applying the problem based learning approach to amoeba distributed operating system;  Problem-based learning refers to any learning environment in which the problem drives the learning, because it is posed m such a way that students realize they need to acquire new knowledge before the problem can be solved. By the help of this paper we are trying to present the experience of a structured problem-based learning approach to the teaching of an introductory study module on distributed operating system in the thud year of an Computer Engineering graduate program. Amoeba Distributed Operating System design problem was posed to students at the beginning of the module. Small groups of students worked on a cooperative learning project for six weeks, while the teacher acted as the coach and the facilitator of knowledge acquisition. Written reports were collected each week and the student assessments of the learning environment were measured. The paper closes with a list of recommendations intended to assist academics interested in adopting a similar approach.;1515639077;;;Conference Papers & Proceedings;;"Mishra, M;Mishra, VK;Sharma, HR";;; Copyright The Institution of Engineering & Technology Sep 14, 2011;; 10.1049/ic.2011.0065; Journal Article;;; Sep 14, 2011; 978-8-19106-918-1;;; English; English;;; Stevenage;Sep 14, 2011;IET Conference Proceedings;;2011;;;;https://search.proquest.com/docview/1515639077?accountid=11774;; C0220 Computing education and training , C6150J Operating systems , C6190 Distributed systems software; C0220 Computing education and training , C6150J Operating systems , C6190 Distributed systems software;; C0220 Computing education and training , C6150J Operating systems , C6190 Distributed systems software;; n/a; C0220 Computing education and training , C6150J Operating systems , C6190 Distributed systems software;; computer science education , distributed processing , knowledge management , operating systems (computers) , teaching , active learning environment , problem based learning approach , structured problem-based learning approach , introductory study module teaching , computer engineering graduate program , Amoeba distributed operating system design problem , cooperative learning project , knowledge acquisition , student assessment;;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:book&amp;genre=unknown&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Ahightechjournals&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Active+learning+environment%3A+Applying+the+problem+based+learning+approach+to+amoeba+distributed+operating+system&amp;issn=&amp;date=2011-09-14&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Mishra%2C+M%3BMishra%2C+VK%3BSharma%2C+HR&amp;isbn=978-8-19106-918-1&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=Active+learning+environment%3A+Applying+the+problem+based+learning+approach+to+amoeba+distributed+operating+system&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/10.1049%2Fic.2011.0065";ProQuest Central,SciTech Premium Collection
Reflections on the Role of the Lecturer as Teacher, Researcher and Mentor in a Project-Based Approach for IS/IT Majors at Three Different Academic Institutions;This paper focuses on the role of the lecturer embarking on a project-based approach to teaching in the IS/IT environment. An initial literature survey provides an understanding of the project-based approach, how it helps to prepare students for a changing business environment, and the expertise required of lecturers embarking on this approach. The authors then reflect on their own experiences in using the project-based approach to prepare students for future careers in IT. The paper explores their roles as teachers, mentors and researchers, discusses the challenges that were encountered, and identifies some critical success factors. From the lecturer's point of view, the project-based approach offers a win-win scenario for both students and lecturers: it gives students the competencies required by industry, while at the same time it gives lecturers the opportunity to keep up with industry expectations, and creates opportunities for sharing experiences with professional practitioners as well as fellow academics.

Teams Battling Teams: Introducing Software Engineering Education in the First-Year with RoboCode;"Teams Battling Teams: Introducing Software Engineering Education in the First Year with ROBOCODEIn many computer science programs, the acquisition of software engineering skills is limited toonly a few discrete curricular points, such as introductory software engineering and capstonecourses. This presents two significant challenges: First, the study of software engineeringbecomes overly focused within isolated courses. Second, when students do first encounter thechallenges of software engineering learning activities in these courses, they are generallyunprepared.In order to address these difficulties, we have introduced a challenging and engaging teamsoftware engineering project into our first-year introductory programming sequence. Using theROBOCODE robotic combat simulator [4] (see Figure 1), students work on developing acooperative team of robots that competes in tournaments against teams built by their fellowstudents. Key goals with this curricular enhancement are to better integrate software engineeringeducation in the entirety of our program and to first introduce team- and project-based softwareengineering activities in a low-risk setting in order to create a smoother student learning curve.The ROBOCODE simulator allows students to hone their JAVA programming skills by buildingautonomous robots that fight on a simulated battlefield. While ROBOCODE is conventionally usedfor individual programming projects [2], our work is a novel divergence that leverages thesimulator’s support for the development of robot teams in which robots of the same team maycoordinate their actions in addition to collecting concrete evaluative data. We strongly espouse aproblem-based and experiential learning approach [5, 3], and fostering a friendly competitionsetting significantly increases the degree of student involvement and commitment that is a keyfactor in fostering student learning [1].Our novel team- and problem-based project is integrated into the final six weeks of our first-yearprogramming language sequence. While under close instructor supervision over groupingconcerns, students engage in such software engineering activities as the elaboration ofrequirements, creation of prototype robots, implementation and testing of final executable robots,and giving short presentations on their robot design. The project is grounded in two tournament-style competitions: Students use their early prototypes in a preliminary tournament, whichprovides insight into their competitors’ behaviors and motivates students to improve their ownrobots, while a final tournament battle allows the most effective robotic teams to emerge.Based on quantitative and qualitative results from surveys of participating students in two termsas well as from our own observations, we have found this project to be quite effective. Forexample, 75% of students agreed or strongly agreed that this assignment made them moreenthusiastic about the course material. One student reported a favorite part of the assignment as“designing modular classes and just thinking how the thing itself will come together” whileanother found the most useful element of the project to be the “notion of team programming aswell as designing behaviors.”Perhaps most importantly, the project fostered a high degree of student involvement andenthusiasm: Tournaments were active and entertaining, with students cheering for teams andcongratulating each other on victories. One student said that the project is a “cool idea;Robocode is addictive.” Some less positive results included the perception by some students thatthe project was simply too time-consuming, especially in terms of teamwork overhead. Whilethese criticisms are somewhat expected for an undergraduate team project, we are carefullyconsidering these formative assessment results for future course offerings.

Personality in software engineering: preliminary findings from a systematic literature review;  Background The influence of individual personalities on individual tasks and team work has been a concern in software engineering over the past 50 years. However, how to use personality analysis and what it can offer for the practice of software engineering is still subject to debate among researchers. Aim The goal of this work is to identify the methods used, topics addressed, personality tests applied, and the main findings produced in the research about personality in software engineering. Method We performed a systematic literature review of peer reviewed studies published between 1970 and 2010. Results Data extracted from 42 studies shows that pair programming and team building are the most recurring research topics and MBTI is the most used test. Conclusions Contradicting evidences were found that may have been caused by differences in context, research method, and versions of the tests used in the studies. While this raises a warning for practitioners that wish to use of personality tests in practice, it shows several opportunities for researchers.;1775464665;;;Conference Papers & Proceedings;;"Cruz, SSJO;da Silva, FQB;Monteiro, CVF;Santos, CF;dos Santos, MT";;; Copyright The Institution of Engineering & Technology Apr 11, 2011;; 10.1049/ic.2011.0001; Journal Article;;; Apr 11, 2011; 978-1-84919-509-6;;; English; English;;; Stevenage;Apr 11, 2011;IET Conference Proceedings;;2011;;;;https://search.proquest.com/docview/1775464665?accountid=11774;; C6110B Software engineering techniques; C6110B Software engineering techniques;; C6110B Software engineering techniques;; n/a; C6110B Software engineering techniques;; software engineering , preliminary findings , systematic literature review , individual personalities , individual tasks , personality tests , pair programming , team building , MBTI , research method;;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:book&amp;genre=unknown&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Ahightechjournals&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Personality+in+software+engineering%3A+preliminary+findings+from+a+systematic+literature+review&amp;issn=&amp;date=2011-04-11&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Cruz%2C+SSJO%3Bda+Silva%2C+FQB%3BMonteiro%2C+CVF%3BSantos%2C+CF%3Bdos+Santos%2C+MT&amp;isbn=978-1-84919-509-6&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=Personality+in+software+engineering%3A+preliminary+findings+from+a+systematic+literature+review&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/10.1049%2Fic.2011.0001";ProQuest Central,SciTech Premium Collection
Problem-based Learning: Influence on Students' Learning in an Electrical Engineering Course;  Recently, there has been a shift from using lecture-based teaching methods in undergraduate engineering courses to using more learner-centered teaching approaches, such as problem-based learning. However, research on the impact of these approaches has mainly involved student perceptions of the teaching method and anecdotal and opinion pieces by faculty on their use of the teaching method, rather than empirically collected data on students' learning outcomes. This paper describes an investigation of the impact of problem-based learning (PBL) on undergraduate electrical engineering students' conceptual understanding and their perceptions of learning using PBL as compared to lecture. Fifty-five students enrolled in an electrical engineering course at a Midwestern university participated in this research. The study utilized a within-subjects A-B-A-B research design with traditional lecture as the baseline phase and problem-based learning as the experimental phase of the study. Participants completed pre- and post-tests surrounding the four topics covered in the study and also completed a Student Assessment of Learning Gains (SALG) survey. Results suggested participants' learning gains from PBL were twice their gains from traditional lecture. Even though students learned more from PBL, students thought they learned more from traditional lecture. We discuss these findings and offer implications for faculty interested in implementing PBL. Given the limited research on the beneficial effects of PBL on student learning, this study provides empirical support for PBL. We discuss findings from this study and provide specific implications for faculty and researchers interested in problem-based learning in engineering.;873571059;;;Scholarly Journals;;"Yadav, Aman;Subedi, Dipendra;Lundeberg, Mary A;Bunting, Charles F"; JEEDEQ;; Copyright AMERICAN SOCIETY FOR ENGINEERING EDUCATION Apr 2011;;; Feature;;; Apr 2011;;1069-4730;2; English; English;; 253-280; Washington;Apr 2011;Journal of Engineering Education;;2011;;;100;https://search.proquest.com/docview/873571059?accountid=11774;;;; Graphs , Tables , References;;; 253;; Learning , Electrical engineering , Teaching methods , College students , Higher education , Mathematical models;;;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aeducation&amp;atitle=Problem-based+Learning%3A+Influence+on+Students%27+Learning+in+an+Electrical+Engineering+Course&amp;title=Journal+of+Engineering+Education&amp;issn=10694730&amp;date=2011-04-01&amp;volume=100&amp;issue=2&amp;spage=253&amp;au=Yadav%2C+Aman%3BSubedi%2C+Dipendra%3BLundeberg%2C+Mary+A%3BBunting%2C+Charles+F&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=Journal+of+Engineering+Education&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/";ProQuest Central,SciTech Premium Collection,Social Science Premium Collection
The Design and Development of a Computerized Tool Support for Conducting Senior Projects in Software Engineering Education;This paper presents a computerized tool support, the Meetings-Flow Project Collaboration System (MFS), for designing, directing and sustaining the collaborative teamwork required in senior projects in software engineering (SE) education. Among many schools' SE curricula, senior projects serve as a capstone course that provides comprehensive training in collaborative project development. With the focus on collaboration training, instructors of senior projects often address issues that include how to encourage collaboration and ensure that collaborative efforts are sustained throughout the project's development. In order to help resolve these issues, the MFS takes a holistic approach. The meetings-flow concept that undergirds the MFS introduces a novel macro-level and meeting-oriented group process to guide the proceeding of the project's collaborative work. The design of the MFS facilitates a computerized environment that helps to institutionalize and monitor such a group process. In introducing the MFS, we focus initially on the elaboration of the concept and design, after which we present and validate the system implementation and usage. We also evaluate the MFS and receive a positive result with respect to the educational issues raised in this paper. Finally, we comparatively summarize the MFS to discuss its values and the role it plays in CSCL (computer supported collaborative learning) and PBL (project-based learning) of SE education.

Software engineering education: A study on conducting collaborative senior project development;Project and teamwork training is recognized as an important aspect in software engineering (SE) education. Senior projects, which often feature industrial involvement, serve the function of a 'capstone course' in SE curricula, by offering comprehensive training in collaborative software development. Given the characteristics of student team projects and the social aspects of software development, instructional issues in such a course must include: how to encourage teamwork, how to formalize and streamline stakeholder participation, and how to monitor students' work, as well as sustain their desired collaborative effort throughout the development. In this paper, we present an exploratory study which highlights a particular case and introduces the meetings-flow approach. In order to investigate how this approach could contribute to the project's results, we examined its quantitative benefits in relation to the development of the project.

The educational experiences of software designers working in education/instructional technology related fields;As custom-built educational software becomes ever more complex, there is an increasing need for software design skills (including software architecture, business and technical requirements gathering, high- and low-level design, and programming) to produce high-quality software. However, it is unclear whether there is a typical educational path for computing professionals working on this area, or to what degree these software designers feel that domain-specific knowledge is required in order to succeed in this area. This three-phase mixed-methods study explores the formal (university) and non-formal (including work-sponsored, self-taught, and informal) educational experiences of software designers currently working in this field. Gaps between what is needed on the job and what is taught in school are highlighted, and participants' recommendations for improving educational programs to prepare students for entering this field are summarized. Implications for researchers, educators, and hiring managers are discussed. Findings indicate that software design professionals come from variety of backgrounds, which include multiple formal educational paths and a wide variety of life experiences. Computing fields (such as Computer Science) and Instructional Design are two common starting points for professionals in this field. Regardless of formal educational background software designers typically play a number of roles over time, both within and outside of educational software development. Participants indicate that critical thinking, communication skills, and the ability to learn on one's own are among the most important competencies needed on the job, and that these should be taught alongside Computing and/or Instructional Design foundations. Recommendations for educational programs focus on developing those skills through real-world experiences such as team projects.;919077792;;;Dissertations & Theses;;Exter, Marisa E.;;;" Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.";;; Dissertation/Thesis;;; 2011; 978-1-267-13830-9;;; English; English;;;;2011;ProQuest Dissertations and Theses;;2011;;;;https://search.proquest.com/docview/919077792?accountid=11774;; 0447 Instructional Design , 0651 Continuing education , 0710 Educational technology , 0745 Higher education , 0984 Computer science; 0447 Instructional Design , 0651 Continuing education , 0710 Educational technology , 0745 Higher education , 0984 Computer science;; 0447 Instructional Design , 0651 Continuing education , 0710 Educational technology , 0745 Higher education , 0984 Computer science;;; 0447 Instructional Design , 0651 Continuing education , 0710 Educational technology , 0745 Higher education , 0984 Computer science; Instructional Design , Continuing education , Educational technology , Higher education , Computer science , Educational software; Education , Applied sciences , Computer science , Continuing professional education , Higher education , Instructional systems technology , Lifelong learning , Self-learning , Software designers;;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:Education+Database&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+educational+experiences+of+software+designers+working+in+education%2Finstructional+technology+related+fields&amp;issn=&amp;date=2011-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Exter%2C+Marisa+E.&amp;isbn=978-1-267-13830-9&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/";ProQuest Central,Social Science Premium Collection
Social loafing and free riding in online learning groups;"Social loafing research has spanned several decades and fields of study. Research has provided support for both the existence of social loafing and its antecedents within the laboratory, classroom, and work place. Studies regarding the perceptions of social loafing and its effects in the online learning environment, however, are largely non-existent. In 2008, a research study was conducted with the Naval War College and two public universities (Piezon &amp; Ferree, 2008). This study surveyed 227 online learning students who were participating in online learning groups. The study sought to determine whether the perception of social loafing existed within online learning groups. In addition, several psychosocial factors identified in face-to-face environments were analyzed to determine their impact in online learning groups. The study provided evidence that supports both the perception of social loafing in online learning groups as well as similarities between social loafing antecedents in face-to-face groups and those in the online learning environment. This current research project extends the 2008 study to include community college and undergraduate students in addition to the graduate students and Naval War College students in the original study. In addition, the study was expanded to include both qualitative and quantitative data. This extended study included 343 web-based survey participants and 28 interview participants. This study sought to determine whether social loafing exists at the two-year, four-year, and graduate level. In addition, the data was examined for differences in perceptions between each of the four study groups and relationships between the survey sub-scales. Finally, this study sought to determine the ability of the social loafing sub-scales to predict social loafing behaviors in online learning groups at the two-year, four-year, and graduate level.";897114500;;;Dissertations & Theses;;Piezon, Sherry L.;;;" Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.";;; Dissertation/Thesis;;; 2011; 978-1-124-91874-7;;; English; English;;;;2011;ProQuest Dissertations and Theses;;2011;;;;https://search.proquest.com/docview/897114500?accountid=11774;; 0459 Communication , 0525 Educational psychology , 0723 Information science; 0459 Communication , 0525 Educational psychology , 0723 Information science;; 0459 Communication , 0525 Educational psychology , 0723 Information science;;; 0459 Communication , 0525 Educational psychology , 0723 Information science; Communication , Educational psychology , Information science; Communication and the arts , Education , Collaborative learning , Free riding , Group work , Online learning , Social loafing;;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:Social+Science+Database&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Social+loafing+and+free+riding+in+online+learning+groups&amp;issn=&amp;date=2011-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Piezon%2C+Sherry+L.&amp;isbn=978-1-124-91874-7&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/";ProQuest Central,Social Science Premium Collection
Creating Industry-Ready Ph.D. Graduates;In the United States, engineering doctoral education is frequently designed to prepare graduates to become original researchers and work in an academic or a national lab. Yet, the majority of engineering Ph.D. graduates are being employed in industry which leads to the question of how well are doctoral programs preparing students to meet industry's needs. The broad research objective is to contribute to our understanding of how engineering doctoral programs can better prepare graduates for careers in industry. In order to accomplish the objective, current engineering doctoral programs and job solicitations for Ph.D. engineers were reviewed. Surveys and interviews were developed and administered in order to understand the skills and work environment of Ph.D. engineers. Results indicate that overall doctoral students' academic preparation aligns with the needs of industry. Yet, interdisciplinary teamwork and an understanding of the economics and goals of an industrial work environment could be better addressed. Several instructional strategies have been identified that develop students' transferable skills, but they have not been adequately assessed in the literature. One particular strategy of interest was a seminar series as it is often required or offered as part of doctoral programs. A non-technical seminar series was developed to investigate how doctoral students perceive the value of skills identified in the job solicitation review and surveys. Results suggest that a seminar series is an effective strategy to help doctoral students gain an awareness of the non-technical skills needed for careers in industry.;890142491;;;Dissertations & Theses;;Watson, Joy;;;" Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.";;; Dissertation/Thesis;;; 2011; 978-1-124-84798-6;;; English; English;;;;2011;ProQuest Dissertations and Theses;;2011;;;;https://search.proquest.com/docview/890142491?accountid=11774;; 0537 Engineering , 0745 Higher education; 0537 Engineering , 0745 Higher education;; 0537 Engineering , 0745 Higher education;;; 0537 Engineering , 0745 Higher education; Engineering , Higher education; Education , Applied sciences , Engineering doctoral programs , Engineers , Industry-ready , Ph.D. graduates , Skills;;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:Matericals+Science+%26+Engineering+Dissertations&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Creating+Industry-Ready+Ph.D.+Graduates&amp;issn=&amp;date=2011-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Watson%2C+Joy&amp;isbn=978-1-124-84798-6&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/";SciTech Premium Collection
A National Survey of Instructional Strategies Used to Teach Information Systems Courses: An Exploratory Investigation;"Many universities and colleges have placed increased emphasis on teaching excellence in higher education. Efforts to promote teaching excellence vary from the development of alternative new pedagogies as well as research exploring strategies to improve existing teaching practices. Logically, different disciplines employ different instructional strategies to prepare their graduates with specific skills, knowledge, and attitudes. This study examined the instructional strategies used most frequently in the information systems discipline and was inspired by Shulman's (2005) concept of signature pedagogies—the unique but pervasive ways of teaching within a discipline or profession. This dissertation reports a national survey of instructional strategies used across the information systems discipline. The study employed a web-based survey of all information systems faculty members in the United States listed in the Association of Information Systems membership directory (695 valid responses were obtained from 2,835 eligible participants, 24.4% response rate). The research used an original questionnaire identifying 52 different instructional strategies to create a profile of commonly employed teaching practices and to identify whether there are identifiable signature pedagogies in the discipline of Information Systems (IS). Data analyses included descriptive statistics, factor analysis of the survey items, and multiple regression of eight independent variables to predict frequency of instructional strategy used. This quantitative study is the first systematic investigation profiling the instructional strategies and signature pedagogies used in the IS discipline. The results show domination of lecture-based strategies across the information systems discipline. Over 66% of the participants identified lecture as their most frequently used teaching method. Based on the frequency of responses to ""Frequently"" and ""Almost Always/Always"", lecture was identified as the most frequently used strategy. The next most commonly employed strategies were interactive lectures (63%), cooperative learning/team-based learning (53%), problem-based learning (53%), whole group discussions (50%), and demonstrations (49%). Participants were also asked to select their ""three most frequently used"" strategies to identify potential signature pedagogies. Their responses again identified lectures and interactive lectures as the dominant strategies. Viewing these as generic strategies, the following additional frequently used strategies might point to potential signature pedagogies in the discipline: lab activities, case study, analysis and design project, and whole group discussion. This initial investigation focused exclusively on what Shulman (2005) has identified as the surface structure of the pedagogies. Further studies are recommended to also examine the deep and implicit structures to more definitively identify signature pedagogies in the IS discipline. The exploratory factor analysis revealed patterns of instructional strategies usage in the IS discipline. ix factors were identified: in-class active learning strategies, highly-structured active learning strategies, online learning strategies, project-based strategies, writing-based strategies, and portfolio strategies. The internal consistency reliability (Cronbach's Alpha) of the six factors ranged from .67 to .87 on each of the factors formed. Composite means of the factors showed that highly-structured active learning strategies and project-based strategies were the two most frequently used groups of instructional strategies groups across the IS discipline. This study further found that six of eight demographic and course characteristics (i.e., gender, rank, age, course level, delivery format, and class size) were associated significantly with instructional strategies usage depending on both the group of instructional strategies and the type of instructional strategies. Years of prior teaching experience and availability of student assistants were the two non-significant demographic and course characteristics. This study profiles the teaching practices currently employed in the IS discipline in the United States. Recommendations for future research are described along with suggestions for improving teaching and faculty development initiatives in the IS discipline. Additionally, possibilities for future research both within the IS discipline and across other disciplines are presented.";886427540;;;Dissertations & Theses;;Djajalaksana, Yenni M.;;;" Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.";;; Dissertation/Thesis;;; 2011; 978-1-124-80989-2;;; English; English;;;;2011;ProQuest Dissertations and Theses;;2011;;;;https://search.proquest.com/docview/886427540?accountid=11774;; 0446 Higher Education Administration , 0745 Higher education , 0747 Vocational education; 0446 Higher Education Administration , 0745 Higher education , 0747 Vocational education;; 0446 Higher Education Administration , 0745 Higher education , 0747 Vocational education;;; 0446 Higher Education Administration , 0745 Higher education , 0747 Vocational education; Higher Education Administration , Higher education , Vocational education , Colleges & universities , Polls & surveys , Information systems; Education , Active learning , Higher education , Information systems , Instrument development , Signature pedagogies , Teaching methods;;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:Education+Database&amp;atitle=&amp;title=A+National+Survey+of+Instructional+Strategies+Used+to+Teach+Information+Systems+Courses%3A+An+Exploratory+Investigation&amp;issn=&amp;date=2011-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Djajalaksana%2C+Yenni+M.&amp;isbn=978-1-124-80989-2&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/";ProQuest Central,Social Science Premium Collection
The Effect of Problem-Solving Instruction on the Programming Self-efficacy and Achievement of Introductory Computer Science Students;"Research in academia and industry continues to identify a decline in enrollment in computer science. One major component of this decline in enrollment is a shortage of female students. The primary reasons for the gender gap presented in the research include lack of computer experience prior to their first year in college, misconceptions about the field, negative cultural stereotypes, lack of female mentors and role models, subtle discriminations in the classroom, and lack of self-confidence (Pollock, McCoy, Carberry, Hundigopal, &amp; You, 2004). Male students are also leaving the field due to misconceptions about the field, negative cultural stereotypes, and a lack of self-confidence. Analysis of first year attrition revealed that one of the major challenges faced by students of both genders is a lack of problem-solving skills (Beaubouef, Lucas &amp; Howatt, 2001; Olsen, 2005; Paxton &amp; Mumey, 2001). The purpose of this study was to investigate whether specific, non-mathematical problem-solving instruction as part of introductory programming courses significantly increased computer programming self-efficacy and achievement of students. The results of this study showed that students in the experimental group had significantly higher achievement than students in the control group. While this shows statistical significance, due to the effect size and disordinal nature of the data between groups, care has to be taken in its interpretation. The study did not show significantly higher programming self-efficacy among the experimental students. There was not enough data collected to statistically analyze the effect of the treatment on self-efficacy and achievement by gender. However, differences in means were observed between the gender groups, with females in the experimental group demonstrating a higher than average degree of self-efficacy when compared with males in the experimental group and both genders in the control group. These results suggest that the treatment from this study may provide a gender-based increase in self-efficacy and future research should focus on exploring this possibility.";884796506;;;Dissertations & Theses;;Maddrey, Elizabeth;;;" Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.";;; Dissertation/Thesis;;; 2011; 978-1-124-79198-2;;; English; English;;;;2011;ProQuest Dissertations and Theses;;2011;;;;https://search.proquest.com/docview/884796506?accountid=11774;; 0525 Educational psychology , 0710 Educational technology , 0714 Science education; 0525 Educational psychology , 0710 Educational technology , 0714 Science education;; 0525 Educational psychology , 0710 Educational technology , 0714 Science education;;; 0525 Educational psychology , 0710 Educational technology , 0714 Science education; Educational psychology , Educational technology , Science education , Problem solving , Computer science , Academic achievement , Students , Computer programming; Education , Computer science education , Programming self-efficacy , Shrinking pipeline , Women in computing;;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:Education+Database&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+Effect+of+Problem-Solving+Instruction+on+the+Programming+Self-efficacy+and+Achievement+of+Introductory+Computer+Science+Students&amp;issn=&amp;date=2011-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Maddrey%2C+Elizabeth&amp;isbn=978-1-124-79198-2&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/";ProQuest Central,Social Science Premium Collection
The Emergence of Engineering Education Research as an Internationally Connected Field of Inquiry;  In recent years, engineering education research (EER) has emerged as an internationally connected field of inquiry through the establishment of EER conferences, interest groups within engineering education societies, Ph.D. programs, and departments and centers at universities. Improving the preparation and training of engineers through EER is critical to solving major engineering challenges in sustainability, climate change, civil infrastructure, energy, and public health. The purpose of this article is twofold: (1) to introduce EER as a field of inquiry, and (2) to describe the U.S. and Northern and Central European approaches to EER as two examples of the diversity of approaches. The article is organized around a framework from the European didaktik tradition, which focuses on answering the w-questions of education. The major sections describe what, why, to what end, where, who, and how EER is conducted. Northern and Central European educational approaches focus on authentic, complex problems, while U.S. approaches emphasize empirical evidence. Additionally, disciplinary boundaries and legitimacy are more salient issues in the U.S., while the Northern and Central European Bildung philosophy integrates across disciplines toward development of the whole person. Understanding and valuing complementary perspectives is critical to growth and internationalization of EER.;857255466;;;Scholarly Journals;;"Borrego, Maura;Bernhard, Jonte"; JEEDEQ;; Copyright AMERICAN SOCIETY FOR ENGINEERING EDUCATION Jan 2011;;; Feature;;; Jan 2011;;1069-4730;1; English; English;; 14-47; Washington;Jan 2011;Journal of Engineering Education;;2011;;;100;https://search.proquest.com/docview/857255466?accountid=11774;;;; References , Tables;;; 14;; Low income groups , Engineering , Marketing , Multiculturalism & pluralism , Problems , Higher education;;;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aeducation&amp;atitle=The+Emergence+of+Engineering+Education+Research+as+an+Internationally+Connected+Field+of+Inquiry&amp;title=Journal+of+Engineering+Education&amp;issn=10694730&amp;date=2011-01-01&amp;volume=100&amp;issue=1&amp;spage=14&amp;au=Borrego%2C+Maura%3BBernhard%2C+Jonte&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=Journal+of+Engineering+Education&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/";ProQuest Central,SciTech Premium Collection,Social Science Premium Collection
An integrated approach to teaching and learning logistics: A case study;Business managers and students often criticise university teaching for not addressing real-life problems. Furthermore, professors are dissatisfied with the research capabilities of postgraduate students. This paper advocates an integrated approach to teaching and learning based on the features of project-based learning aimed at enhancing the practical and research skills of undergraduate students in Logistics. A case study is presented where third-year students were engaged in a real-life project in collaboration with industry, exposing them to collaborative learning, questionnaire design, surveys, analysing and evaluating results, literature review and report writing. The project was carried out in phases where students were assessed after each phase. The paper analyses the assessment of students and their perception of the value of the project. It is concluded that an integrated teaching and learning approach will increase students’ interest in the subject, understanding of theoretical concepts, research skills, business skills and life skills.;1898641280;;;Scholarly Journals;;Cronjé, Jacobus N;;; Copyright AOSIS (Pty) Ltd 2011;; 10.4102/jtscm.v5i1.21; Journal Article;;; 2011;;2310-8789;1; English; English;;; Johannesburg;2011;Journal of Transport and Supply Chain Management;;2011;;;5;https://search.proquest.com/docview/1898641280?accountid=11774;;;;;;; n/a;; Students , Collaboration , Skills , Case studies , Literature reviews , Logistics;;;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aabiglobal&amp;atitle=An+integrated+approach+to+teaching+and+learning+logistics%3A+A+case+study&amp;title=Journal+of+Transport+and+Supply+Chain+Management&amp;issn=23108789&amp;date=2011-01-01&amp;volume=5&amp;issue=1&amp;spage=&amp;au=Cronj%C3%A9%2C+Jacobus+N&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=Journal+of+Transport+and+Supply+Chain+Management&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/10.4102%2Fjtscm.v5i1.21";ProQuest Central,SciTech Premium Collection
Teams Battling Teams: Introducing Software Engineering Education in the First Year with ROBOCODE;In order to be effective software engineers, computer science undergraduate students must master not only core theoretical computer science foundations and programming skills, but also a variety of competencies having to do with design, the preparation of software-related documentation, and soft skills relating to effective teamwork. In many traditionally structured computer science programs, the acquisition of these software engineering skills is localized in very few points in the already dense computer science curriculum: most commonly in an introductory software engineering course that precedes a final, senior year capstone course. This curricular structure presents educators with two significant challenges: First, it makes the study and application of software engineering skills overly focused within the context of isolated, discrete courses. While understandably driven by the tight confines of the undergraduate curriculum, this isolation results in the perception that the content of such courses are a skill-set with limited applicability. Second, it means that students are generally unprepared for the challenges of software engineering learning activities when first encountered. With most introductory software engineering courses applying experiential learning and couching learning activities in the context of a team-based project, the challenge of mastering course content is complicated by what is, for most students, their first significant experience with teaming and the difficulties of managing not just their own work but also the work of their teammates.;1372618080; 18045551;;Scholarly Journals;;Georgas, John C;;;; Georgas, John C;; Journal Article , Conference;;; 2011;;;; English; English;; 01029-01012;;2011;American Society for Engineering Education. pp. 01029-12. 2011.; CSAPTjournals , CSAPTconferences;2011; American Society for Engineering Education;;;https://search.proquest.com/docview/1372618080?accountid=11774; American Society for Engineering Education. pp. 01029-12. 2011.; 93  Solid State and Superconductivity Education (SO) , 80  Management and Marketing (MT) , 93  Electronics and Communications Education (EA) , 93  Computers and Education (CI) , 80  Management and Marketing (CE); 93  Solid State and Superconductivity Education (SO) , 80  Management and Marketing (MT) , 93  Electronics and Communications Education (EA) , 93  Computers and Education (CI) , 80  Management and Marketing (CE);; 93  Solid State and Superconductivity Education (SO) , 80  Management and Marketing (MT) , 93  Electronics and Communications Education (EA) , 93  Computers and Education (CI) , 80  Management and Marketing (CE);; 01029; 93  Solid State and Superconductivity Education (SO) , 80  Management and Marketing (MT) , 93  Electronics and Communications Education (EA) , 93  Computers and Education (CI) , 80  Management and Marketing (CE); Skills , Computer programs , Learning , Education , Conferences , Perception , Students , Software engineering;;;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Acivilengineering&amp;atitle=Teams+Battling+Teams%3A+Introducing+Software+Engineering+Education+in+the+First+Year+with+ROBOCODE&amp;title=&amp;issn=&amp;date=2011-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=01029&amp;au=Georgas%2C+John+C&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/18045551&amp;rft_id=info:doi/";SciTech Premium Collection

Innovative problem-oriented pedagogies in engineering education: Conceptualizations and management of tensions;The demands on engineering educators are high and they are being challenged to create learning environments that not only teach technical skills better, but also incorporate process skills and foster other graduate attributes. Problem-based learning (and its variants) has been deemed to meet the needs of educators and society in preparing the engineers of the 21 st century. But with pedagogical innovations like PBL, comfortable routines related to the structure and flow of classroom activity are disrupted for both educators and students. In addition to having to manage changes within their classroom processes and routines, engineering educators must also interact and operate within the larger systems in which their classrooms are embedded, the university. The structure and culture of the university system may facilitate or hinder the teaching intentions and goals of educators, as this larger system can impose its own set of tensions. The purpose of this qualitative study was to explore and describe the variation in engineering educators' ways of experiencing tensions in PBL implementations, as well as how they managed the tensions. In the specific context of the first two years of undergraduate engineering education, the research questions were (1) based on their teaching practices, what are the predominant tensions encountered by engineering educators? (2) What are the qualitatively different ways in which engineering educators experience tensions with a PBL implementation in their teaching practices? (3) How do engineering educators manage these tensions? The methodology used was phenomenography, a research framework that focuses on the relationship between a phenomenon and people's conception of the phenomenon. Data were collected through an online survey. The survey served as a sampling strategy and respondents who met inclusion criteria were invited to participate in semi-structured interviews. The population was engineering educators in the United States who were implementing problem-based learning (PBL), and all its variants (i.e., project-based learning) within their engineering teaching practice. The sample of survey respondents was 313, while the sample for interviews was 14. This study was informed by activity theory as the theoretical lens. It provided this author with the language to describe the embedded nature of the activity systems in which engineering educators found themselves with their implementations and management of an active learning approach (PBL) in a traditionally subject-centered, lecture-based hierarchical engineering education culture. Results revealed that the predominant tensions encountered by these engineering educators in this study were the students' initial discomfort with the transition to PBL, the educators' role as instructor versus facilitator, and the individual versus the organizational value assigned to teaching. Tensions related to the students' initial discomfort with the transition to PBL were addressed by managing expectations and aligning learning activities with the learner level. Tensions related to the educators' role as instructor versus facilitator were managed by shifting the relationship between the content, the student, and the instructor, and optimizing the use of the instructor during class time. Finally, tensions of depth versus breadth of curriculum were managed by making adjustments to the learning environment, to the content, and to the use of instructor and class time. Implications, limitations, and future research are discussed.;1014166252;;;Dissertations & Theses;;van Barneveld, Evangelia;;;" Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.";;; Dissertation/Thesis;;; 2011; 978-1-267-31157-3;;; English; English;;;;2011;ProQuest Dissertations and Theses;;2011;;;;https://search.proquest.com/docview/1014166252?accountid=11774;; 0447 Instructional Design , 0710 Educational technology , 0747 Vocational education; 0447 Instructional Design , 0710 Educational technology , 0747 Vocational education;; 0447 Instructional Design , 0710 Educational technology , 0747 Vocational education;;; 0447 Instructional Design , 0710 Educational technology , 0747 Vocational education; Instructional Design , Educational technology , Vocational education; Education , Engineering education , Innovative pedagogy , Problem-based learning , Project-based learning;;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:Publicly+Available+Content+Database&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Innovative+problem-oriented+pedagogies+in+engineering+education%3A+Conceptualizations+and+management+of+tensions&amp;issn=&amp;date=2011-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=van+Barneveld%2C+Evangelia&amp;isbn=978-1-267-31157-3&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/";ProQuest Central
Promoting Collaboration in a Project-Based E-Learning Context;In this paper we investigate the value of collaboration scripts for promoting metacognitive knowledge in a project-based e-learning context. In an empirical study, 82 students worked individually and in groups on a project using the e-learning environment MyProject, in which the life cycle of a project is inherent. Students followed a particular collaboration script that combines individual and collaborative activities, aiming to promote individual and socially shared reflective thinking during the planning and evaluation phases of the project. We analysed group discussions and evaluation questionnaires, and the results provide evidence about the importance of the design variables considered in the collaboration script for cultivating metacognitive knowledge, such as project phase, roles undertaken by students, degree and type of interaction, type of activities and products, and activity sequencing.;2025777066;;;Scholarly Journals; School of Pedagogical & Technological Education , University of Athens;"Papanikolaou, Kyparisia;Boubouka, Maria";;; Copyright Taylor & Francis Ltd.

The effects of using problem-based learning in science and technology teaching upon students' academic achievement and levels of structuring concepts;"The present study aimed to investigate the impact of the problem-based learning method used in science and technology teaching upon elementary school students' construction levels for the concepts concerning the ""Systems in Our Body"" unit in the science and technology course and their academic achievement. To this end, during the four-week experimental application process, the course was taught using the problem-based learning method in the experimental group and the control group curriculum was only based on the science and technology textbook. The study used two groups including the experimental (n=20) and control (n=21) groups, and the study used the pretest posttest control group semi-experimental design. The analysis of the obtained data revealed a significant difference in favor of the experimental group on students' scores on the academic achievement test and the open-ended questions that identified their construction levels for the concepts. This study should guide further studies and to help determine the effectiveness of the method in question on elementary school students.";1955058854;;;Scholarly Journals; Usak University, Faculty of Education, Department of Science Education, Usak, TURKEY Email: dideminel@gmail.com , Dokuz Eylul University, Faculty of Education, Department of Science Education, Izmir, TURKEY;"Inel, Didem;Balim, Ali Günay";;; Copyright The Education University of Hong Kong, Department of Science and Environmental Studies Dec 2010;;; Journal Article;;; Dec 2010;;;2; English; English;; 1-23; Hong Kong;Dec 2010;Asia - Pacific Forum on Science Learning and Teaching;;2010;;;11;https://search.proquest.com/docview/1955058854?accountid=11774;;;;;;; 1;; International conferences , Cooperative learning , Teaching methods , Problems , Achievement tests , Concept mapping , Curricula , Science education , Academic achievement , Knowledge , Science teachers , Critical thinking , Cognitive ability , Problem based learning , Cognition & reasoning;;;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aeducation&amp;atitle=The+effects+of+using+problem-based+learning+in+science+and+technology+teaching+upon+students%27+academic+achievement+and+levels+of+structuring+concepts&amp;title=Asia+-+Pacific+Forum+on+Science+Learning+and+Teaching&amp;issn=&amp;date=2010-12-01&amp;volume=11&amp;issue=2&amp;spage=1&amp;au=Inel%2C+Didem%3BBalim%2C+Ali+G%C3%BCnay&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=Asia+-+Pacific+Forum+on+Science+Learning+and+Teaching&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/";ProQuest Central,Social Science Premium Collection
Database Design Learning: A Project-Based Approach Organized through a Course Management System;This paper describes an active method for database design learning through practical tasks development by student teams in a face-to-face course. This method integrates project-based learning, and project management techniques and tools. Some scaffolding is provided at the beginning that forms a skeleton that adapts to a great variety of student-proposed domain projects and emulates the real way of working in database design. We include a quasi-experimental study in which the results of five academic years are analyzed. The first three years a traditional strategy was followed and a course management system was used as material repository. The active method was introduced for the last two years and coexisted with the traditional one. The course management system greatly simplifies the management of the numerous documents produced, the description and scheduling of tasks, the identification of teams, as well as all communication needs. In this study we analyze aspects such as exam dropout rates, exam passing rates, exam marks, and class attendance. Students that followed this active learning approach obtained better results than those that followed a traditional strategy. Besides, the experience of the introduction of such a method in a student subgroup positively influenced the whole group.

A Systematic Review of Developing Team Competencies in Information Systems Education;The ability to work effectively in teams has been a key competence for information systems engineers for a long time. Gradually, more attention is being paid to developing this generic competence as part of academic curricula, resulting in two questions: how to best promote team competencies and how to implement team projects successfully. These questions are closely interwoven and need to be looked at together. To address these questions, this paper identifies relevant studies and approaches, best practices, and key findings in the field of information systems education and related fields such as computer science and business, and examines them together to develop a systematic framework. The framework is intended to categorize existing research on teams and team competencies in information systems education and to guide information systems educators in supporting teamwork and promoting team competencies in students at the course and curricular level in the context of teaching in tertiary education.

Supporting distributed team working in 3D virtual worlds: a case study in Second Life;"Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to report on a study into how a three-dimensional (3D) virtual world (Second Life) can facilitate socialisation and team working among students working on a team project at a distance. This models the situation in many commercial sectors where work is increasingly being conducted across time zones and between multiple teams. Collaboration in these geographically distributed teams is virtual rather than through face-to-face interactions. The paper investigates how a virtual world such as Second Life compares to other collaboration tools such as instant messaging or Skype; and the challenges that students experience in becoming acquainted with and working in Second Life. Design/methodology/approach - The paper has employed a qualitative research methodology involving data collection through group interviews, epistolary (email) interviews and semi-structured individual interviews. The data have been analysed by applying the inductive analysis technique. Findings - The analysis is presented through answers to questions which educators may have about the effectiveness of virtual worlds in supporting collaboration in virtual teams. Research limitations/implications - The paper highlights the pedagogical role of 3D virtual worlds in supporting communication, team working and community building. The methodology will be of interest to researchers in the area of virtual worlds as there is little guidance in the literature about how to evaluate student experiences of these environments. Practical implications - The research reported in this paper is timely and significant in view of current business scenarios such as the challenges of a globally distributed work-place, the need to offer training to develop employees' skills of working in distributed environments and to meet changing market needs. Furthermore, the research will support the development of a coordinated response to the Leitch review of skills in the UK, which identified issues of resource-intensive travel, global warming and the need for businesses to be seen as ""green"" for customer attraction and retention. Originality/value - The paper discusses the role of 3D virtual worlds in supporting student team projects involving students who are geographically dispersed. The sense of visual presence and of place in a 3D world can make socialising in a virtual world, a more ""human"" experience than in 2D environments such as web sites, e-mail, wikis and blogs, and even phone or video-conferencing. The research reported in this paper could enhance uptake of 3D virtual worlds by organisations facing the challenges of facilitating socialisation and knowledge sharing in a distributed workforce.";1012765734;;;Scholarly Journals;;"Minocha, Shailey;Morse, David R";;" Linden Lab

Four requirements for digital case study libraries;  In education, case studies have been employed as a major pedagogical means to engage students with realistic materials and practical problems. The usefulness and success of case studies have been documented in literature. In this paper, we move the case study and its technical affordance a step further toward more authentic or realistic learning and toward communities of practice. Drawing on current intellectual achievement in education, developmental psychology and computer-supported collaborative learning, this paper proposes four requirements for interactive case study libraries, focusing on authentic learning, social interaction, resource accumulation, and communities of practice. With a usability engineering case study library as an example, we discuss design concerns derived from these requirements as well as its use in practice.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT];577636234;;;Scholarly Journals;;"Jiang, Hao;Ganoe, Craig;Carroll, John M";;; Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2010;; 10.1007/s10639-009-9108-x; Feature;;; Sep 2010;;1360-2357;3; English; English;; 219-236; New York;Sep 2010;Education and Information Technologies;;2010;;;15;https://search.proquest.com/docview/577636234?accountid=11774;;;; References;;; 219;; Digital libraries , Educational technology , Computer assisted instruction--CAI , Educational psychology;;;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aeducation&amp;atitle=Four+requirements+for+digital+case+study+libraries&amp;title=Education+and+Information+Technologies&amp;issn=13602357&amp;date=2010-09-01&amp;volume=15&amp;issue=3&amp;spage=219&amp;au=Jiang%2C+Hao%3BGanoe%2C+Craig%3BCarroll%2C+John+M&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=Education+and+Information+Technologies&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/10.1007%2Fs10639-009-9108-x";ProQuest Central,Social Science Premium Collection
Moral conflicts in project-based learning in ISD;"  The purpose of this paper is to increase understanding of moral conflicts in information systems development by studying student perceptions in an information systems (IS) project course implemented in close collaboration with information technology firms. The paper is based on an empirical case study. Students' perceptions of moral conflicts were gathered through diaries, drawings, and questionnaires; and the analysis was inspired by phenomenography. The analysis reveals six types of moral conflicts. Students face conflicts related to their work tasks and to human and outside parties, and inherent in them is an inclination to moral failure in terms of doing something they perceive to be morally wrong, and also the desire for moral success in resolving the conflicts as well as possible. Students practicing the project manager's job confronted the most difficult moral conflicts. The just IS student project community is suggested as a way of integrating ethics into IS education, and extending the research on moral conflicts to the business context is recommended. The paper offers two contributions. First, it develops the research on IS and project-based learning (PjBL) from a moral perspective and second, it facilitates ethics integration into IS education in the PjBL context.";750891082;;;Scholarly Journals;;Vartiainen, Tero;;; Copyright Emerald Group Publishing Limited 2010;; 10.1108/09593841011069167; Feature;;; 2010;;0959-3845;3; English;;; 265-280; West Linn;2010;Information Technology & People;;2010;;;23;https://search.proquest.com/docview/750891082?accountid=11774;; 9175 Western Europe , 9130 Experimental/theoretical , 5240 Software & systems , 2500 Organizational behavior; 9175 Western Europe , 9130 Experimental/theoretical , 5240 Software & systems , 2500 Organizational behavior; References , Photographs , Tables; 9175 Western Europe , 9130 Experimental/theoretical , 5240 Software & systems , 2500 Organizational behavior;; 265; 9175 Western Europe , 9130 Experimental/theoretical , 5240 Software & systems , 2500 Organizational behavior; International , Studies , Information systems , Learning , Ethics , Project management , Group dynamics , Systems development;;;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aabiglobal&amp;atitle=Moral+conflicts+in+project-based+learning+in+ISD&amp;title=Information+Technology+%26+People&amp;issn=09593845&amp;date=2010-07-01&amp;volume=23&amp;issue=3&amp;spage=265&amp;au=Vartiainen%2C+Tero&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=Information+Technology+%26+People&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/10.1108%2F09593841011069167";ProQuest Central,SciTech Premium Collection,Social Science Premium Collection
Impact of Robotics and Geospatial Technology Interventions on Youth STEM Learning and Attitudes;"  This study examined the impact of robotics and geospatial technologies interventions on middle school youth's learning of and attitudes toward science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM). Two interventions were tested. The first was a 40-hour intensive robotics/GPS/GIS summer camp; the second was a 3-hour event modeled on the camp experiences and intended to provide an introduction to these technologies. Results showed that the longer intervention led to significantly greater learning than a control group not receiving the instruction, whereas the short-term intervention primarily impacted youth attitude and motivation. Although the short-term intervention did not have the learning advantages of a more intensive robotics camp, it can serve a key role in getting youth excited about technology and encouraging them to seek out additional opportunities to explore topics in greater detail, which can result in improved learning.

Evaluation Of A Student Team Project In An Introduction To Software Engineering Course For Aerospace Engineers;Software engineering plays an important role in many industries, especially aerospace where the aircraft, spacecraft, and ground systems are often very large and complex, and safety and/or the mission require very safe software. In order to prepare aerospace engineering students to be more competitive in the aerospace workforce, Introduction to Software Engineering was developed at a the Pennsylvania State University in 2007. This senior-level course was designed to present software engineering concepts to aerospace students who have some background in computer programming, but no prior knowledge in software engineering. Students majoring in aerospace can select the software engineering course or an electrical engineering course as a requirement for the aerospace major in the eighth semester. In addition students can also take the course as an aerospace engineering elective or to fulfill requirements for minors in computational science or information science and technology. During the first two years, the course provided the materials based solely on lectures and talks from guest speakers. To provide a more real-world experience to students, a student team project was added to the course in the spring semester 2009, where they had to use the software engineering concepts. The pedagogical approach was to incorporate peer learning through teamwork that would involve the students in a problem-based learning experience. The team project was designed with three objectives: to provide hands-on experience in software engineering through the development of a relatively small software system, to simulate the real working environment in a large company by having the students in the class work together as a team, and to emphasize the communication and collaboration skills among small groups in the software development model which are crucial skills in developing large and complex software systems. The purpose of this paper is to describe the student team project including a discussion of how it improved the learning experiences of students and to share assessment data of student perceptions of working on a team. Preliminary findings indicate that participation in the team project increased the students’ awareness of the importance of software engineering in the Aerospace industry. Individuals who are involved in the design and development of real world projects in software engineering courses and pedagogy may be interested in this paper. The need for software engineering education is important to the economy. The number of software disasters is growing1. Millions of dollars are spent on software disasters each year and this will grow as software systems become more complex. The Aerospace Department at the Pennsylvania State University recognized the importance of enhancing the curriculum to support the needs of current aerospace systems. Recruiters tell us that their companies are interested in hiring aerospace graduates that have studied software engineering or systems engineering1.

Characteristics of learning computer-controlled mechanisms by teachers and students in a common laboratory environment;  Growing popularity of robotics education motivates developing its didactics and studying it in teacher training programs. This paper presents a study conducted in the Department of Education in Technology and Science, Technion, in which university students and school pupils cope with robotics challenges of designing, building and operating computer-controlled mechanisms. The university students were involved in developing robot prototypes and related instructional materials, and assisted in teaching robotics and guiding projects to middle school and high school pupils. The study focused on behaviors of the two groups of learners and aimed to elicit and analyze typical characteristics of learning in the developed robotics environment. We collected qualitative data on learning through robot design and experimentation activities and, by means of the ground theory method, elicited and analyzed typical behavioral characteristics of students' and pupils' learning: self-confidence, help, collaboration, interest, seriousness, self-dependence, learning effort, responsibility, coping with learning pressure, learning through observation, and perseverance. As found, the behavior characteristics evolve in the course of robotics studies and their evolution can give indication on the development of the desired competences.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT];221234935;;;Scholarly Journals;;"Korchnoy, Evgeny;Verner, Igor M";;; Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2010;; 10.1007/s10798-008-9071-7; Feature;;; May 2010;;0957-7572;2; English; English;; 217-237; Dordrecht;May 2010;International Journal of Technology and Design Education;;2010;;;20;https://search.proquest.com/docview/221234935?accountid=11774;;;; References;;; 217;; Experiential learning , Robots , Technology education , Student behavior;;;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aeducation&amp;atitle=Characteristics+of+learning+computer-controlled+mechanisms+by+teachers+and+students+in+a+common+laboratory+environment&amp;title=International+Journal+of+Technology+and+Design+Education&amp;issn=09577572&amp;date=2010-05-01&amp;volume=20&amp;issue=2&amp;spage=217&amp;au=Korchnoy%2C+Evgeny%3BVerner%2C+Igor+M&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=International+Journal+of+Technology+and+Design+Education&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/10.1007%2Fs10798-008-9071-7";Art, Design & Architecture Collection,ProQuest Central,SciTech Premium Collection,Social Science Premium Collection
Towards Greater Learner Control: Web Supported Project-Based Learning;Project-based learning has been suggested as an appropriate pedagogy to prepare students in information systems for the realities of the business world. Web-based resources have been used to support such pedagogy with mixed results. The paper argues that the design of web-based learning support to cater to different learning styles may give students more control over the learning process. A case study approach was used to analyse an undergraduate information systems class in a French business school. The results show that while students generally believe they attained the class learning objectives, they react very differently to this pedagogy.

A checklist for integrating student empirical studies with research and teaching goals;The use of empirical studies with students in software engineering helps researchers gain insight into new or existing techniques and methods. However, due mainly to concerns of external validity, questions have been raised about the value of these types of studies. The authors of this paper draw on their experiences of conducting a large number of empirical studies in university courses in three countries (Italy, Norway, and the United States) to address this important issue. This paper first identifies the requirements that research and pedagogy place on a valid empirical study with students. This information is then used as the basis for a checklist that provides guidance for researchers and educators when planning and conducting studies in university courses. The goal of this checklist is to help ensure that these studies have as much research and pedagogical value as possible. Finally, an example application of the checklist is provided to illustrate its use.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT];871514989;;;Scholarly Journals;;"Carver, Jeffrey C;Jaccheri, Letizia;Morasca, Sandro;Shull, Forrest";;; Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2010;; 10.1007/s10664-009-9109-9; Feature;;; Feb 2010;;1382-3256;1; English; English;; 35-59; Dordrecht;Feb 2010;Empirical Software Engineering;;2010;;;15;https://search.proquest.com/docview/871514989?accountid=11774;;;;;;; 35;;;;;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Ahightechjournals&amp;atitle=A+checklist+for+integrating+student+empirical+studies+with+research+and+teaching+goals&amp;title=Empirical+Software+Engineering&amp;issn=13823256&amp;date=2010-02-01&amp;volume=15&amp;issue=1&amp;spage=35&amp;au=Carver%2C+Jeffrey+C%3BJaccheri%2C+Letizia%3BMorasca%2C+Sandro%3BShull%2C+Forrest&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=Empirical+Software+Engineering&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/10.1007%2Fs10664-009-9109-9";ProQuest Central,SciTech Premium Collection
Supporting Distributed Team Working in 3D Virtual Worlds: A Case Study in Second Life;"Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to report on a study into how a three-dimensional (3D) virtual world (Second Life) can facilitate socialisation and team working among students working on a team project at a distance. This models the situation in many commercial sectors where work is increasingly being conducted across time zones and between multiple teams. Collaboration in these geographically distributed teams is virtual rather than through face-to-face interactions. The paper investigates how a virtual world such as Second Life compares to other collaboration tools such as instant messaging or Skype; and the challenges that students experience in becoming acquainted with and working in Second Life. Design/methodology/approach: The paper has employed a qualitative research methodology involving data collection through group interviews, epistolary (email) interviews and semi-structured individual interviews. The data have been analysed by applying the inductive analysis technique. Findings: The analysis is presented through answers to questions which educators may have about the effectiveness of virtual worlds in supporting collaboration in virtual teams. Research limitations/implications: The paper highlights the pedagogical role of 3D virtual worlds in supporting communication, team working and community building. The methodology will be of interest to researchers in the area of virtual worlds as there is little guidance in the literature about how to evaluate student experiences of these environments. Practical implications: The research reported in this paper is timely and significant in view of current business scenarios such as the challenges of a globally distributed work-place, the need to offer training to develop employees' skills of working in distributed environments and to meet changing market needs. Furthermore, the research will support the development of a coordinated response to the Leitch review of skills in the UK, which identified issues of resource-intensive travel, global warming and the need for businesses to be seen as ""green"" for customer attraction and retention. Originality/value: The paper discusses the role of 3D virtual worlds in supporting student team projects involving students who are geographically dispersed. The sense of visual presence and of place in a 3D world can make socialising in a virtual world, a more ""human"" experience than in 2D environments such as web sites, e-mail, wikis and blogs, and even phone or video-conferencing. The research reported in this paper could enhance uptake of 3D virtual worlds by organisations facing the challenges of facilitating socialisation and knowledge sharing in a distributed workforce.

Perceptions of change in teaching styles during a one-to-one laptop initiative;The primary purpose of this study is to provide solid quantitative data demonstrating how teachers are perceived to change in a one-to-one laptop environment, both as a whole and by subject area, during a laptop initiative that includes significant investments in professional development. The main research question is Do teachers change their basic pedagogy, or teaching practices, based on their participation in a laptop initiative? Four null Hypotheses were investigated: (1) Teacher pedagogy (as measured on a scale from didactic to constructivist) will not change due to participation in a statewide laptop initiative, (2) Teachers of different subjects will exhibit similar patterns in terms of the didactic or constructivist nature of their teaching styles at the beginning of the CFF program, (3) Teachers of different subjects will be equally likely to change along the spectrum from didactic to constructivist as a result of the CFF laptop initiative, (4) Teachers with different amounts of teaching experience will be equally likely to change their teaching styles due to their participation in a laptop initiative. This dissertation looks at three data sources, a teacher survey and student survey, and classroom observation data. Findings show that the first hypothesis is indeed rejected in that teachers are perceived to show significant changes in their teaching styles. The second hypothesis looked at descriptive survey results at the beginning of the program, which indicated that there are different perceived patterns in the nature of the different subjects teaching styles so the hypothesis is rejected. The findings for the third hypothesis show that teachers of different subject areas are perceived to change the way they teach, in different ways in a one-to-one laptop initiative. The fourth hypothesis found a few statistically significant perceived changes in the ways teachers teach while part of a one-to-one laptop initiative.;854047842;;;Dissertations & Theses;;Sprenger, Karl Russell;;;" Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.";;; Dissertation/Thesis;;; 2010; 978-1-124-48789-2;;; English; English;;;;2010;ProQuest Dissertations and Theses;;2010;;;;https://search.proquest.com/docview/854047842?accountid=11774;; 0533 Secondary education , 0710 Educational technology; 0533 Secondary education , 0710 Educational technology;; 0533 Secondary education , 0710 Educational technology;;; 0533 Secondary education , 0710 Educational technology; Secondary education , Educational technology , Perceptions , Teaching methods , Portable computers; Education , Laptop initiative , One-to-one laptop , Teaching style;;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:Education+Database&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Perceptions+of+change+in+teaching+styles+during+a+one-to-one+laptop+initiative&amp;issn=&amp;date=2010-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Sprenger%2C+Karl+Russell&amp;isbn=978-1-124-48789-2&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/";ProQuest Central,Social Science Premium Collection
The Trend toward Online Project-Oriented Capstone Courses;At Pace University we have been using real-world student projects in capstone computing courses for about 10 years. While the courses were conducted in a traditional classroom environment during the early years, the current course has been essentially online for the last five years in order to reach a greater number of geographically scattered students. Findings indicate that appropriate team management changes can smooth the transition from co-located to distributed teams, and that peer evaluations and other remote assessment techniques make it possible to assess the work of students on distributed teams.

Team Learning in Technology-Mediated Distributed Teams;This study examines technological, educational/learning, and social affordances associated with the facilitation of project-based learning and problem solving in technology-mediated distributed teams. An empirical interpretive research approach using direct observation is used to interpret, evaluate and rate observable manifested behaviors and qualitative content (i.e. discussions) associated with project-based team learning. The theory of affordances and social impact theory are integrated to develop a conceptual model that asserts that collaboration mode (collocated vs. non-collocated and videoconferencing supported) will dictate the quality of information exchange, progressive elaboration of ideas, and the social processes that influence team learning. Team learning is then suggested to yield better productivity and higher perceived interaction quality. Results showed that collaboration mode can impact team information exchange and interpretation and ultimately task outcomes. Further, collaboration mode can also create a social structure that influences the capacity for a team to maintain a mutual supportive and positive climate needed for successful project-based task outcomes. The results offer some extended insights into the technology-mediated collaborative learning process among students in a higher education context as well as in organizational settings. Theoretical, methodological and practical implications of the study are discussed.

Making Sense of Software Development and Personality Types;It's common sense to state that the production of any software product involves a human element, at least to some extent. We all have different personality traits, and the way we perceive, plan, and execute any activity is influenced by these characteristics. Typically, software development is a product of teamwork, involving several people performing various tasks. The success and failure of software projects reveal the human factor as one of vital importance. Not everyone can excel at every task, thus better results are achieved if people with particular personality traits are assigned to different aspects of a project, especially the roles best suited to their ability. The authors mapped some opposing psychological traits, such as extroversion-introversion, sensing-intuition, thinking-feeling, and judging-perceiving, to the main stages of a software development life cycle.
