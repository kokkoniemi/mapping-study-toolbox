Engineering educators are expected to produce employable engineers that suit perfectly to each industry's needs. To accommodate to these demands; problem oriented project-based learning (PBL) based on industrial engineering problems are incorporated in the individual final year projects for mechanical engineering undergraduate students in Universiti Teknologi Mara Malaysia. This paper discusses the findings based on 13 students centered individual industrial projects with eight companies from 2015 to 2016. The objectives of this paper is to discuss the impact of individual industrial PBL based on the correlation between the results obtained from the individual industrial based projects with feedback from the industries and the students. 5point Likert Scale Surveys were administered to 13 students who had graduated and currently employed in obtaining students' perceptions on the 13 outcomes that should be gained throughout the industry oriented final year projects. The initial findings discovered that all the students obtained excellent grades and received positive feedbacks from the eight companies involved. This paper discusses individual industrial PBL; outcomes obtained through the industry oriented final year engineering projects; its benefits and potential in engineering education especially in improving the students competency; autonomy; relatedness as well as academic engagement. Nevertheless; there are challenges faced by engineering educators in making the quantum leap especially in more academic engagement with industries.";"";"978-1-5386-1523-2";"10.1109/WEEF.2017.8467149";"";"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8467149";"Project-based learning;Problem-based learning;Engineering education;Industries";"Industries;Companies;Engineering education;Mechanical engineering;Automotive engineering;Australia;Reliability";"computer aided instruction;computer science education;educational institutions;engineering education;further education";"industrial based final year engineering projects;engineering education programs;competence engineers;mechanical engineering undergraduate students;individual industrial PBL;students competency;problem oriented project-based learning;Universiti Teknologi Mara Malaysia;5point Likert Scale Surveys";"";"1";"9";"";"";"";"";"IEEE";"IEEE Conferences"

A case is a text that describes a real life situation providing information but not solution. Previous research shows that case-based teaching helps students to apply the principles discussed in the class for solving complex practical problems. We divide one main project into sub-projects to give to students in order to enhance their practical experience of designing a compiler. To measure the effectiveness of case-based discussions; students complete a survey on their perceptions of benefits of case-based learning. The survey is analyzed using frequency distribution and chi square test of association. The results of the survey show that case-based teaching of compiler concepts does enhance students skills of learning; critical thinking; engagement; communication skills and team work.";"";"978-1-5090-6115-0";"10.1109/T4E.2016.052";"";"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7814827";"Case-Based Learning;Cognitive Apprenticeship Model;Constructivism;Didactic Teaching;Problem-Based Learning;Project-Based Learning;Teaching Compiler Design.";"Education;Grammar;Robot sensing systems;Program processors;Mathematical model;Syntactics";"assembly language;computer science education;educational courses;high level languages;program compilers;teaching";"compiler design concept course;project-based learning;programming language compilers;high level programming language;low level assembly language;B.Tech third year students;Delhi University;case-based discussions;case-based learning;frequency distribution;chi square test;case-based teaching;critical thinking;communication skills;team work";"";"4";"13";"";"";"";"";"IEEE";"IEEE Conferences"

To confront this challenge; in previous years; we have included a project-based learning phase at the end of our course to encourage the acquisition of high level design and creativity. To address some of the shortcomings of our previous editions; we have recently included a mastery phase to the course. While project-based learning is suitable for teaching high-level skills that require design and creativity and prepare the students for the study of software engineering; mastery-based learning is suitable for concrete skills such as basic programming tasks. Our particular innovation is to allow students into the project phase only if they have demonstrated a minimum predefined competency level in programming.

Twenty-two teachers participated in the workshop. Instructors of the workshop were faculty members from West Virginia University Institute of Technology; West Virginia University; and West Virginia State University. The workshop's focus was project-based learning; which employs projects closely related to real-world applications to facilitate delivering abstract concepts. Specifically during the workshop; the participating high school math teachers learned designing engineering projects; mapping engineering projects to Next Generation math standards/objectives; and assessing the outcomes of project-based learning. Each participating teacher is required to implement at least one engineering project in his/her math class and the results will be collected by the superintendents of the three participating school districts. The workshop has two primary hypotheses: (i) teachers who participated in the workshop will increase their self-efficacy toward implementing project-based learning; applying engineering and technology to address content standards and objectives; and using assessments to inform instruction; and (ii) project-based learning will improve students' self-efficacy and learning effectiveness in math; and in turn; will increase their interest/intention to pursue STEM disciplines. The impact of the workshop on teachers is determined through surveys and interviews. Social Cognitive Career Theory is applied to evaluate the impact of project-based learning on the participating teachers' students.

Background: Studies find that men and women report taking on different roles in PBL projects; and that there is a relationship between team gender breakdown and students' satisfaction with PBL teams; with teams less happy with the inclusion of more women. Both male and female students on teams with two or more women report lower team satisfaction than men on teams of just men; or men and women on teams with a single woman Research Questions: How do students self-select; negotiate; and allocate tasks on PBL teams? How does past PBL experience influence task allocation? How does gender affect task allocation? Methodology: First-year students (N = 60) completed reflections about task assignment during a semester-long PBL experience. Findings: Individual student characteristics that are related to gender - including interests; skills; experiences; and self-efficacy - interact with students' goal orientations to lead to individual preferences regarding tasks.

Additionally; the POPBL framework consists of three stages: onset; execution and closure stages that are sequentially organized directly from planning; analysis; designing and implementation phases in software development. The designed POPBL framework is experimented and integrated into two relevant SE courses namely Programming Technique 1 (PT1) and System Analysis and Design (SAD). The instructors and learners' responses/feedbacks gathered from the survey are positive and promising. In overall; most of the learners agreed that the POPBL implementation in the taught courses improved their non-technical (communication; leader/peers with team working and planning) and their technical skills to creatively solve the real-world problems of the given application systems for the case study projects. From the instructor's point of view; adopting POPBL approach in T&L demands immense work; timely preparation and great participation especially in monitoring the team progress; as well as in giving fast feedbacks and suggestion for every submitted deliverables.";"";"978-1-4799-5439-1";"10.1109/MySec.2014.6986044";"";"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6986044";"Project-Oriented Problem-Based Learning (POPBL);Teaching and Learning (T&L);Software Engineering (SE);Software Development Life-Cycles (SDLC)";"Software;Planning;Programming;Education;Testing;Software engineering;Monitoring";"computer science education;educational courses;planning;programming;software engineering;systems analysis;teaching";"generic framework design;software engineering courses;project-oriented problem-based learning approach;POPBL approach;teaching and learning environment;T&L environment;SE courses;students personal abilities development;cognitive learning;collaborative approach;content approach;onset stage;execution stage;closure stage;planning phase;analysis phase;designing phase;implementation phase;software development;programming technique 1;PT1;system analysis and design;SAD;nontechnical skills;team progress monitoring";"";"1";"16";"";"";"";"";"IEEE";"IEEE Conferences"

This paper presents experiences with developing and using a peer assessment framework that provides a 360-degree view on students' project performance.

Most computational tools solve the group assignment problem (GAP) by assigning students to relevant groups based on some general criterion.

The system needs to have more or less same strength with the presence of all the skills required to complete the project.

It remains a challenge to develop effective techniques for teaching parallel programing skills. Another challenge is finding time within already packed lectures to cover additional material. To that end; we investigate the effectiveness of using Project Based Learning (PBL) to teach parallel programming skills early in the curriculum by developing and incorporating a PBL module into CSc 3210 (Computer Organization and Programming). This is a core course taken by all computer science majors and is a prerequisite to many of our senior-level classes. In our case study; 124 students are organized into 26 diverse groups; with four or five students per group; and assigned five project assignments; each of two-weeks duration. Given a Raspberry PI; students will explore its multicore architecture and create programs for shared memory parallelism using OpenMP and C language. Our results show that incorporating this PBL module has a significant and direct effect on the student's growth in parallel programming skills. As a side benefit; we also show that there is a direct improvement on a student's personal growth in terms soft skills; which is essential in the professional development and success in the workplace. By having students experience PBL in an early class; close to the midpoint of the academic program; it can serve as a mini-capstone project. Furthermore; students can collaboratively learn by themselves (through teamwork) and apply the fundamentals of parallel programming skills without the need for separate lectures; labs; or workshops.";"";"978-1-7281-3510-6";"10.1109/IPDPSW.2019.00059";"";"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8778328";"Parallel Computing;Parallel Programming;OpenMP;Shared Memory;Project Based Learning;Raspberry PI;Soft Skills;Teamwork Technology";"Parallel programming;Teamwork;Parallel processing;Multicore processing";"C language;computer aided instruction;computer science education;educational courses;message passing;parallel programming;programming languages;public domain software;teaching";"C language;OpenMP;shared memory parallelism;multicore architecture;Raspberry PI;Raspberry PI;computer organization and programming;CSc 3210;PBL;parallel programming skill teaching;soft skills;project based learning";"";"";"18";"";"";"";"";"IEEE";"IEEE Conferences"

Recently; the authors of this paper have developed a domain-specific modeling language approach and an associated web-based PBL application to support the development and delivery of online PBL modules in a cost-effective and flexible manner. In this paper; the authors emphasize to support peer assessment in an online PBL. Through using a peer assessment example; the authors present how to support teachers; who may not have a comprehensive technical knowledge; to specify a peer assessment process as a segment of a PBL script; a graphical representation of a PBL strategy. Then the PBL application can transform a PBL script that including the peer assessment into a formal model represented in an international e-learning technical standard IMS-Learning Design (IMS-LD).

PBL involves team formation where necessary skills are needed to execute the project. Traditionally; the teams were randomly allocated based on individual preferences. To cab on this issue; preference based model needs few refinements such as skills needs to be identified by the facilitator while the students provide the necessary skill data. This way; students get assigned based on their skill rather than just random allocation. In a worst case scenario for random allocation; a team can end up with a very strong team having high skills or vice versa where a team has all of its members with limited skill or few skills are missing. The group created by skill preference would allow each group to more or less have the same strength and nearly all skills would be present in a group. In this paper; a method is extended from its original to cater for other state-of-the-art optimization techniques rather than just genetic algorithm to find a method that can suit small or large dataset. The objective function takes into account the differences between the total skill set of each group with the average total skill set needed for each group and the missing skill penalty of each group is added. Missing skill penalty is incurred due to not satisfying all the constraints such as non-presence of all the skills in a group. The skill rating allows better selection of members in a software engineering course. The results discussed in this paper are from 5 courses of one university.";"";"978-1-7281-2153-6";"10.1109/CEC.2019.8789987";"";"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8789987";"Project Based Learning;particle swarm optimization;genetic algorithm;skill based;invasive weed optimization;firefly algorithm";"Optimization;Resource management;Sociology;Statistics;Education;Mathematical model;Partitioning algorithms";"computer aided instruction;computer science education;educational courses;educational institutions;genetic algorithms;software engineering";"practical based assessment;preference based model;random allocation;skill preference;total skill set;missing skill penalty;skill rating;skill based group allocation;meta-heuristic approaches;project based learning courses;students;skill data;software engineering course;optimization technique;genetic algorithm;university";"";"";"29";"";"";"";"";"IEEE";"IEEE Conferences"

Centered in a real-world application; a cochlear implant; the exercise challenged students to demonstrate a working software-based signal processor. Partnering in groups of two or three; second-year electrical and computer engineering and biomedical engineering students used MATLAB graphical user interface programs; complemented with their own original MATLAB code; to design filters suitable for achieving a filter bank decomposition of an audio signal. Rather than using the envelope-detected output for direct electrical stimulation of auditory nerve fibers as in an implant; the students reconstructed the signal by modulating sinusoids to yield an acoustic simulation. To appreciate the impact of filter order on sound intelligibility; students were asked to reconstruct signals using 4-16 filter channels for both speech and music and to examine the results critically. The lab served as a substrate upon which to solidify fundamental signal processing concepts such as the distinction between time and frequency domains; constructing and interpreting spectrograms; sampling; spectral decomposition; filtering; and reconstruction. In the spirit of PBL; the students examined engineering tradeoffs and discussed implementations when they were asked to consider realizing a significantly higher channel count (128-channel) device. To determine how the laboratory exercise impacted student learning and comprehension; as well as the level of student engagement achieved with this compelling application; an anonymous online survey was administered at the end of the course.

The use of such tools may contribute to the development of both technical knowledge of students and of soft skills. For this case study; the results show that the students considered the computer tools useful in promoting and facilitating the construction of knowledge and in developing several competencies; i.e.; in developing their learning processes.

The presence of several PBL flavors and models added more complexity to the development process preventing any single environment from being unanimously recognized by the PBL community. In this paper; we review and discuss the implementation approaches that were used in developing PBL environments in the open-source LMS Moodle.

We go over a wide range of PBL implementations starting from the basic ones that used whatever features available without adding any new functionality. We then browse two Moodle environments that implemented a particular PBL model.

To encourage these senior students to become active learners; effective engineering communicators; and to possess the problem solving skill in the field of control system technology amenable to the manufacturing sector; the PBL has been integrated into this course. Specifically; the assignment of constructing a physical demo; or so-called the mini-project with the programmable logic controller (PLC) was used to evaluate the effectiveness of the PBL. The mini-project was established as an open-ended task. Students were allowed to propose their ideas for creating the prototypes; i.e.; the minimal viable products (MVPs). The PBL assignment was evaluated against a pre-defined scoring rubric. This new course structure has been applied for two semesters in the academic year of 2017. The students' grades; and the assessment of rubrics' criteria of the mini-project were used to compare with the students' grades in the 2016 academic year (with a traditional learning approach).

Krishnan";"Wentworth Institute of Technology; Boston; MA 02115 USA";"2011 Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society";"";"2011";"";"";"6518";"6521";"Training biomedical engineers while effectively keeping up with the fast paced scientific breakthroughs and the growth in technical innovations poses arduous challenges for educators. Traditional pedagogical methods are employed for coping with the increasing demands in biomedical engineering (BME) training and continuous improvements have been attempted with some success. Project-based learning (PBL) is an academic effort that challenges students by making them carry out interdisciplinary projects aimed at accomplishing a wide range of student learning outcomes. PBL has been shown to be effective in the medical field and has been adopted by other fields including engineering. The impact of globalization in healthcare appears to be steadily increasing which necessitates the inclusion of awareness of relevant international activities in the curriculum. Numerous difficulties are encountered when the formation of a collaborative team is tried; and additional difficulties occur as the collaboration team is extended to international partners. Understanding and agreement of responsibilities becomes somewhat complex and hence the collaborative project has to be planned and executed with clear understanding by all partners and participants. A model for training BME students by adopting PBL with international collaboration is proposed. The results of previous BME project work with international collaboration fit partially into the model. There were many logistic issues and constraints; however; the collaborative projects themselves greatly enhanced the student learning outcomes. This PBL type of learning experience tends to promote long term retention of multidisciplinary material and foster high-order cognitive activities such as analysis; synthesis and evaluation. In addition to introducing the students to experiences encountered in the real-life workforce; the proposed approach enhances developing professional contracts and global networking. In conclusion; despite initial challenges; adopting project-based learning with international collaboration has strong potentials to be valuable in the training of biomedical engineering students.";"1558-4615";"978-1-4577-1589-1";"10.1109/IEMBS.2011.6091608";"";"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6091608";"project-based learning;biomedical project;international collaboration";"Collaboration;Biomedical engineering;International collaboration;Training;Industries;Educational institutions;Medical services";"biomedical engineering;health care;learning (artificial intelligence);medical computing;physiological models";"project-based learning;fast paced scientific breakthroughs;traditional pedagogical methods;biomedical engineering training;interdisciplinary projects;healthcare;multidisciplinary material;foster high-order cognitive activities;real-life workforce;professional contracts;global networking";"Biomedical Engineering;Biomedical Engineering;Career Choice;Curriculum;Education; Graduate;Humans;Interdisciplinary Communication;International Cooperation;Learning;Program Development;Research Design";"2";"9";"";"";"";"";"IEEE";"IEEE Conferences"

Moreover; even if courses such as Management and Entrepreneurship are part of the curriculum; students view these subjects uninteresting due to a lack of practical component [1]. Young people need the opportunity to sharpen their skills so that they can quickly join the job market [2]. This paper describes an altered version of the Project Based Learning method (PBL); as a suggestion for developing entrepreneurship skill to students; based on their ideas and interests. The proposed method was used in two educational projects implemented by Applied Informatics in Business and Economy students. The assessment of hard and soft skills development was performed through written tests; interviews and 360 degrees feedback from the participants. The final results were very promising; depicting that 80% of the participants made it through the program successfully. Moreover; they felt confident enough for their knowledge and capable to start their own business. An interesting finding was that 40% of the students were already building a team to start developing their own product. They all believed that their entrepreneurial skills were developed. In addition to that; written tests showed that their hard skills have also been enhanced. Even though the economic environment of Greece is aggressive to entrepreneurship [3]; a year after the projects were concluded; 20% of the participants were still trying to build their own business by developing their own product. It is the first time; to the best of the authors' knowledge; that technology and informatics are used as means to enhance entrepreneurship in Greece; starting from concept and ending to the actual promotion of an actual product (prototype).";"2165-9567";"978-1-5090-5467-1";"10.1109/EDUCON.2017.7942872";"";"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7942872";"Entrepreneurship;Soft skill developement;Project Based Learning";"Entrepreneurship;Education;Learning systems;Informatics;Europe;Prototypes";"business data processing;educational technology";"young technology entrepreneurship enhancement;technology-oriented curriculum;knowledge background;business minded orientation;project based learning method;PBL;applied informatics;economy students;business students;soft skills development;entrepreneurial skills;economic environment;Greece";"";"";"19";"";"";"";"";"IEEE";"IEEE Conferences"

PBL has also been employed across a wide range of disciplines and areas in education primarily medical; engineering; and business. The pedagogy that has been practiced for decades using the traditional face-to-face activities largely benefited from all the online technologies in empowering the learners in a non-classical structure. Computer technologies were exploited by researcher and educators at different capacities in order to add a value to PBL. Online implementations ranged from using basic communication tools to building fully-fledged systems and websites. Several research projects succeeded in building comprehensive; feature-rich; PBL-tailored learning environments. On the other hand; some implementation were either partially useful or inherently deficient. Although many attempts achieved attractive results; they either ended up unused or unsupported by the institution. The reasons in many cases were purely technical and not related to the suitability of the environment to the pedagogy. This paper describes the need; design; and implementation of a conceptual model to allow students to effectively collaborate using a customizable framework for PBL courses. In this paper; we present ePBL ; an online environment for PBL suitable for educational institutions at any level.

This is not always recommended in initial software engineering project courses; however; where novice developers run projects in teams while simultaneously taking other courses. To enhance the learning and teamwork experience in this latter instructional scenario; this paper proposes a formative monitoring method; reflexive weekly monitoring (RWM); for use in project courses that involve disciplined software processes and loosely coupled work. RWM uses self-reflection and collaborative learning practices to help students be aware of their individual and team performance. RWM was applied in a case study over nine consecutive semesters. The results obtained indicate that RWM was effective in enhancing the learning experience in the instructional scenario studied.

The Computer Engineering undergraduate program at UEFS adopts PBL since 2003. Previous studies thoroughly describe PBL course design and practices; but there is a lack of reports about the teaching experience; i.e.; how faculty live the process of teaching PBL courses. Thus; we took advantage of this PBL experience to uncover such issues. We developed an interpretative phenomenological analysis (IPA) to learn the essences of being a PBL teacher; using a qualitative research methodology. Data collection and analysis entailed semi-structured interviews with five UEFS computer engineering professors; interview transcription and memo writing; open coding; code memo writing; code grouping and abstraction; and description of essences. Results led to the following essences: 1) feedback is essential for student success; 2) PBL develops better students and professionals; 3) assessment is complex and multifaceted; 4) developing good problems is a difficult skill; 5) PBL requires strong teacher engagement and background; 6) it is essential to keep a motivating scenario; and 7) good coordination and group dynamics is required.

Complex engineering projects are usually carried out by the assimilation of different work teams; which could even be located geographically distant. Collaborative Web environments are proven to be ideal knowledge repositories; as it has seen in Academia and in Industry. The work here presented reproduces the organization of actual engineering projects; and brings it into the classroom. This new way of developing Project Work documentation and discussion has helped students become self-directed learners who internalize specific topics from different subjects; programmes and courses with their own interests; and has been considered as an easy alternative to promote active learning; not only in this area but in other courses. Project were launched in the engineering disciplines; each offering possibilities for the application of specific skills in the following courses: TEC -Manufacturing Technology-; CAD -Computer Aided Design-; SIM -Simulation in Mechanical Engineering-; and FAB -Fabrication / Manufacturing. TEC and SIM are applied in the Mechanical Engineering programme at ETSII; while FAB is part of the Industrial Engineering programme; finally CAD is voluntarily employed by students in different semesters and programmes. The new approach is oriented towards inducing collaboration within multidisciplinary teams. This paper describes the experience of collaboration among students and teachers in order to develop multidisciplinary projects; and to reproduce as closely as possible; the team's integration into a company environment. A new methodology based on student interaction and content development in a Wiki environment has been developed. The collaborative server has allowed creating an “out-of-the-classroom” active discussion forum for students of different teams /topics; and to compile an important “project work” portfolio. This experience has been very satisfactory for students and teachers; who have participated with enthusiasm due to the exit of the well-distributed work and the easiness of use of the selected platform (Wiki). The quality of the developed projects has been dramatically improved due to the integration of the results provided by the different teams.";"2165-9567";"978-1-4244-6571-2";"10.1109/EDUCON.2010.5492508";"";"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5492508";"Project Based Learning;Active Learning;Collaborative Work;Multidisciplinary Approach;Wiki Environment;Teaching Mechanical Engineering";"Mechanical engineering;Design engineering;Industrial engineering;Knowledge engineering;Collaborative work;Design automation;Collaboration;Process design;Manufacturing processes;Product design";"computer aided instruction;design engineering;educational courses;educational institutions;engineering education;industrial engineering;Internet;mechanical engineering;mechanical engineering computing;product design";"multidisciplinary project based learning;mechanical engineering students;industrial engineering students;Higher Technical School of Industrial Engineering;Technical University of Madrid;mechanical design;manufacturing processes;product design;multidisciplinary engineering teams;collaborative Web environments;project work documentation;active learning;TEC course;manufacturing technology course;CAD course;computer aided design course;simulation in mechanical engineering course;fabrication course;student interaction;content development;Wiki environment;collaborative server;out-of-the-classroom active discussion forum;project work portfolio";"";"14";"11";"";"";"";"";"IEEE";"IEEE Conferences"

We use the Five Factors and Stress (FFS) theory and the modified grounded theory approach (M-GTA) to measure the personal characteristics and to identify the learning process of each team member. Additionally; we compare the learning process of a team with a high educational effectiveness to one with a low educational effectiveness based on number of topics about the learning process and the kind of topics. As a result; we find that it is better for a team to have members with different personal characteristic as defined by FFS theory in order for the students to acquire more knowledge and skills through the course.

Unlike other branches of engineering; the engineering processes are not visible here. Further; management of large number of student projects poses a challenge in terms of guidance; progress monitoring and assessment. The student projects are observed to be ending up incomplete and are rarely deployed. The feedback from industry side also speaks about the gaps in terms of these skills. A mini project course for fifth semester is designed in the undergraduate programme in Computer Science and Engineering to address the lacunae observed above by tightly integrating it with the theory course on Software engineering. The focus of the mini project is not on what the problem definition is; instead it is on how it is done. The implementation plan addressed the issues and challenges listed above faced by the faculty. Assessment rubrics are written to guarantee proper understanding of the expectations among the stake holders resulting in fair assessment.

Specifically; we use the Random Forest (RF) machine learning (ML) method to predict the effectiveness of software engineering teamwork learning based on data collected during student team project development. These data include over 100 objective and quantitative Team Activity Measures (TAM) obtained from monitoring and measuring activities of student teams during the creation of their final class project in our joint software engineering classes which ran concurrently at San Francisco State University (SFSU); Fulda University (Fulda) and Florida Atlantic University (FAU). In this paper we provide the first RF analysis results done at SFSU on our full data set covering four years of our joint SE classes. These data include 74 student teams with over 380 students; totaling over 30000 discrete data points. These data are grouped into 11 time intervals; each measuring important phases of project development during the class (e.g. early requirement gathering and design; development; testing and delivery). We briefly elaborate on the methods of data collection and describe the data itself. We then show prediction results of the RF analysis applied to this full data set. Results show that we are able to detect student teams who are bound to fail or need attention in early class time with good (about 70%) accuracy. Moreover; the variable importance analysis shows that the features (TAM measures) with high predictive power make intuitive sense; such as late delivery/late responses; time used to help each other; and surprisingly statistics on commit messages to the code repository; etc. In summary; we believe we demonstrate the viability of using ML on objective and quantitative team activity measures to predict student learning of software engineering teamwork; and point to easy-to-measure factors that can be used to guide educators and software engineering managers to implement early intervention for teams bound to fail.

There have been some attempts to transfer studio-based teaching to software engineering education. In many ways; this is natural as software engineering has significant practical elements. However; attempts at software studios have usually ignored experiences and theory from arts and design studio teaching. There is therefore a lack of understanding of what ""studio"" really means; how well the concepts transfer to software engineering; and how effective studios are in practice. Without a clear definition of ""studio""; software studios cannot be properly evaluated for their impact on student learning nor can best and worst practices be shared between those who run studios. In this paper; we address this problem head-on by conducting a qualitative analysis of what ""studio"" really means in both arts and design. We carried out 15 interviews with a range of people with studio experiences and present an analysis and model for evaluation here. Our results suggest that there are many intertwined aspects that define studio education; but it is primarily the people and the culture that make a studio.

Students in lower level courses; with assistance of instructor; then analyze the projects specifications; designs; and implementations; and find out about the principles and specific details of software development on a real case study; which is available at hand. Then; depending on each project's scope; an instructor in a lower level course may choose one of the techniques; such as a demo; exercise; assignment; or even experiment; to enforce learning and motivate the students to increase their chances of staying in the degree program or even switching to the software engineering program from other majors.

Decentralisation; direct and interactive communication; personalization and context are among the features of P2P systems that could be beneficial to groupware systems. In particular; such features can support monitoring; awareness; social networking and scaffolding in group collaboration. In this work we present an analysis of advantages in using P2P networks to better support group collaborative processes. In our analysis; P2P groupware systems are conceived as a convergence of several views: contextual computing; social media and semantic web. The contextual computing is an important ingredient to capture the context of the collaboration in a multi-dimension way; including workspace context; documents and information context; time and location contexts; etc. The social media is also considered important for an effective collaboration of peer group; to support members with efficient and scalable communication techniques in social interaction among members. The semantic web concepts and use of languages such as RDF/S enable the representation and reasoning with the diverse range of information required by the P2P middleware and the awareness services. We focus in particular how to achieve event-based awareness in P2P groupware systems that includes different forms of awareness. The user and technical requirements are first derived with reference to Project-Based Learning in P2P learning environments; which is the learning setting that we consider in our work.

These challenges include the general nature of a capstone that prevents deeper applications of skills; not to mention the difficulty of creating an interesting and engaging design project upon which students can make meaningful contributions and engage in extensive team dynamics. This experience report outlines an innovative approach to a senior design capstone course that addresses common limitations of capstone courses. The SimSYS capstone course is unique in that it involved a mixed team organization involving a more senior design team who led a development team over the course of the semester; thereby leveraging the diverse experience of capstone students completing their CS/SE degree.

However; group work can often emphasise product; rather than the processes that lead to the production of an artifact. Furthermore; co-writing activities also cause problems with the clear identification of group member contributions and the assessment of educational objectives. Wikis are implemented in the anticipation that students are applying knowledge; sharing; and engaging in cognitive and metacognitive processes as a group; however; exactly which cognitive and metacognitive processes occur behind the 'edits' of the wiki? This paper examines students' ""invisible"" behaviours as they co-construct a wiki response to a problem-based learning question. Our analysis confirms the complex nature of assessing ""process"" behaviours. The discussion space proved to be a valuable tool for students in the consultation and production of the wiki response and a number of cognitive and metacognitive behaviours emerged in the discussions.";"";"978-0-7695-4960-6";"10.1109/LaTiCE.2013.22";"";"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6542253";"problem-based learning;computer-supported collaborative learning;computer science education;metacognition";"Internet;Electronic publishing;Encyclopedias;Collaboration;Monitoring;Cognition";"cognition;computer science education;Web sites";"student cognitive behaviour;student metacognitive behaviour;Wiki construction;Web-based technology;collaborative practice;group work;problem-based learning;Wiki response";"";"2";"41";"";"";"";"";"IEEE";"IEEE Conferences"

The low cost allows each student to have their own robot for the semester; so they can work on activities outside the classroom. This robot was used in three different classes in which it was the foundation for an innovative problem-based learning curriculum. In particular; the robot has specialized sensors and a communications system that supports novel multi-robot curricula; which encourage student interaction in new ways.

However; a few key innovations appear useful in keeping undergraduate students motivated to learn; resilient to technology evolution; and oriented amid the overload of new information and ECE applications. Engineering clinics; similar to their medical clinic counterparts; provide project-based experiences within the core of an ECE education that enable transformation of the entire curriculum toward an outcomes-oriented; student-centered; total-quality environment. Clinics and project-based learning approaches build skills that give the students confidence and motivation to continuously self-learn and adapt as the technologies around them give way to new; more effective paradigms. Perhaps more importantly; engineering clinic experiences provide numerous opportunities for students to experience the holism of true engineering problem-solving approaches and the ranges of potential technology solutions. This paper reviews the clinic innovations that will enable ECE education to become more effective in the midst of the present plethora of information and technology.

Students are often lacking these skills even though they are desired skills to have both for academic success and in the workplace. For our research; we are exploring using virtual reality to teach four professional development skills to students. These skills are leadership; teamwork; communication and ethics. We are using virtual reality as an innovative tool to teach students these skills in an interactive and fun environment. This work-in-progress paper will discuss the activities that are being developed to teach engineering students professional development skills at Iowa State University. In this paper; we will discuss three activities that are being developed to teach these four different professional development skills. Our framework for these activities is using Game Based Learning (GBL); which is based on Problem Based Learning (PBL). Each activity will be based on a problem that students must work together to solve. Through this interaction; students will learn one or more of the professional development skills outlined in this paper. The goals and learning outcomes of each activity will then be outlined and discussed in more detail. We will outline the execution of each activity and how the interaction between the students and the virtual reality system will be accomplished. In this paper; we will show our current work in progress of the development of the game environment used in these activities. This will include screen shots and other examples of the game environment for each activity. The development platform used for these activities is the Unity platform; a free game development software package that includes tools for working with virtual reality. The virtual reality headset that will be used with Unity will be the HTC Vive. This allows us to have an interactive environment where students can see and hear in the virtual space and use controllers to interact with objects in the virtual space.

The U.S. Congress and other governmental and industrial organizations have recognized that teaching Quantum Computing in university-level Computer Science and Electrical Engineering programs is strategically important for workforce development along with technology development. Success in this endeavor requires generating genuine interest in the topic and motivating potential students. Quantum Computing requires an understanding of relatively difficult related subjects including physics; math and computer science. Many computer science and electrical engineering students shy away from quantum computing because of its complexity. This paper discusses our success with generating interest in quantum computing among graduate students and motivating them through exploring; in related courses; some aspects of quantum computing that have the potential to generate discontinuities. The approach is also examined in terms of the Scientific Learning Cycle as discussed by Wankat & Oreovicz. Opportunities and challenges of adding Quantum Computing to Computer Science and Electrical Engineering programs were studied through a student small group project in a cybersecurity course. The work built on extensive research into the effectiveness of small group projects and the role of “play” in learning. Our small group project on quantum computing was introduced three years ago into a cybersecurity course which is required for all students in our university's Masters in Computer Science and Masters in Electrical Engineering programs. The basic goals of the project are to teach students some basics of quantum computing by allowing them to “play with it” and to alert students to the fact that quantum computing is a rapidly developing new field that they need to follow during at least the next decade. The small group project helped students to explore the potential of quantum computing to substantially undermine current Public Key Cryptography and; at the same time provide a new approach to encryption that is even more secure than Public Key Cryptography. A qualitative analysis of discussions and assigned tasks suggests that this strategy succeeded in generating significant interest in quantum computing among students. They became motivated and immersed in a difficult subject despite the requirement for investment of significant time and effort to understand a complex combination of physics; math and computer science.";"2377-634X";"978-1-7281-1746-1";"10.1109/FIE43999.2019.9028378";"";"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9028378";"Cybersecurity;Learning Process;Motivation in Learning;Public Key Cryptography;Workforce Development";"Quantum computing;Education;Computer science;Public key cryptography;Electrical engineering;Physics;Computer security";"computer aided instruction;computer science education;educational courses;electrical engineering computing;electrical engineering education;public key cryptography;quantum computing;teaching";"quantum computing;electrical engineering students;electrical engineering programs;graduate computer science students;university-level computer science programs;scientific learning cycle;cybersecurity course;public key cryptography";"";"";"35";"";"";"";"";"IEEE";"IEEE Conferences"

Background: Internships and capstone projects are widely used to integrate work-related learning in computer engineering curricula. Both activities offer numerous benefits for students; industry; and academia. Although their effects have been extensively studied separately; the interaction between them remains unexplored. Research Questions: What is the effect of internships on the development of a subsequent capstone project? Methodology: The hypothesis was that the completion of an internship will have positive effects on several aspects of the capstone projects: 1) improved student competencies; 2) improved capstone project outcomes; and 3) decreased supervision effort. Further; these positive effects were expected to be greater in industry-based projects than in academic projects. The hypothesis was tested through a quantitative study of data collected from 274 computer science engineering capstone projects. A period of time with internships was compared with another period without internships; and differentiating between academic and industry projects. Findings: Internships prior to capstone projects improve student skills in autonomy; technology; methodology; and project management; increase the complexity and technological novelty of the resulting projects; and reduce advisor involvement in practical (technology; execution) and keep-the-project-alive issues; and increase advisor involvement in monitoring student work (meetings; reports; and initial arrangements).

Given the difficulty of assembling teams that best exemplify collaborative personality traits; it may be more beneficial for team members to recognize these traits so that their positive aspects can be exploited toward a successful product outcome. We employ IBM WatsonTM Personality Insights service to analyze team Slack.com posts collected from forty students across ten teams and two semesters of the capstone class.

To address these shortcomings; real customers were introduced; exposing students to real requirements uncertainty. Flipped classroom teaching was adopted; giving teams one day each week to work on their project in a redesigned laboratory.

This approach provides an insightful guide to implementing PBL from xPBL methodology; and provides instruments based on management techniques such as 5W2H (what; why; who; when; where; how and how much) and the production of artifacts to support the conception process of courses based on PBL.";"2377-634X";"978-1-4799-3922-0";"10.1109/FIE.2014.7044178";"";"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7044178";"PBL;Teaching and Learning Methodology;Management Processes;Design Course";"Software;Training;Planning;Guidelines;Context;Problem-solving";"computer science education;educational courses;software engineering;teaching";"teaching computing;NEXT;innovative educational experience;research group;learning methodology;PBL principles;flexible curriculum;authentic assessment process;technical tutors;process tutors;design course;PBL experiences;software engineering courses;xPBL methodology";"";"12";"13";"";"";"";"";"IEEE";"IEEE Conferences"

However; as the agile methods employed in the industry change and are adapted to different contexts; university courses must follow suit. A prime example of this is the Kanban method; which has recently gathered attention in the industry. In this paper; we describe a capstone course design; which adds the hands-on learning of the lean principles advocated by Kanban into a capstone project run with Scrum. This both ensures that students are aware of recent process frameworks and ideas as well as gain a more thorough overview of how agile methods can be employed in practice. We describe the details of the course and analyze the participating students' perceptions as well as our observations. We analyze the development artifacts; created by students during the course in respect to the two different development methodologies.

In this paper; we describe our process for composing development teams based on a pre-defined set of criteria that we have established from our experience conducting project courses since 2008 and constantly refined since. We reflect on these criteria by analyzing the team synergy and project satisfaction of participating students as well as their perspective on challenges in their teams in one concrete instance of a multi-project capstone course.

Typically; cohesive teams tend to develop software in a more coordinated and effective way; resulting in suitable products. Although these cohesive teams could be designed to try reaching such benefits; there is no recipe that allows us to do it in a simple way. Therefore; most of the software teams are formed using any other criteria; by losing thus the potential benefits of using cohesive teams. The problem of designing these teams is not only present in the software industry; but also in the academia; particularly in capstone courses; where the students run software projects in real or simulated scenarios. In order to help find a solution to this problem; particularly for academic settings; this paper proposes a heuristic to form software development teams; considering the psycho-social profile of the students. This heuristic was used to design teams for a software engineering project course at the University of Chile; and these teams' performance was compared to those from teams designed using random allocation of student to teams. The results indicate that teams designed using the heuristic were more effective in terms of internal communication and coordination than the other teams.

At the end of the activity; the teams reassembled to discuss the task the team had been assigned to do. The instructor revealed the role of the “moles” at this point; and the teams discussed the effect their behaviors had on team effectiveness and the strategies used to deal with the disruptive behaviors.

Following the normal order in a school semester leaves students with little time to develop code and little to show for their efforts besides long written reports. Students also work in a bubble; having little contact with anyone outside their immediate group. This paper describes an innovative approach in which students work on two half-projects in parallel during a semester; implementing a design developed by previous students while simultaneously developing a new design to be implemented by a following group. This approach not only starts implementation early; it also forces the students to coordinate their efforts with two different groups of students; whom they may or may not ever meet in person. That experience has not always been enjoyable; but it has demonstrated the value of quality documentation far more effectively than any lecture ever could. An added benefit is that they experience two different approaches to software engineering; and work on problems in two different domains.

Second; we performed 13 semi-structured interviews with the customer companies from the last instance of the course to collected their perspective. The main reasons for companies to participate in the course were: recruiting; getting the software developed and researching new technologies. A good project topic; according to our customer companies; has a clear vision; is suitably important for the customer company; is realistic with enough challenge; is motivating and illustrates the work at the company. Customers emphasized the importance of spending enough time with the teams and actively collaborating and communicating with them especially in the beginning; as the students might be too shy to ask enough questions. Typically; a customer representative used a few hours per week for the project and mostly collaborated with the team on the customer's premises.

Communication; leadership; creativity and management; known as soft skills; are increasingly needed in their positions. For that reason; undergraduate programs have been pushing to add the development of soft skills in their curriculum. One way to accomplish that change is using active learning approaches. Such approaches usually lead to more student participation in the learning process and; consequently; the development of particular soft skills. This research investigates the use of the active learning approach of Problem-Based Learning (PBL) to enable the development of soft skills of Computer Engineering undergraduate students. Students' skills were assessed through a Likert Scale questionnaire; investigating eight skill categories: Self-Management; Management; Interpersonal skills; Communication; Leadership; Decision Making and Problem Solving; Organization; and Analysis and Creativity.

In the context of a design-based research work; experienced teachers have adapted and applied a theory-derived agile model in a wide range of contexts. In this qualitative case-study; we analyze 11 interviews with 6 teachers on their observations from 20 agile projects with over 400 students. The aim is to gain insight into how agile practices assist individual learning processes and how they help teachers to design and organize projects in order to support students individually. A structured content analysis shows that agile teams face similar obstacles as teams in plandriven projects; but that they can overcome them better in agile projects. Additionally; the analysis indicates that in agile projects the quantity and quality of interactions increases; which has positive effects on the construction of sustainable skills and that students furthermore are frequently involved in feedback processes and reflections; which makes their learning more goal-oriented. Moreover; the data shows that teachers can identify their students' strengths and weaknesses better and also observe their individual learning processes better throughout agile project.

One way to overcome this challenge is to provide students with an authentic team project experience. Authentic student projects are those that are as close as possible to real projects in terms of uncertainty; complexity and diversity. In order to achieve this; collaboration with business and other external stakeholders is essential. However; such collaboration is often hindered by constraints around team structure; team and individual student assessment; the use of specific processes and technology; providing technical and other support; and fixed project durations. In this paper; we present a simple course structure and assessment process that has allowed us to remove the majority of such constraints; while maintaining integrity around student learning and assessment. By removing these constraints; we are providing students with authentic team project experiences that prepare them well for future employment. Preliminary evaluations of our approach indicate that despite several challenges; the experience has led to high levels of satisfaction among students and our external partners including employers.";"2165-9567";"978-1-5090-5467-1";"10.1109/EDUCON.2017.7942964";"";"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7942964";"";"Industries;Stakeholders;Collaboration;Proposals;Education;Conferences";"computer science education;educational courses;project engineering;software engineering;team working";"skills gap;student projects;course structure;student assessment process;student learning;team project experiences;employment;software engineering graduates";"";"";"15";"";"";"";"";"IEEE";"IEEE Conferences"

After detailing CSCW models that discuss the dimensions that characterise interaction and technology use in groups; we examine aspects of group learning from the perspective of theories of CSCL. Issues of cooperation versus collaboration; motivation for learning and models of group cognition are discussed in the context of two specific group projects. Analysis of these examples allows us to characterise behaviour within groups and provide insights that can facilitate the formation and effective development of project teams.

The aims of this study were to explore the effectiveness of second-year undergraduate computing students in carrying out a systematic literature review and to identify the elements of the process that the students found most difficult. A multicase case study of students carrying out an assignment to perform a systematic literature review (SLR) was undertaken. Students worked in groups and were studying across a range of computing programs. Data was collected from three sources: student grades; the comments made by the teaching staff on the submitted reports; and a debriefing questionnaire. All of the groups successfully completed the assignment. Results on which parts of the process were the most difficult were mixed; although much of the evidence suggests that the students found the conduct phase more problematic than the planning phase.

Skillful sharing of the intentions of search and their results is quite important to enable collaborative exploration to be smoothly conducted. However; such sharing is usually difficult for members since they often face difficulties in expressing search intentions into queries and suffer from the troublesome activity of page selection. Such problems become more serious for novices. In particular; it is important but difficult to sufficiently understand the differences between search intentions and actual browsing situations. Moreover; there is often insufficient mutual understanding of differences in search policies between members of collaborative exploration since they tend to superficially confirm the search results. This research was aimed at developing novel support to cultivate the consideration skill of search strategy focusing on the novices' understanding of search contexts.

The methodology for pair programming was performed in the university lab. The Scrum approach was performed in a Group projects for national level. We proposed two frameworks SIA and SEAM that uses the industry practiced models with the focus on pair programming and scrum in academics. Thus we propose two novel models named Scrum in Academia (SIA) and Software Engineering Agile Model (SEAM) in Academics while students engage in group projects as a team to get quality work to be submitted meeting deadline as if in industry.

The Engineering School at the Universidad de Chile has put in practice a strong women recruitment program. This brought that; for the first time; women reached 20% of the students enrolled in the fifth year software engineering capstone course. Problem: More women are entering the work force but there is still certain prejudice about women performance in STEM in general; and in software development in particular; since it is perceived as a man's activity. Method: In the context of the fifth year capstone course at the CS Department of the Universidad de Chile we conducted a field study in order to analyze the progression of self and peer assessment of men and women students along one semester. Results: We found that; even though peer assessment is similar for women and men; self assessment tends to be lower for women. Also; peer assessment does not vary much along the semester; neither for men nor for women. Conclusions: Women performance in software development teams is highly regarded by teammates. However; women do not seem to be willing to acknowledge their own performance.

Findings from this paper suggest that it is not enough to consider student-reported data in assessing team dynamics; hidden gendered behavior may be impacting students in ways that students do not realize or report. Background: Although the number of women in engineering is rising; difficulties still exist for female students in electrical engineering and computer science; particularly in team projects. Male and female students may have very different project experiences; due to differing levels of confidence/self-efficacy; difficult team dynamics; or inequitable task division. Research Questions: This paper aimed to elucidate what differences exist in the project experience between male and female students; considering self-reported measures (engineering confidence/self-efficacy; time spent on task; and team satisfaction) and observational study. Methodology: Students completed pre/post-project surveys; weekly logs; and post-project interviews to report and discuss their engineering confidence/self-efficacy; project task selection; and team satisfaction. This paper reports a case study of one student team; observed by a researcher throughout the project course. Findings: While student-reported data implied a lack of gender division (male and female students had the same levels of confidence; completed the same project tasks; and were similarly satisfied with their teams); the observational study implied that the student-reported data may not be telling the whole story. Given the difficult team dynamics observed in the student team (but not reported by students); findings suggest that difficult gender dynamics may go unrecognized by students.";"1557-9638";"";"10.1109/TE.2018.2820646";"University of Michigan; ";"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8338079";"First year experience;gender;project-based learning;teamwork";"Task analysis;Interviews;Instruments;Computer science;Electrical engineering;Problem-solving;Focusing";"educational courses;engineering education;gender issues;team working";"student-reported data;female students;team projects;engineering confidence/self-efficacy;project task selection;project course;project tasks;gender dynamics;electrical engineering;computer science";"";"";"30";"";"";"";"";"IEEE";"IEEE Journals"

Background: Many electrical engineering curricula offer a PE courses (PECs) for third- or fourth-year undergraduate students. Prior research on PEs education mainly focused on improving students' experimental skills through developing practical experiments; laboratory activities; and problem/project-based learning. An instructional approach that instead employs real-world knowledge and skills is worth evaluating. Intended Outcomes: Students should be able to consider realworld technical and non-technical limitations when applying theory to design PE circuits and converters; and be able to select and carry out appropriate tests to troubleshoot circuits. Application Design: Prior research on engineering education emphasized the importance of introducing real-world limitations to the students as part of their curriculum. This paper suggests that the tutorial activities presented in a PEC can help students acquire skills in designing and troubleshooting a circuit or system according to desired technical aspects; real-world limitations; and available data. Findings: Evidence of the validity of this approach in a PEC at two Australian universities; over four academic years; is provided. Students receiving the new tutorial activities had percentage scores some 10-15 points higher than those who had traditional tutorials.

This ability to work collaboratively can be as important to a project's success as their technical skills. Traditionally in STEM education; these collaborative skills are developed in a capstone course which mimics an industry experience. These experiences are invaluable in preparing students for the collaborative real-world nature of industry; however; these experiences can also be very stressful for students in dysfunctional teams with members who haven't developed necessary social; technical or teamwork skills. Although students may be exposed to some team-based activities in previous courses; it is not clear that this piecemeal exposure teaches students to work in teams effectively. Flipped classroom and active learning attempt to fill this gap by exposing students to peer learning earlier in the curriculum. However; these techniques are peppered throughout the curriculum and may not target all the skills necessary for teamwork. Design patterns in education formalize pedagogical approaches. But; applying design patterns without an intended progression or overarching goal may not lead students to successfully adopt these skills. Design patterns have the potential to scaffold students' development throughout the curriculum; but only if staged effectively and systematically. In this paper; we propose Spectrums and Dependency Graphs to ensure that students are prepared for each new design pattern as they experience it. Spectrums can plot design patterns along a continuum between introductory and capstone courses. Dependency graphs recursively specify patterns that prepare students for subsequent patterns. Each pattern will contain prerequisite skills or experiences that students have demonstrated in a previous pattern. In this way; students are systematically progressed from introductory to capstone courses. Through these two models; we attempt to get a better overview of the curriculum and create progressions through that curriculum that ensure students are prepared at each level; building on previous skills.";"";"978-1-5090-5920-1";"10.1109/FIE.2017.8190599";"";"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8190599";"design patterns;active learning;team-based learning;capstone;curriculum design;dependency graphs;spectrums;CS1;CS2";"Education;Engineering profession;Industries;Teamwork;Prototypes;Schedules";"educational courses;engineering education;teaching;team working";"spectrums;dependency graphs;capstone course;stakeholders;collaborators;technical skills;collaborative skills;industry experience;dysfunctional teams;active learning attempt;curriculum;design pattern;subsequent patterns;prerequisite skills;previous pattern;previous skills;teamwork skills;progression modeling;introductory courses;STEM education;flipped classroom;peer learning";"";"1";"21";"";"";"";"";"IEEE";"IEEE Conferences"

These environments provide unique constraints (e.g.; cultures where people are unfamiliar with or afraid of technology; environments where power and network connectivity are scarce and expensive). Students are partnered with organizations interested in piloting a solution they devise. The course brings together multidisciplinary teams of students to conduct fieldwork with potential user populations; design a technology to solve a problem inspired by a community-based organization; implement a solution; and evaluate that solution.

While the team's success is indeed the primary goal of an industrial SE team; ensuring individual learning is obviously an essential goal of SE courses.

There are many examples of agile methods taught in; for instance; capstone courses in software engineering programmes. It has been shown to be a popular and beneficial method of learning. However; most agile teams in the software industry are made up of members with different educational backgrounds (i.e. not just software developers; as there will also business analysts; designers; testers etc.). Such a diversity of roles might be beneficial in teaching agile methods in an academic setting. This reflective educational paper describes the evolution of an industry sourced problem-based agile student project; which over three successive years has included students from three different faculties. Although the experience has broadly been positive each year; this paper describes and reflects on both the good and problematic observations that the teaching staff has made over the years. The changes of the projects has been based by reflecting on these insights. These reflections are described and several recommendations are drawn from the experiences. These include; that it is important that the cohorts collaborate and work together in parallel. Individual groups; of diverse cohorts; should work in isolation. It is important to have industrial partners who are participating actively in the process; and it is important to not underestimate the work that is required by the academics to coordinate the projects to make them successful.";"2377-634X";"978-1-7281-1746-1";"10.1109/FIE43999.2019.9028544";"";"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9028544";"Agile Software Development;Teaching Agile;Problem-based Pedagogy.";"Education;Software;Industries;Agile software development;Collaboration;Web design;Computer science";"computer aided instruction;computer science education;educational courses;further education;groupware;software engineering;teaching";"interdisciplinary agile teaching;innovative practice paper;projectbased group work;conversion master students;agile software development methods;agile methods;capstone courses;software engineering programmes;agile teams;software industry;software developers;reflective educational paper;problem-based agile student project;collaborative work";"";"";"26";"";"";"";"";"IEEE";"IEEE Conferences"

Their learning objectives are no longer to obtain good grades but the practical skills to enable them to perform better in their work and advance in their career. Teaching software architecture to upskill these adult learners requires contending with the problem of how to express this level of abstraction practically and also make the learning realistic. We provide here our seven years' history of teaching software architecture of information systems to these adult learners as a part of a public continued education program. We describe our key challenges encountered at these levels and go on to analyze the results of the course design we have taken over the years. We also compare our teaching methods based on problem-based and case-based learning and examine their effectiveness for adult learners.

The tool contributes to the development of `soft' skills essential for students' future career needs. This paper reports on a phenomenographic study that investigates the research question: What are the ways in which academics teaching Open Ended Group Projects experience teaching the course? Previous studies; using the phenomenographic research approach; have offered insights into academics' conceptions of science learning and teaching. However; there are no studies that investigate the experiences of teachers who use OEGP in their classes. This is the first study; that asks academics using an OEGP how they experience teaching these courses. Students enrolled in a course on computing education research conducted the small-scale study at Uppsala University; Sweden. In order to answer the research question; a theoretical sample was selected with a wide range of relevant population characteristics (e.g. background; prior experience; gender; and age). The semi-structured interview questions focused on understanding of OEGP; the learning objectives of OEGP; strategies for teaching these learning objectives; and the teacher's experience in teaching through OEGP. The results indicate that teachers see their role within OEGP as a coach and that the variation between experiences lies in what is intended to be coached. This variation is presented in a hierarchy (the outcome space). Categories focus on: the team; discipline; problem solving skills; learning and motivation. We also look at the first-hand experience of a student in an OEGP course and discuss the teachers' perceptions of students' experiences of OEGP. The implication for teaching is that a teacher needs to reconsider the way he or she teaches more often in OEGP than in regular courses. There are two reasons for this. First; teaching OEGP is based less on teaching content knowledge and more on teaching skills. Secondly; OEGP deals with a `real problem'; and aspects of the problem continuously change. Teachers are recommended to aim for reaching a higher category; indicating a deeper level of experience; and to use the experience of coaching OEGP in other courses as well. The importance of metacognition (reflection on action) and discussion with other teachers who have experience in teaching OEGP is highlighted.";"";"978-1-5090-1790-4";"10.1109/FIE.2016.7757474";"";"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7757474";"Open Ended Group Project (OEGP);teaching experience;phenomenography";"Education;Interviews;Information technology;Context;Data analysis;Collaboration;Engineering profession";"computer science education;educational courses;engineering education;teaching";"metacognition;teaching skills;Sweden;Uppsala University;computing education research;computing courses;engineering courses;information technology courses;pedagogical tool;OEGP;phenomenographic study;open ended group projects;academics experience";"";"";"24";"";"";"";"";"IEEE";"IEEE Conferences"

An undergraduate capstone project typically involves a student development team as well as other stakeholders such as faculty advisors and industry mentors. Given that the agile development approach is adopted; a sprint review is conducted at the end of each sprint to demonstrate and critique the features that the development team have completed. Unlike the industrial settings; capstone design students can be challenged when conducting agile sprint reviews. On the one hand; the availability of industry mentors is unpredictable due to their own business commitments and schedules. On the other hand; it is extremely hard to bring all stakeholders together in one meeting. To overcome these difficulties; in our practice we have employed two strategies. First; we used a so-called agile buddy approach which allows each team to acquire an outsider student's opinion on their system.

Many successful cases of peer-to-peer models of organization arise and assume leading positions in world economy replacing; in many cases; the traditional hierarchical organization. People are evolving and interacting within heterogeneous teams composed by members from many different cultural groups and with distinct skills and backgrounds. Modern economy requires engineers to excel in collaborative and communication skills at an international setting. However; these competences are not usually addressed in most engineering curricula. We believe that in such a demanding and culturally diverse environment as the labour market is today; it is essential to promote team work and communication skills at an international and intercultural level. In the Multinational Undergraduate Team Work course; MUTW; students develop their capstone project as members of an international team while working at their home institutions. MUTW projects are to be developed by teams of final-year-undergraduate students from a multinational group of higher education institutions working to solve some engineering problem. Team members are geographically spread to assure heterogeneous teams and to promote international cooperation. This paradigm can be applied in any project/internship course unit. The results from the first edition are very encouraging supporting our initial hypothesis that MUTW significantly promotes students soft skills without requiring any change to prior degree curricula.";"";"978-1-4577-1672-0";"10.1109/ITHET.2011.6018683";"";"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6018683";"soft skills;students employability;capstone project course";"Seminars;Europe;Organizations;Training;Educational institutions;Context";"cultural aspects;educational courses;engineering education;further education;team working";"student team work skill;student communication skill;work organization;peer-to-peer organization model;cultural group;engineering curriculum;multinational undergraduate team work course;higher education institution;project course unit;internship course unit;skill international level;skill intercultural level";"";"4";"59";"";"";"";"";"IEEE";"IEEE Conferences"

Undergraduate programs have attempted to develop these abilities through capstone classes and by encouraging participation in co-ops and internships. At Ohio State University; nearly a dozen students have attempted to foster these abilities by doing long-term; real-world; large-scale; commercial-grade software development projects.

Well-formed planning; communication and intra-team skills are often differentiating elements among the most successful project teams. The abstract nature of these professional competencies requires a contextual basis to effectively develop within a higher cognitive domain. To this end; our capstone course has adopted a platform that offers students the freedom to choose a project sponsor that aligns with their own professional skills or desired learning environment. In a typical cohort we offer a mixture of industry sponsors (small to medium size local companies; emerging startups and established industry leaders) and faculty sponsors developing projects tied to their on-going research. Students have attributed this latitude in sponsor environment; character and style to their success in the course and transition to a professional career. This work offers an extension of this approach to include projects sponsored and managed by post capstone students.

In this paper; we present our experience in applying PBL to two subjects of computer science: Software Engineering and Distributed Systems. We describe how we use online platforms to implement PBL principles and discuss the impact of our approach on the learning performance of students.

To this end; it has become necessary to change educational practices in higher educational institutions. Inha University began developing a convergence education curriculum at the Innovation Center for Engineering Education in 2013 to cultivate undergraduate students with convergence competency. This paper describes the implications of the results of multi-year; multi-disciplinary convergence education and the effectiveness of various convergence education methods for continuous education improvement. The VIP (Vertically Integrated Project) course; which has been run every semester at Inha University since the spring semester of 2014; is designed to give students practical research experiences connected with the industry in advance and apply actual projects in which professors participate to undergraduate education. The curriculum is designed to improve students' major knowledge; research skills; and collaboration skills by teaming up multi-year and multi-disciplinary students. In addition; the effectiveness of convergence education is analyzed through various student evaluations every semester; and based on the results; the students' understanding of convergence education and the need for training convergent human resources in educational institutions are further expanded.";"2470-6698";"978-1-5386-0900-2";"10.1109/TALE.2017.8252375";"";"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8252375";"multi-disciplinary;multi-year;convergence education;team-based learning;project-based learning";"Conferences;Education";"computer science education;educational courses;educational institutions";"convergence project education;Industrial Revolution;convergence thinking;academic convergence;educational practices;higher educational institutions;Inha University;convergence education curriculum;Engineering Education;undergraduate students;multidisciplinary convergence education;convergence education methods;continuous education improvement;VIP;Vertically integrated projects";"";"";"14";"";"";"";"";"IEEE";"IEEE Conferences"

Typically; this work is conducted through a dedicated office that provides professional guidance in such areas as: resume writing; interview preparation; and job hunting. While these are all essential to a student's career development; students in the computer science discipline have additional needs that are not part of this general guidance. This need is due to the fact that a typical computer science program contains multiple; and often very different; concentration areas. This paper introduces the idea of how career guidance can be implemented at both the departmental and course level in the discipline of computer science. We are proposing a four-step strategy that is integrated into a student's four year computer science curriculum. As part of this idea; a required first year seminar course will help to introduce core concepts in each of the concentration areas found in the computer science degree within the respective department. In the student's sophomore year; a career planning module named “You and Your Options” will be embedded into various classes to help further expose the students to their career possibilities. During their junior year; students will have opportunities to be engaged in service-learning projects where their soft skills such as time management; conflict resolution; problems solving; and communication can be developed. Finally; in their senior year; a capstone or internship course will be required for every student in which they will complete a project that combines knowledge and skills from at least three areas in computer science. We believe that this approach will allow each student a deeper understanding about their specific strengths in the different concentration areas and provide them a more well-rounded experience. This proposed plan systematically and purposefully guides students in understanding their own strength and helps to identify areas of improvement; in both hard skills and soft skills. The effectiveness of this approach is demonstrated through both positive feedback from former students and employers; as well as quantitatively through increased job placement rate of graduates.";"";"978-1-5090-2218-2";"10.1109/ICCSE.2016.7581576";"";"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7581576";"career counselling;career development;computer science curriculum";"Engineering profession;Computer science;Career development;Seminars;Employee welfare;Interviews";"computer science education;educational courses;educational institutions;employment;further education";"career development integration;computer science undergraduate curriculum;career guidance;university services;resume writing;interview preparation;job hunting;course level;career planning module;you and your options;service-learning projects";"";"";"10";"";"";"";"";"IEEE";"IEEE Conferences"

The course design aligns with best practices for promoting development of students’ self-efficacy in solving ill-structured software design problems. Background: From Jonassen’s theory; problem-solving outcomes are dependent on the problem structure; complexity; and representation; and the characteristics of the solver. These characteristics are diverse; including knowledge; familiarity; and psychometric qualities of the solver (e.g.; self-efficacy and motivation). Thus; better problem-solving outcomes are dependent on the development of these traits; and on the problem characteristics. Intended Outcomes: Pre-2010; course learning activities and assessments overly focused on syntax. The course was redesigned with a focus on ill-structured problem solving and design in high-fidelity problem domains. Application Design: Complex and ill-structured lecture examples; assignments; and exams were redesigned to reinforce the importance of software design and problem solving. An open-ended cornerstone project using robotics was added as a structured means of providing students practice with solving ill-structured and open-ended problems. The assignment and exam questions; with the course cornerstone project; achieve instructional alignment in the course. Findings: The results show that students’ self-efficacy improved from start to end of term. The course design achieves several objectives: 1) students learned the requisite programming skills; 2) students developed their self-efficacy in programming and design; and 3) students demonstrated strong problem-solving outcomes.";"1557-9638";"";"10.1109/TE.2019.2959591";"";"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8957041";"Computing skills;design projects;instructional design;project-based learning;team-based learning";"Problem-solving;Programming profession;Software design;Task analysis;Robots;Complexity theory";"";"";"";"";"33";"IEEE";"";"";"";"IEEE";"IEEE Journals"

Competent embedded system engineers are becoming a scarce resource in the industry. Given this; universities should revise their specialist education to meet industry demands. In this paper; a spirally tight-coupled step-by-step educational method; based on an analysis of industry requirements; is proposed. The learning process consists of multiple learning circles piled up in a spiral. Each learning circle consists of three steps: lecture; demo; and hands-on practice; which are tight-coupled to enable students to readily revisit essential knowledge. The circle currently being studied is directly based on the previous circle; so as to maintain a smooth learning curve. Since students can quickly see the result of their work; their motivation to learn remains high. Since a learning circle takes only a short period to complete; the core knowledge and skills can be repeated in different forms across the three types of educational step so that students can master them. The students' achievement and performance using the proposed method show that it can enable them to master the requisite knowledge and effectively transform this into skills.";"1557-9638";"";"10.1109/TE.2010.2058576";"";"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5535217";"Embedded systems;engineering education;project-based learning (PBL);step-by-step learning;university–industry cooperative education";"Embedded system;Industries;Educational institutions;Spirals;Educational activities;Training";"educational institutions;embedded systems;engineering education";"competent embedded system cultivation;industry demand;competent embedded system engineer;scarce resource;spirally tight coupled step-by-step educational method;industry requirement;learning process;multiple learning circle;smooth learning curve";"";"15";"15";"";"";"";"";"IEEE";"IEEE Journals"

We ran a course experiment where we used the training game as a treatment; and a generic board game as a control.

Through interactive communication and collaborative work; team members can influence project outcomes both directly and indirectly. One method to examine influence is in terms of communication and control flow among team members when sharing a communication medium and artifact development tools. There currently exist several approaches for characterizing team communication using social network analysis. However; these approaches require modification to be applicable for measuring control flow influence in small teams. In this paper; we discuss the methodology and results of an influence study in which we analyze data generated by student teams in a capstone Software Engineering course. We develop three metrics to measure direct and indirect influence among team members; taking into account the temporal order of interactions and the small size of the teams studied. We correlate the influence metrics with grades; existing participation metrics; and team evaluation scores. The results suggest that our influence metrics correlate to a team member's perceived role on the team; measures of team communication and levels of task performance. This suggests that instructors can recognize the levels of influence exerted by team members by examining team communication and control flow; allowing for mediation prior to product development milestones.";"";"978-1-4799-8454-1";"10.1109/FIE.2015.7344106";"";"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7344106";"Computer science education;agile software development;collaborative work;social network analysis;centrality";"Social network services;Peer-to-peer computing;Software engineering;Atmospheric measurements;Particle measurements;Indexes";"computer aided instruction;computer science education;educational courses;groupware;social networking (online);software prototyping";"agile software development team;interactive communication;collaborative work;team communication;social network analysis;capstone software engineering course";"";"3";"12";"";"";"";"";"IEEE";"IEEE Conferences"

One important feature of P2P systems explored in this context is that of direct peer-to-peer communication. It has been shown in several recent research works that the direct communication between peers increases the interaction among peers and eventually the social and emotive support through peer-to-peer learning. Thus; P2P infrastructure helps creating a small social networking in online groups; in which end users (peer sat the edges of the Internet) can benefit from using aP2P infrastructure and thus overcome the limitations of reduced social interaction in web-based e-Learning systems. However; due to the dynamics of peers joining and leaving the system in an unexpected manner; such systems strive to provide availability of information. In this work we propose a replication-aware approach to increase availability of information in P2P super-peer systems.

Furthermore; few studies tackle nontechnical skills other than the development practices themselves. The work presented here introduces an original Scrum-based training model enhanced with agile coaching to maximize student performance. This was validated by a case study on a capstone project in a Scrum course. This paper summarizes the positive results of introducing agile coaching; which resulted in approximately 22% more coverage of software engineering practices.

The present paper deals with the planning and execution of a lighting design project to be implemented in several monuments and has as main objective the creation and/or replacement of the existing light fixtures with more efficient ones. The lighting systems are intended to illuminate monuments in order to ensure adequate visibility and comfort. The luminous efficiency of a luminary has a dominant influence on the energy consumption and; consequently; in maintenance costs and use of lighting. The project involved the lighting design of monuments or buildings considered relevant or of public interest with the purpose of enhancing their beauty; making them more attractive to the onlookers. A reinforcement of learning applied to the historical monuments lighting configurations will be described. The aim of the projects is also to demonstrate that LED technology allows for greater energetic efficiency in lighting design of monuments. The inherent advantages of replacing the existing solution with one that provides better energy performance will lead to a future reduction of carbon dioxide emissions (CO2); creating an environmentally friendly installation. The challenge was to design a computer aided lighting project using the problem based learning model. With software such as the Dialux computer program; it is possible to analyze the advantage of using correct floodlighting and to understand how software tools can be useful in lighting engineering projects.

However; the literature points to actual or potential difficulties faced by students in solving open-ended or complex problems. During Fall 2014; the authors' students experienced difficulties in solving open-ended bio-signals laboratory problems of designing input signals to analyze unknown systems via MATLAB programming. These difficulties resulted in low performance. Intended Outcomes: To support; or scaffold; problem-solving in subsequent semesters; a strategy of frequent and timely monitoring and feedback was used. The hypotheses were that these scaffolding strategies would be associated with enhanced performance on open-ended projects; and would support students in similar future work once removed. Application Design: Based upon strategies from the scaffolding literature; assignments that guided problem decomposition were used. Flipped instruction challenged students to prepare for the laboratory by reviewing worked programming examples and completing online assessments. The laboratory sessions were reserved for collaborative; hands-on programming; with instructor oversight; as in a problem-based learning environment. Students submitted frequent progress reports for self-monitoring and feedback throughout each project. Findings: A statistical comparison of project scores across semesters revealed performance improvements with scaffolding. Post-scaffolding assessment in a follow-up course determined scaffolding to be helpful and applicable by these students for similar projects. These preliminary results are important for STEM students and instructors encountering challenges with open-ended problem-solving of this nature; and they provide quantitative evidence recently called for by the STEM scaffolding literature.";"1557-9638";"";"10.1109/TE.2017.2755601";"";"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8068235";"Biomedical engineering;coaching;cognitive apprenticeship;open-ended problem solving;problem-based learning;progress reports;scaffolding";"Problem-solving;Biomedical engineering;MATLAB;Education;Employment;Programming";"computer aided instruction;educational courses;engineering education;mathematics computing;STEM";"problem decomposition;laboratory sessions;hands-on programming;self-monitoring;feedback;project scores;performance improvements;post-scaffolding assessment;course determined scaffolding;STEM students;STEM scaffolding literature;problem-solving performance;bioengineering lab;Engineering programs;workplace problems;actual difficulties;bio-signals laboratory problems;input signals;MATLAB programming;open-ended projects;online assessments";"";"2";"46";"";"";"";"";"IEEE";"IEEE Journals"

Hackathons are short events (1 to 3 days); where participants motivated by a common challenge gather into groups to build a software or hardware prototype. Studies show that learning is one of the main motivators of hackathon participants. Researchers are also pointing out the importance of hackathons as an informal learning approach for college students. The acquisition of knowledge comes as a result of the practice itself and with participants learning from one another. This motivated us to bring that practice to the classroom; by offering an undergraduate course where students develop their semester project within a hackathon. In an attempt to systematize the steps; compress and optimize the time allocated for the ideation phase of hackathon projects; we propose a methodology for hackathons in an educational setting. The approach combines concepts from Challenge-based Learning and Design Thinking in a sequence of activities that streamlines the ideation process with regular deliveries in short time frames. This results in objective discussions and quick decision taking; fastly arriving at a project idea where students apply what they learned over the semester. We applied our approach in an Internet of Things undergraduate course within the scope of a semester project developed in an authentic 24-hour hackathon that took place in a maker space.

The challenge in providing this when teaching undergraduate engineers is the dichotomy between achieving realism and maintaining sufficient simplicity to make the course tractable. A real-world group technology project at Victoria University of Wellington (VUW) in New Zealand establishes essential non-technical attributes required by the engineering profession while covering key elements of the project management body of knowledge (PMBOK). This paper first shows how the project covers the knowledge required in project management and then presents the results of two years of data collected from students' reflection on their own learning. We have established a pleasing congruence across the years against the specific learning topics of team working skills; communication skills and personal working skills with an improvement in project management skills. A key finding emerging from our analysis is the importance of reinforcement learning and reflective learning. We show a key link between these two learning mechanisms and the project pedagogy. Further analysis shows the link between the project pedagogy and four skill areas acquired.

Both Problem-based learning [2] and CDIO framework [1] are constructivist learning approaches [3] that emphasize these issues. In this paper; we discuss and elaborate some of the learning results of two interdisciplinary master's level student teams that were structurally organized as Capstone project courses [4]. The course projects had ill-defined and openended problem setting. The coaching for students was organized from the departments of Information Technology and Nursing Science at University of Turku. Students that participated in the project represented 3 higher education institutions and 8 disciplines. The disciplines were nursing science; engineering; sustainable development; computer science; social science; educational science; business and administration as well as futures studies. Altogether there were fifteen (15) students from two (2) different nationalities in this study. The results show that in a teamwork and problem oriented and project based setting [5] the learning of professional skills of the students can be enhanced both at the team and the individual level.

We propose an intelligent framework for monitoring individual or group performance during activity and problem based learning tasks. The system can be used to more effectively evaluate new teaching approaches and methodologies; identify weaknesses and provide more personalised feedback on learner's progress. We present a case study and initial experiments in which we apply the fuzzy LS technique for analysing the effectiveness of using a Group Performance Model (GPM) to deploy Activity Led Learning (ALL) in a Master-level module.

These developments led to increasingly complex engineering systems that tackle a wide range of societal needs. However; these also demand a broader skill-set for each engineer working with these systems and his/her training must span a greater range than that available in conventional engineering curricula. In order to deal with complex engineering systems; an engineer needs to have a good grasp of various technical fields such as computing; electrical; and mechanical engineering as well as competence in soft skills and systems thinking skills. This paper presents our multidisciplinary and project-based approach to impart these skills to our engineering students. The module consists primarily of conceive; design; implement and operate (CDIO) elements and aims to link diverse fields of engineering as well as developing the soft skills and systems thinking skills of our students. It is a year-long component of our Diploma in Engineering Systems course and it is offered in the second year of the curriculum in order to invoke these skills earlier in each student's professional life. The design and implementation process in this module integrates various fields and skill-sets; giving students a realistic experience in dealing with engineering systems. Before embarking on this module; students have already gained plenty of hands-on experience and project management skills through other project based modules such as Introduction to Engineering and Engineering Prototyping in their first year.

Using a mixed methods approach; we collected data through nine different sources: Engineering Design Metacognitive Questionnaire (EDMQ); Canvas™ course webpage; an e-Journal; written interviews; participants' weekly presentations; journey maps; participants' cloud storage (Google Docs and Box); and participant-researcher-email communications. These digital data (i.e.; voice; video; image; and text documents) are safely stored digitally in our secure network storage. This preliminary report addresses one major research question: In what ways do students actively employ self-regulated learning during design activities of a capstone senior design course. We drew upon Butler & Cartier's model of self-regulation and Dym & Little's design process frameworks to answer this question. The analysis used 48 e-Journal entries as its main source. We classified participants' entries by their design processes and activities; two engineering experts assisted in categorizing dubious records. Our data and interpretations were triangulated against other data sources during these processes to increase corroboration of our collected data. Our preliminary findings suggest that (1) groups' efforts were focused in conceptual design and project management activities; (2) groups' design processes were dynamics; and (3) management activities were reported throughout the project time. Further analysis will include other data sources; especially transcripts of students' weekly presentations; journey maps; and written interview responses; to uncover teams' self-regulation strategies during the design process.";"";"978-1-5090-1790-4";"10.1109/FIE.2016.7757481";"";"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7757481";"engineering design;self-regulation";"Project management;Context;Instruments;Monitoring;Wheelchairs;Interviews;Planning";"aerospace engineering;cloud computing;computer aided instruction;control engineering education;educational courses;engineering education;mechanical engineering;project management;team working;wheelchairs";"secure network storage;self-regulated learning;capstone senior design course;Butler-Cartier model;Dym-Little design process framework;conceptual design;project management;project time;digital data;participant-researcher-email communication;Google Box;Google Docs;participant cloud storage;journey map;participant weekly presentation;written interview;e-journal;Canvas course Webpage;EDMQ;engineering design metacognitive questionnaire;India;low-cost motorized wheelchair;semiparalyzed lady;patient lift system design;classroom environment;self-regulation strategy;aerospace engineering capstone design course;mechanical engineering;senior engineering students;project teams;capstone design courses;student self-regulation";"";"1";"30";"";"";"";"";"IEEE";"IEEE Conferences"

We propose a methodology that introduces the study of microcontrollers using Arduino to develop different types of projects and proceeds to study the system architecture to gain control on the device. This methodology has been used in an undergraduate course in microcontrollers and a graduate course in advanced techniques in digital design. The students of the microcontrollers course showed improved design skills and motivation compared to the students from previous versions of the course.

The course starts with 18 hours of in-class lectures and activities intended to prepare the students for on-site work through a combination of technical and non-technical skills. The students then work in engineering design and construction for a minimum duration of 240 hours under the direct supervision of practicing engineers. Specific activities and outcomes of the field component are directly mapped to the course learning outcomes; and are defined prior to commencing the fieldwork. The student's work is continuously monitored by the academic instructor through a journal or daily logs submitted periodically. Multiple assessment tools are used throughout the course; including homework assignments; in-class activities; an oral presentation; a detailed final report; and direct observation by the supervisor. A letter grade is earned at the end of the course; which affects the student's GPA.

In recent years; a number of Educational Robotics projects and initiatives have emerged; mainly focusing on introducing children and youth to Robotics; but without going into greater detail on fundamental Robotics concepts. In order to close the gap between these introductory Robotics courses for beginners at K-12 level and common Robotics university courses; the MINT-Robo project was developed. Based on previously implemented K-12 Robotics projects; it is designed around the central topic of autonomous mobile robots. Complex contents; usually taught at university level; are prepared for the project's target group. Following the principles of constructionism; the project comprises a variety of hands-on elements; applying a project-based learning approach.

There is an ongoing need to adapt university courses to changing requirements and shifts in industry. As an educator it is therefore vital to have access to methods; with which to ascertain the effects of curriculum design changes. In this paper; we present our approach of analyzing software repositories in order to gauge student behavior during project work. We evaluate this approach in a case study of a university undergraduate software development course teaching agile development methodologies. Surveys revealed positive attitudes towards the course and the change of employed development methodology from Scrum to Kanban.

Traditionally; students learn about the engineering design process through design-only projects such as redesigning an electric toothbrush or selecting components for a renewable-energy powered water well. Although these projects were hands-on; they did not include students converting the design concept to a tangible product. In fall 2017; a new project using Arduino kits was introduced to the course. Students were asked to build a line-following robot car with a chassis of their own design as long as it kept the wires and circuit board inside. In designing the robot car; students sketched design concepts; selected the best one; and used low-fidelity materials to create beta prototypes. Once they had a working chassis; students created it in Autodesk Inventor and realized the final design of the chassis through 3D printing and laser cutting.To measure if the new hands-on project has an impact on student learning; students were asked to report which instructional activity they learn best from and how they relate engineering design to real life before and after the project. We found that at the completion of the robot car project; students became less in favor of lecture-based instructions. Rather; they have developed a preference in figuring out the solutions on their own. Students highly appreciated the open-ended design project and the hands-on experience of building a prototype.As with any project carried out for the first time; the robot car design project ran into some technical difficulties. Nonetheless; students reported that this hands-on project is fun and rewarding; and they now have a much deeper understanding of the engineering design process behind every product in the market. This paper discusses the student design project in detail; including the results of the project based off of student surveys and faculty observations; and suggestions for improvement and implementation at other schools.";"2377-634X";"978-1-5386-1174-6";"10.1109/FIE.2018.8658819";"";"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8658819";"hands-on;project-based learning;Arduino;first year experience;engineering design";"Autonomous automobiles;Encoding;Rapid prototyping;Collaboration;Solid modeling";"computer aided instruction;control engineering computing;control engineering education;design engineering;educational courses;mobile robots";"robot car design project;engineering design course;first-year engineering project;Penn State Erie;Behrend College;Arduino kits;Autodesk Inventor;open-ended design project;hands-on experience";"";"";"15";"";"";"";"";"IEEE";"IEEE Conferences"

A key challenge; therefore; is producing graduates with an understanding of a number of disparate skills across many discipline boundaries. Undergraduates may be knowledgeable in one specific discipline but will not be aware of the issues brought to bear by other relevant disciplines. In an effort to overcome this limitation; a cross-discipline course “Serious Games and Welfare Technology” was developed that allows students from different disciplines to work together to produce innovative; technology- supported health solutions. The course; an EU funded Erasmus+ initiative; was supported by a MOOC and enabled multi- disciplined and multinational teams to produce solutions for leading Health technology companies in the areas of rehabilitation and aging support.

The course is organized as an eight-day; full-time block laboratory for over 300 freshman students; who were supervised by more than 60 tutors from 23 institutes of the Electrical Engineering Department. Based on a threefold learning concept comprising mathematical methods; MATLAB programming; and practical engineering; the students were required to transfer mathematical basics to algorithms in MATLAB in order to control LEGO Mindstorms robots. Toward this end; a new toolbox; called the ¿RWTH-Mindstorms NXT Toolbox;¿ was developed; which enables the robots to be controlled remotely via MATLAB from a host computer. This paper describes how the laboratory course is organized and how it induces students to think as actual engineers would in solving real-world tasks with limited resources.

This is usually performed via students carrying out software projects; working in teams. In such environments; the knowledge sharing and the interactions within the team are worth investigating; as they can affect the outcome of the student collaboration and can provide insight on how the collaboration is valued by the team members. Research Questions: 1) What is the effect of TMS on students in SE education? 2) Do parameters; such as gender; affect TMS development? 3) Does the inclusion of a project manager with more expertise affect TMS? Methodology: Students were divided into teams working on SE projects. Teams consist of both undergraduate and postgraduate students.

Therefore both approaches are based in constructivism and problem based learning; but each one has specific characteristics and benefits. Thus; a teaching and learning approach that combines the two could have different or perhaps more promising results than with just one of the individual methodologies.

Results from these analyses suggest that although teams with leaders have many more communications throughout a project; they have similar temporal patterns as compared to teams without leaders. However; the proportion of the different communication behaviors varies considerably between leader and leaderless teams as well as between leaders and their “followers.” More specifically; analysis demonstrated how variation in temporal patterns for leaders and their followers were different from those team members with no leader; thereby bolstering the argument for developing and testing temporal measures in group research.";"";"978-1-4673-2740-4";"";"";"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6450928";"leadership;virtual team;distributed learning;computer-mediated communication;temporal analysis";"Lead;Planning;Software;Reflection";"software development management";"leadership;temporal pattern;global software development team;temporal communication pattern;global software student project team;archived group interactions;virtual team projects;content analysis scheme;collaboration theory;communication behavior;virtual environment;leaderless team;testing temporal measures;group research";"";"";"48";"";"";"";"";"IEEE";"IEEE Conferences"

They can thus learn to take more care of distribution challenges and risks when starting to develop software in industry. However; providing a sustainable environment for such project courses is difficult. A development environment is needed that can connect to different distributed teams and an ongoing routine to conduct such courses needs to be established.

One of those emerging technologies for teaching nowadays is using robotics. In the field of engineering and technology; programming is one of the most vital and challenging skills to learn. Programming can be tough for novices especially for those who have not acquired any basic programming skills. Robots have been used in the past few years to support the teaching of programming. Researchers have found that students are more interested in programming through robots utilization in teaching compared to traditional teaching methods. Therefore; this study has proposed a way for teaching and learning of programming to be more effective through adapting an existing Project-Oriented Problem-Based Learning (POPBL) framework. Most research works in the past have only implemented the teaching of programming using robotics through a Problem-Based Learning (PBL) framework without considering a systematic PBL framework. Thus; this work aims to study the effectiveness of using a mobile robot known as `RoboKar' as a tool to support the learning of introductory programming by adapting an existing POPBL framework. The effectiveness of the adapted framework was assessed by evaluating three categories of learning comprising analytical and problem solving; learner's knowledge; as well as; collaborative learning. Our study results showed that by adapting a POPBL framework; students can acquire a better understanding in learning introductory programming concepts.";"";"978-1-5386-1523-2";"10.1109/WEEF.2017.8467073";"";"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8467073";"Project-Oriented Problem-Based;Teaching Computer Programming;Educational Robotics";"Programming profession;Education;Robots;Problem-solving;Conferences;Games";"computer aided instruction;computer science education;educational courses;groupware;mobile robots;robot programming;teaching";"systematic PBL framework;mobile robot;adapted framework;collaborative learning;learning introductory programming concepts;project-oriented problem-based framework;emerging technologies;robotics;basic programming skills;robots utilization;learning framework;computer programming teaching;POPBL framework";"";"";"12";"";"";"";"";"IEEE";"IEEE Conferences"

The student project teams' final applications attained varying degrees of complexity; which led to complaints from students. An approach to approximate the size of project tasks is to model project tasks by a feature model. The features in this model are weighted with function points. Then; each project task can be refined as a product configuration derived from the feature model with a predefined total number of function points.

In conjunction with the role-play; a gamification framework was used within the course to allow students to customize their course participation. Gamification was used to reward students for compliance with software process steps and for taking the initiative to improve their “soft skills”.

To improve student engagement in quantitative based course like Math; Accounting or Science; it is of supreme importance that students are able to make connections between knowledge and its application to a real world context. Two such cases of Contextual Learning have been presented in this paper which was modeled in implementation of interdisciplinary projects across Accounting and IT disciplines; with Business students enrolled in Managerial Accounting and Cost Accounting courses and CIS students in Mobile Application course and ICT. This study aims at presenting a contextual strategy used to enhance Accounting and IT skills in Undergraduate students at Dubai Women's College; Higher Colleges of Technology. We posited that through this contextualized approach; students would see Accounting; Computational thinking and app development as tools for solving work-related problems. Using Constructivist teaching and REACT (relating; experience; application; collaboration and transfer) strategy; we initiated curriculum integration of both Accounting and IT; which deviates from traditional teaching model where learning of a subjects is isolated from any context. We conclude that the interdisciplinary projects implemented were a robust technique for application of contextual learning.

In this paper; we propose a unified framework for the assessment of student outcomes based on senior design experiences of undergraduate computer engineering students. Senior design experiences provide unique opportunities for students to demonstrate their abilities; skills; and experiences that are attained throughout a bachelor of engineering program. The proposed framework is built upon capstone design projects and senior design courses. The learning outcomes of senior design courses can be carefully designed to map to all student outcomes. Accordingly; senior design courses can lead to accurate assessments at the program level and within a simple setup of senior courses. The proposed framework allows for sound evaluations of student performance and project qualities. The developed framework comprises criteria; indicators; extensive analytic rubrics; and a summative statistical formulation. The framework is supported by evaluative and comparative analyses of course and student outcome assessments within a pilot study.";"2165-9567";"978-1-4673-8633-3";"10.1109/EDUCON.2016.7474554";"";"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7474554";"capstone design projects;senior design courses;embedded system design;assessment;programmatic accreditation;ABET;student outcomes";"Embedded systems;Computers;Accreditation;Microcontrollers;Electrostatic discharges;Field programmable gate arrays;Program processors";"computer science education;design engineering;educational courses;further education;statistical analysis";"student outcomes assessment;senior computer engineering design experiences;technical higher education;senior design experiences;undergraduate computer engineering students;engineering program;capstone design projects;senior design courses;student performance evaluation;project quality evaluation;extensive analytic rubrics;summative statistical formulation;student outcome assessments";"";"1";"12";"";"";"";"";"IEEE";"IEEE Conferences"

It is a culmination of skills and knowledge acquired during the course. the experience and excellence of the FYP is the strong factor to increase the self-confidence and market oriented skills for a student. The growth of IT sector is always exponential and competitive. The development of FYP using traditional approach is inefficient in developing skills and knowledge for many students. Traditional approach is weak in addressing the issues like time constraint; in adequate guidance; high expectation without proper direction and poor technical knowledge. Thus; student's ends up with low-quality IT projects which is neither benefit to them nor benefit to society. Further fear of grade; take students in to malpractices in order to accomplish FYP i.e. full plagiarism and illegal outsourcing. This paper proposes a streamlined approach to ensure to produce high quality and efficient project. We categorize FYP development as five main modules namely requirement; development; demonstration; documentation & presentation. This is a three-tier architecture; which involves student; teacher & IT industry. Further; a short outcome-based assessment procedure is developed for each module. We also propose a framework of a computerized management system for the processing of a FYP including a structured project allocation to students; a comprehensive assessment procedure; an automated processing of marks; and a management supporting system.

In practice however; the learning agreement invention is uncommon in education and not well understood. As it is used in the present study; it is essentially a document in which the students describe competencies that they want to develop; as well as how they will develop and assess those competencies. This study has investigated the learning agreement intervention as it was conducted in an open-ended group project; in particular a workshop to improve the quality and usefulness of the students' learning agreements. Two versions of learning agreements; the one before the workshop and the one after; from 19 students were analysed; as well as semi-structured interview data with the students. We find that many learning agreements are of little use; even after the workshop. A qualitative thematic analysis suggests that the students experience the learning agreement and workshop as useful but that they still struggle with the learning agreement; particularly with describing activities to develop and assess their learning.

For a dynamic classroom; we used an interactive computer programming environment; Repl.it; as a top-level shell and created several in-class exercises; assignments; small lab-based projects. In addition; we used an eBook; which offers an animation and software visualization tool where students can step through code line-by-line and a program editing and execution area where students can execute examples; change them; and execute the updated code. We also introduced collaborative learning at the beginning of this introductory programming course in the form of doing team projects submitted at the end of the semester. The students were instructed to commit code to GitHub which ensures that their work will not be lost as well as; provide them basic task management tools to collaborate. The proposed pedagogical approaches were applied in the Fall'2017 semester to teach an introductory CS course in Python.

The development of this ability is however not prominent in engineering education despite numerous authors suggesting open-ended problems as a pedagogical tool to promote development of collaborative problem solving competence by including elements of group or project work in courses. In our own long experience of using open-ended problems in collaborative student projects; we have identified a lack of systematic progression in learning outcomes and skill development. We see this as a major obstacle for fully exploiting the potentials of using open-ended problems as an educational tool. We present a framework that provides a structured view of challenges related to openness that students can encounter in educational projects and that has an impact on the overall complexity of the project. We argue that there are different categories of openness to consider when designing educational settings based on open-ended projects. The categories addressed in this paper are: Character of the problems addressed. Character of the teams. Time constraints. Faculty involvement. External factors. Aspects of openness in the different categories are presented and related to professional engineering competencies. Furthermore; it is discussed how variations in project complexity can be accomplished by variations within the aspects and combinations of aspects.

Additionally; college students; at present; are immersed in the 4th Industrial Revolution; so; as educators; we focus on 3D printers; electronics; robotics and IoT. For this reason; our strategy is to engage the students in their learning process with new educational methodologies; face different projects and foster new challenges in the teaching-learning process. The learning objective is to integrate the students in an active participation to build their knowledge and develop their skills. This work shows the efforts carried out to increase the students' motivation and interest of self-taught. They must be creative and exposed students to information that runs careers which are far from the exact and natural sciences. The pilot test was implemented in the Physics course belonging to the Business and Information Engineering careers. The combinations of various methodologies such as Flipped Classroom; Project Based Learning; Cooperative Learning and Design Thinking; among others; were used. The introduction of basic principles of robotics and programming language; ending with the student's training in 3D printing technologies were the key that students develop the capacity of working in a multidisciplinary team and applying the mentioned methodologies.

Therefore; this paper proposes the approach of mobile groupware (MobileMeeting) that can be integrated (i.e.; embedded) into the popular social media posts that students currently use as a supplementary tool for collaborative learning. An investigation was conducted in real project-based scenarios with students; followed by post-session questionnaires including a log-report analysis from Google Analytics as supporting evidence. This study confirms that the proposed approach using MobileMeeting is capable of improving collective learning productivity and activities; including their satisfaction with the required groupware tools. The log-report analysis of students' case projects (social media marketing campaigns) also displays an increment in user engagement and retention by bringing the new user and a large number of returning user.

Hence; one group project may consist of various sub-group activities with different communication strategies based on the needs of the task. Currently; the existing systems do not provide the mechanism for users to define their own sub-group communication dimensions with preferable users. To this end; we propose an approach to enable the propagation communication dimension that associated with sub-group activity in the collaborative workspace.

Community based service learning has long been promoted as a viable and effective means of improving student engagement by the use of both practical experiences and periods of reflection. In 2008; a pilot project was initiated to examine opportunities to embed service learning into the degree programmes offered by the discipline of Electrical & Electronic Engineering. This has now evolved into a programme which all undergraduate students of the discipline (i.e. completing bachelor programmes in Electronic Engineering and Electronic & Computer Engineering) must complete during the third year of their four year under-graduate degree programme. This module has replaced a traditional group project based module which typically involved project topics related to either course work or the research interests of academic staff. The new service learning based module requires the students to complete a 6 month group project involving community partner organisations who work with clients who have various forms of physical disabilities. A focus group based evaluation of the module involving the various stakeholders in the initiative is presented in the paper. This review highlights the degree to which the module achieves its aim of enhancing the learning outcomes across the complete technical and non-technical skills spectrum.";"";"978-1-4244-6042-7";"10.1109/TEE.2010.5508846";"";"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5508846";"";"Engineering students;Design engineering;Educational institutions;Informatics;Context-aware services;Electronic engineering education;Web sites;Computer aided instruction;Project management;Business communication";"computer aided instruction;computer science education;electronic engineering education";"learning outcomes;electronic engineering students;computer engineering students;service learning based project module;undergraduate degree program;focus group based evaluation";"";"1";"5";"";"";"";"";"IEEE";"IEEE Conferences"

A common practice to address that need is to introduce a capstone unit where students complete large assignments in teams and consolidate previously acquired concepts and skills. Increasingly; such projects are supported by a given software development methodology in order to familiarize students with these processes and facilitate implementation. While the growing prevalence of Agile methods in the industry is reflected in a proliferation of studies of their use in academic contexts; the application of traditional approaches does not capture much attention in research. This experience report discusses the introduction of a Waterfall model to support student teams developing Artificial Conversational Entities for an industrial client. The course structure and accompanying methods; adaptations of the process; lessons learned and recommendations for academics wishing to use a traditional method as part of a university class are presented. Our study shows that such an approach yields promising results for complex and state-of-the-art projects and practices associated with it enforce students' software-engineering skills.";"";"978-1-7281-3421-5";"10.1109/SEAA.2019.00054";"";"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8906735";"software and its engineering; software creation and management; software development process management; software development methods; waterfall model";"";"";"";"";"";"24";"";"";"";"";"IEEE";"IEEE Conferences"

In this paper; we empirically evaluate a method that enables ethically aligned design in a decision-making process. Though this method; titled the RESOLVEDD strategy; originates from the field of business ethics; it is being applied in other fields as well. We tested the RESOLVEDD strategy in a multiple case study of five student projects where the use of ethical tools was given as one of the design requirements. A key finding from the study indicates that simply the presence of an ethical tool has an effect on ethical consideration; creating more responsibility even in instances where the use of the tool is not intrinsically motivated.";"";"978-1-7281-3421-5";"10.1109/SEAA.2019.00015";"";"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8906730";"artificial intelligence; ethics; design methods; ethical tool; RESOLVEDD; developer commitment";"";"";"";"";"";"23";"";"";"";"";"IEEE";"IEEE Conferences"

Although secure data management (SDM) is a major facet of overall information systems security; it has received less attention than it deserves. However; at the Rochester Institute of Technology; an SDM course has been offered since 2003. This course covers both commercial practice and current research; and has been revised continually to keep the technical content current; and to incorporate active learning approaches; additionally course delivery has moved from a traditional classroom lecture setting to a blended and fully online (distance delivery) setting. On the practical side; student projects involve the design and development of secure database applications on hardened database servers; and include an attack phase when students get to break into other student projects. On the research side; students explore current topics in the literature and incorporate aspects of their research readings into their implemented projects.

The paper also presents a demonstrated solution to this in the form of the CHARM (Coin Handling Arm for Robotics Mastery) robot; which addresses the autonomous coin sorting problem using an economical kit made from commodity computing hardware and three Dynamixel servomotors. From a learning perspective; this problem facilitates interdisciplinary practice across subject and grade levels with an algorithmic foundation that is central to modern robotics. Evidence supporting this approach is illustrated from case studies of student projects and; in particular; the CHARM robot. Beyond practice alone; by presenting a challenging (but manageable) research problem; we found that the coin sorting task teaches robotics in a principled way. Further; algorithmic complexity tiers the problem to academic levels. While motivated by robotics education; the (optimal) coin sorting problem may also be seen as an archetype problem for manipulation/motion-planning research. Thus; this also promotes a research foundation supporting later research opportunities.";"2153-0866";"978-1-4799-6934-0";"10.1109/IROS.2014.6942917";"";"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6942917";"";"Robot kinematics;Sorting;Planning;Kinematics;Robot sensing systems;Cameras";"educational robots;path planning;sorting";"CHARM robot;robotics education;multilevel task;coin handling arm for robotics mastery robot;autonomous coin sorting problem;dynamixel servomotors;motion-planning research";"";"";"16";"";"";"";"";"IEEE";"IEEE Conferences"
