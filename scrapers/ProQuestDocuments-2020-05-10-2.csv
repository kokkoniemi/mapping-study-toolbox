The use of a wiki to boost open and collaborative learning in a Spanish university;"Spanish universities are attempting to offer a more flexible and higher- quality education that is adapted to new social demands. As a result, they are offering a series of technological resources in both university management, as well as, in teaching and research - developments which are encouraged by the educational convergence process, occurring within the European Higher Education Area. In this article, we analyze how a group of university teachers seeks to promote an experience of active collaboration and open education amongst their students through the creation of a Wikipedia site. The goal was to promote a different, more flexible teaching system, where both the teacher and the students break away from their classic roles. This experience was started in order to achieve the following results 1) motivate learning, 2) encourage active-collaborative learning 3) create a dictionary of the terms related to political science that helps to explain key concepts to students and the public, and 3) improve the quality of education. Despite facing certain obstacles, the results were positive the students became committed to this practice, learned to collaborate in groups, and solved problems by interacting with their classes; their interest in subjects was increased, and useful tools for other people were created. Moreover, the teachers introduced new pedagogical methods in their classes and made learning relate to their students in a different way. In short, the results show that the use of wiki is effective in improving university teaching. https//doi.org/10.34105/j.kmel.2020.12.001";2399900854;Scholarly Journals;;"Gema Sánchez Medero;Gema Pastor Albaladejo";;; © 2020.

Investigating the use of LEGO® Bricks in education and training: A systematic literature review;In spite of increasing attention paid for LEGO® as a learning tool rather than a child toy, teaching practices and methodologies in the use of LEGO® varies according to educational contexts. The purpose of this paper is to investigate various educational contexts of LEGO® usage in higher education and to identify trends of teaching practices. A systematic literature review was conducted on the use of LEGO® bricks in education and training using an exploratory sampling approach. 298 articles in total were explored in internationally recognized journal databases using keyword search and 26 articles were selected for detailed review process. We found that there is a clear distinction in LEGO® usage between learning facilitation and thinking facilitation and also between individual application and group application. A simple typology with four quadrants is proposed on the basis of our findings for facilitating novice educators to introduce LEGO® to their pedagogical design.;2389241150;Conference Papers & Proceedings; National University of Singapore, 25 Lower Kent Ridge Rd, 119081 Singapore , National University of Singapore, 25 Lower Kent Ridge Rd, 119081 Singapore , Ristumeiakn University, 2-150, Iwakura, Ibaraki, Osaka, 567- 8570, Japan;"Liang, Desmond Ng Yong;Yun, Florence Ng Jia;Minato, Nobuaki";;; Copyright The International Society for Professional Innovation Management (ISPIM) 2020;; Conference Proceedings;; 2020;;;; English; English; 1-15; Manchester;2020;ISPIM Conference Proceedings;2020;;https://search.proquest.com/docview/2389241150?accountid=11774;;;;;; 1;; Teaching , Higher education , Students , Quadrants , Science , Learning , Trends , Studies , Education , Methods , Literature reviews , Systematic review , Teachers , Bricks , Training , Robotics , Literature reviews;;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=proceeding&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aabiglobal&amp;atitle=Investigating+the+use+of+LEGO%26reg%3B+Bricks+in+education+and+training%3A+A+systematic+literature+review&amp;title=ISPIM+Conference+Proceedings&amp;issn=&amp;date=2020-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=1&amp;au=Liang%2C+Desmond+Ng+Yong%3BYun%2C+Florence+Ng+Jia%3BMinato%2C+Nobuaki&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=ISPIM+Conference+Proceedings&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/";ProQuest Central,SciTech Premium Collection
Mapping research in student engagement and educational technology in higher education: a systematic evidence map: Revista de Universidad y Sociedad del Conocimiento;"Digital technology has become a central aspect of higher education, inherently affecting all aspects of the student experience. It has also been linked to an increase in behavioural, affective and cognitive student engagement, the facilitation of which is a central concern of educators. In order to delineate the complex nexus of technology and student engagement, this article systematically maps research from 243 studies published between 2007 and 2016. Research within the corpus was predominantly undertaken within the United States and the United Kingdom, with only limited research undertaken in the Global South, and largely focused on the fields of Arts &amp; Humanities, Education, and Natural Sciences, Mathematics &amp; Statistics. Studies most often used quantitative methods, followed by mixed methods, with little qualitative research methods employed. Few studies provided a definition of student engagement, and less than half were guided by a theoretical framework. The courses investigated used blended learning and text-based tools (e.g. discussion forums) most often, with undergraduate students as the primary target group. Stemming from the use of educational technology, behavioural engagement was by far the most often identified dimension, followed by affective and cognitive engagement. This mapping article provides the grounds for further exploration into discipline-specific use of technology to foster student engagement.";2343531287;Scholarly Journals; Carl von Ossietzky Universität Oldenburg, Faculty of Education and Social Sciences (COER), Oldenburg, Germany (GRID:grid.5560.6) (ISNI:0000 0001 1009 3608) , Universität Duisburg-Essen, Learning Lab, Essen, Germany (GRID:grid.5718.b) (ISNI:0000 0001 2187 5445) , Carl von Ossietzky Universität Oldenburg, Faculty of Education and Social Sciences (COER), Oldenburg, Germany (GRID:grid.5560.6) (ISNI:0000 0001 1009 3608) , Carl von Ossietzky Universität Oldenburg, Faculty of Education and Social Sciences (COER), Oldenburg, Germany (GRID:grid.5560.6) (ISNI:0000 0001 1009 3608) , Universität Duisburg-Essen, Learning Lab, Essen, Germany (GRID:grid.5718.b) (ISNI:0000 0001 2187 5445);"Bond, Melissa;Buntins Katja;Bedenlier Svenja;Zawacki-Richter, Olaf;Kerres, Michael";;; International Journal of Educational Technology in Higher Education is a copyright of Springer, (2020).

Multimedia Approaches to Learning the Foundations of Library and Information Science;This paper presents a case study of two types of multimedia resources that were integrated as supplementary learning materials into the design and delivery of two different graduate courses on the historical foundations of library and information science (LIS): video and audio lectures from an online course on the history of information (integrated into a doctoral seminar), and a curated playlist of a weekly public radio broadcast on the history of ideas (integrated into a master's course). It also considers some of the limitations of compiling LIS-related audiovisual materials from disparate online sources, with references to examples. By analyzing and critiquing these three applications of multimedia resources in LIS graduate courses, this paper attempts to answer the following research question: Beyond traditional pedagogical strategies such as lectures and text-based readings and assignments, how might students, practitioners, and the general public gain a sweeping understanding of our field? The paper aims to help LIS educators to diversify their pedagogical strategies and reach people outside their classrooms. By incorporating these kinds of multimedia resources into course designs, educators may help to empower students to actively and creatively apply what they learn in class to the analysis of historical events, biographies, and social movements, develop technical skills that will benefit their professional development, and produce deliverables that can be shared on public platforms to reach a wider audience beyond LIS classrooms.;2338288491;Scholarly Journals; Faculty of Information, University of Toronto , Faculty of Information, University of Toronto , Faculty of Information, University of Toronto;"Guzik, Elysia;Griffin, Brian;Hartel, Jenna";;" University of Toronto

Constraints and strategies for effective use of social networking sites (snss) for collaborative learning in tertiary institutions in nigeria: perception of tvet lecturers;The popularity of using social networking sites (SNSs) as an educational tool is increasing every day. Many educators are now trying to integrate these online teaching platforms that were provided by commercial services such as Google, LinkedIn and Facebook into learning environment. Despite the importance of SNSs, a lot of constraints seem to hinder its effective use for collaborative learning in Nigeria by TVET lecturers. Therefore, the main purpose of this paper is to ascertain the perception of TVET lecturers on the constraints and possible strategies to effective use of SNSs for collaborative learning in tertiary institutions in Nigeria. The study adopted a descriptive design. A questionnaire was used to collect data from 128 TVET lecturers purposively drawn from the four tertiary institutions in Enugu State that offers vocational and technical education programme. Mean, standard deviation, exploratory factor analysis and t-test statistics were used in realizing the objectives. The finding of the study showed among others that, 13 SNSs were commonly used by TVET lecturers, 13 major constraints hinder effective use of SNSs for collaborative learning by TVET lecturers, while 10 strategies were proffered to promote the effective use of SNSs for collaborative learning. This paper therefore calls for continuous professional development (CPD) of TVET lecturers particularly to enable them acquire the needed soft skills required for effective utilization of SNSs in their teaching practices.;2260128867;Scholarly Journals; University of Nigeria, Department of Computer and Robotics Education, Faculty of Vocational & Technical Education, Nsukka, Nigeria (GRID:grid.10757.34) (ISNI:0000 0001 2108 8257)  , University of Nigeria, Department of Industrial Technical Education, Faculty of Vocational & Technical Education, Nsukka, Nigeria (GRID:grid.10757.34) (ISNI:0000 0001 2108 8257)  , University of Nigeria, Department of Agricultural & Bio-Resources Education, Faculty of Vocational & Technical Education, Nsukka, Nigeria (GRID:grid.10757.34) (ISNI:0000 0001 2108 8257)  , NwaforOrizu College of Education, Department of Computer Science Education, Nsugbe, Nigeria (GRID:grid.10757.34) ;"Olelewe, Chijioke Jonathan;Orji Chibueze Tobias;Osinem, Emmanuel C;Rose-Keziah, Ikemelu Chinelo";;; Education and Information Technologies is a copyright of Springer, (2019).

The Impact of Using Inverted Classrooms on Promoting Extensive versus Intensive Reading Comprehension among Iranian Upper-intermediate EFL Learners;"This study aimed to investigate the impact of inverted classrooms on promoting Iranian EFL learners' extensive and intensive reading comprehension. To fulfil, 60 Iranian upper-intermediate EFL students out of 90 were chosen based on an Oxford Quick Placement Test. The selected participants were randomly divided into two experimental groups; intensive reading group (n=20) and extensive reading group (n=20), and a control group (n=20). Then, the three groups were pretested. After that, the researcher put the participants of both experimental groups in two inverted classrooms.

Integration of good practices of active methodologies with the reuse of student-generated content: Revista de Universidad y Sociedad del Conocimiento;"In this article, we present an integrated instructive methodological approach. We begin with a set of proposals for educational innovation oriented towards active learning that have been tested separately and implemented for various subjects in courses of different levels. The approach integrates the following elements: (1) the dynamic generation of digital content by students and their integration into shared knowledge bases of the subjects involved; (2) the systematic use of quality content, mainly in video format, distributed through online platforms as support for flipped classrooms; (3) peer evaluation to support the development of reflective and self-critical capacities; and (4) systematic collaboration with students and professors from other universities to develop the enumerated activities. The methodology has been tested in a variety of subjects, thanks to its flexibility. In all experienced cases, it has been shown that it is feasible for students to generate enough valuable and reusable content. In addition, students have expressed high levels of satisfaction with the implementation of the proposal.";2203095213;Scholarly Journals; Departamento de Lenguajes y Sistemas Informáticos, Facultad de Informática, Universidad del País Vasco/ Euskal Herriko Unibertsitatea (UPV/EHU), Donostia / San Sebastián, Spain , Departamento de Lenguajes y Sistemas Informáticos, Facultad de Informática, Universidad del País Vasco/ Euskal Herriko Unibertsitatea (UPV/EHU), Donostia / San Sebastián, Spain , Departamento de Lenguajes y Sistemas Informáticos, Facultad de Informática, Universidad del País Vasco/ Euskal Herriko Unibertsitatea (UPV/EHU), Donostia / San Sebastián, Spain , Departamento de Lenguajes y Sistemas Informáticos, Facultad de Informática, Universidad del País Vasco/ Euskal Herriko Unibertsitatea (UPV/EHU), Donostia / San Sebastián, Spain , Departamento de Lenguajes y Sistemas Informáticos, Facultad de Informática, Universidad del País Vasco/ Euskal Herriko Unibertsitatea (UPV/EHU), Donostia / San Sebastián, Spain;"Arruabarrena, Rosa;Sánchez, Ana;Blanco, José M;Vadillo, José A;Usandizaga, Imanol";;; International Journal of Educational Technology in Higher Education is a copyright of Springer, (2019).

AN INVESTIGATION OF INDUSTRY 4.0 SKILLS REQUIREMENTS;The Industry 4.0 wave is built on technological advancement that is bringing about significant change. The impact of Industry 4.0 is being felt across all industries, including the education sector. During the 2019 State of the Nation address, the President of South Africa pointed out that the government was seeking to respond to the change in skills requirements. In this paper, a systematic literature review will be performed to investigate Industry 4.0 skills requirements in the engineering profession and the role of capability development in meeting Industry 4.0 requirements. An exploration of the impact of Industry 4.0 on technical institutions as opposed to academic institutions will also be discussed. This paper incorporates this exploratory investigation into detailed research on developing a skills development framework that seeks to bridge the gap between Industry 4.0 skills requirements and development in South Africa.;2318594831;Scholarly Journals; Author affiliations School of Industrial Engineering, North-West University, South Africa , Author affiliations School of Industrial Engineering, North-West University, South Africa , Faculty of Engineering, NorthWest University, South Africa;"Maisiri, W;Darwish, H;van Dyk, L";;; © 2019.

Teaching Critical Thinking, Problem Solving, and Design Thinking: Preparing IS Students for the Future;Critical thinking and problem solving skills are included in the IS curriculum as foundational skills. IS education researchers recognize the importance of these skills for future IS practitioners given the complexity of the technology based society and economy of the future. However, there is limited work on how these skills are best taught in IS. This research reports on a course focusing on the explicit development of critical thinking and problem solving skills of first-year IS students at the University of Pretoria. The critical thinking part of the course focuses on the analysis, evaluation of, and response to arguments. Class discussions and assessments are based on local, authentic arguments. In the problem solving skills component of the course, students are taught to understand the nature of a problem and to classify it as belonging to one of three categories: puzzles, problems, and messes. For each category, appropriate problem solving approaches are suggested and practiced. To illustrate the role of design and creativity in problem solving, students have to create an artefact using the Maker Space of the university. They have to apply the five phases of design thinking as suggested by the Stanford d.school design thinking approach. The course has been presented since 2016, and feedback is collected from students annually. Based on a feedback questionnaire that the students complete at the end of each course, we have reason to believe that they find the course valuable and consider those skills to be applicable to other courses as well as elsewhere in their lives. They also point out the value it holds for their future as IS practitioners. As part of our ongoing research, we are investigating ways to develop a critical disposition amongst students, an important component of critical thinking.;2327876457;Scholarly Journals;;"Matthee, Machdel;Turpin, Marita";;" University of Pretoria

Knowledge Sharing in an Agile Organization;"The goal of this paper is to identify fields requiring improvement in ""organizational knowledge sharing"" in an agile organizations. It has been proven that ""agile methods"" highly facilitate ""knowledge sharing"" in a project team. Agile development allows a productive, flexible, and adaptive environment, when limitations of knowledge sharing are important. Knowledge is an important resource for agile organisations. This knowledge is transformed into products and services during the development process. Knowledge sharing is essential throughout any organisation. Knowledge creates the value for the organisation and this value increases when it is shared. Organisational knowledge sharing aims at transferring to the organisation the information, skills and expertise a person or team has. Nowadays, ""agile development methods"" have attracted particular attention in the software development community. Agile development approaches rely on socialization through communication and collaboration to access and share tacit knowledge within project teams. However, implementing knowledge sharing is not an easy task for agile development teams compared to its increased demand. The main benefit of Agile Project Management is its ability to respond to issues as they arise throughout the course of the project. Making a necessary change to a project at the right time can save resources and, ultimately, help deliver a successful project on time and within budget. Agile project methodology breaks down projects into small pieces that are completed in work sessions that run from the design phase to testing and quality assurance. These sessions are called ""sprints"", the term for iteration used in one specific and popular agile development method known as ""scrum"". In this paper, we will explore the role that ""knowledge sharing"" plays in agile organizations. We will review agile methods and agile practices available in the literature improving ""organizational knowledge sharing"" in an agile company and finally, review survey knowledge sharing techniques for agile software engineering. The development of the survey will be an object for another paper.";2317556828;Conference Papers & Proceedings; Research Department of Computer Science (CRI), Sorbonne University, Paris, France , Department of Business Administration, Applied Science University, Kingdom of Bahrain;"Demigha, Souâd;Kharabsheh, Radwan";;; Copyright Academic Conferences International Limited Sep 2019; 10.34190/KM.19.102; Conference Proceedings;; Sep 2019;;2048-8963;; English; English; 267-277,XVIII; Kidmore End;Sep 2019;European Conference on Knowledge Management;2019;;https://search.proquest.com/docview/2317556828?accountid=11774;;;;;; 267;; Information systems , Competitive advantage , Principles , Project management , Collaboration , Process controls , Teams , Product development , Documentation , Quality assurance , Organizations , Knowledge sharing , Project management , Knowledge management , Knowledge management , Methods , Software engineering , Quality control , Strategic management , Software engineering , Company structure , Software development;;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=proceeding&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aabiglobal&amp;atitle=Knowledge+Sharing+in+an+Agile+Organization&amp;title=European+Conference+on+Knowledge+Management&amp;issn=20488963&amp;date=2019-09-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=267&amp;au=Demigha%2C+Sou%C3%A2d%3BKharabsheh%2C+Radwan&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=European+Conference+on+Knowledge+Management&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/10.34190%2FKM.19.102";ProQuest Central,SciTech Premium Collection
The Impact of Digital Learning Tools on Student Performance;A lot of emphasis in the present times is on transiting towards student-centric learning which aids in creating authentic student experiences by engaging them in higher order thinking as compared to traditional instructional teaching in classrooms. A knowledge of how students engage in digital learning tools can play a vital role in managing and leveraging technology for enhancing the student learning. Studies on the effect of the usage of digital technology on the academic performance and subsequent placement of the students graduating from higher education institutions are very limited. This study explores the impact of the usage of digital learning tools on the academic performance and placement package of the students. This exploratory study involved primary data analysis of240 students enrolled and passed out from two years' business management course in a B-school in India. Academic performance is strongly correlated with the time spent on digital learning tools. However, a very weak and insignificant correlation is observed between the time spent on digital learning tools and the final placement package received. The regression model is significant for the impact of usage of digital learning tools on the academic performance of the students (adjusted R2 = 0.659). However, the model is not significant (adjusted R2 = -0.004) for the impact of usage of digital learning tools on the placement package received by the students.;2311513252;Scholarly Journals; Assistant Professor, Jaipuria Institute of Management, Indore, Madhya Pradesh India , Assistant Professor, Jaipuria Institute of Management, Indore, Madhya Pradesh India;"Attri, Rekha;Kushwaha, Pooja";;; Copyright IUP Publications Sep 2019;; Journal Article;; Sep 2019;;0973-2896;3; English; English; 47-59; Hyderabad;Sep 2019;IUP Journal of Information Technology;2019;15;https://search.proquest.com/docview/2311513252?accountid=11774;;;;;; 47;; Teaching , Data analysis , Placement , Learning , Regression models , School environment , Tools , Online instruction , Educational technology , Regression analysis , Learning management systems , Higher education institutions , Business administration , Distance learning , Students;;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Ahightechjournals&amp;atitle=The+Impact+of+Digital+Learning+Tools+on+Student+Performance&amp;title=IUP+Journal+of+Information+Technology&amp;issn=09732896&amp;date=2019-09-01&amp;volume=15&amp;issue=3&amp;spage=47&amp;au=Attri%2C+Rekha%3BKushwaha%2C+Pooja&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=IUP+Journal+of+Information+Technology&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/";ProQuest Central,SciTech Premium Collection
Exploring the effectiveness of STEAM design processes on middle school students’ creativity;"Creativity has an important role in many scientific processes which constitute a large and complex structure. It is difficult to identify and measure. Students’ creativity can be enhanced through specific education programs. The aim of this study was to develop a science, technology, engineering, art, mathematics (STEAM) design process program for teaching 7th grade middle school students to enhance their verbal and figural creativity. The study lasted 11&#xa0;weeks. Pre-test/post-test quasi-experimental method with a nonequivalent control group was used. Study Group (n = 34) was presented a teaching approach focused on STEAM education, while the control group (n = 34) was taught based on the science curriculum and science textbook. Nine different STEAM design activities were developed. The data were collected with the Torrance Test of Creative Thinking. The SPSS Program was used in analyzing the data. At the end of the study, significant differences were determined in favor of the study group in both verbal and figural creativity.

Investigating the relationship between learning style and game type in the game-based learning environment;The game-based learning, which uses computer games to improve performance and learning, is a new field which can be used as a powerful educational tool. To increase the effectiveness of educational games, new games fit the learning styles of each individual can be made to have a customized learning environment. Currently, playing computer games have become far more widespread among Iranian youth and teenagers who are mostly students. Accordingly, this study investigated the relationship between the Felder-Silverman learning styles model (FSLSM) and four types of games. To this end, the research data were collected from 121 students at the universities in Qom province. Then the results are analyzed using Pearson’s chi-squared test and Crosstab. Three of seven hypotheses (the relationship between visual learning style and simulation game, sequential learning style and puzzle game, sensing learning style and casual game) were confirmed which can be the guide to design games in the environment of game-based learning more effectively.;2193417831;Scholarly Journals; Faculty of Management & Accounting, College of Farabi, University of Tehran, Qom, Iran , Faculty of Management & Accounting, College of Farabi, University of Tehran, Qom, Iran;"Jafari, Seyed Mohammadbagher;Abdollahzade, Zahra";;; Education and Information Technologies is a copyright of Springer, (2019).

Effects of B-learning and F2F on college students’ engagement and retention in QBASIC programming;Achieving learner engagement in the teaching and learning process is paramount towards ensuring knowledge retention in QBASIC programming. This study focuses on effects of b-learning and face-to-face (F2F) on college students’ engagement and retention in QBASIC programming. The study adopted quasi-experimental design with non-equivalent group research design. QBASIC Programming Achievement Test (QBPAT) and College Students’ Engagement Questionnaire (CSEQ) were instruments used for data collection. Results showed that the treatment groups’ retention mean score was significantly higher than the control group.

Four Strategies for Driving a University Pre-College Computing Outreach Program;A public university's computing outreach program focused on four key strategies for increasing the depth and breadth of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education. This paper describes the development and implementation of a project management hands-on learning laboratory activity within the context of the university's outreach strategies. The first two strategies, establishing relationships with the primary and secondary (K-12) level partner schools and implementing whole-grade participation, have led to repeat visits by students over several years. The third strategy, hands-on learning laboratory activities, has successfully engaged K-12 students, as indicated by the assessment results that provide evidence of successful student learning. The fourth strategy, producer-consumer collaborations, has facilitated the efficient matching of faculty expertise with K-12 teacher needs. The results include the evidence that outreach strategies can have a positive influence on student engagement in STEM education at multiple points in the K-12 education experience.;2291512131;Scholarly Journals; Computer Science Department University of Alabama in Huntsville Huntsville, AL 35899, USA;"Landry, Jeffrey P;Barnett, Harvey L;Chapman, Debra L;McCullough, Rosalind";;" Bureau of Labor Statistics

How Does Competition Help Future Learning in Serious Games? An Exploratory Study in Learning Search Engine Optimization;"Serious games, many of which are multi-player games, have been commonly used in information technology education and training. Competition can be intuitively associated with games; however, it is not always considered as a necessary attribute of serious games. Particularly, the learning impact results of competition are mixed. Challenge and control are two game attributes that are highly relevant to competition. With the use of a multi-player serious game, SEO War, this study aims to explore the relationships among competition, perceived control, perceived challenge, and self-efficacy in a game-based learning environment. Particularly, it investigates whether competition leads to self-efficacy. It also examines whether perceived challenge and perceived control mediate the relationship between competition and self-efficacy in serious games. This study contributes to the expanding literature on selecting important attributes for serious games, and it advances our understanding of the mechanism of how competition leads to self-efficacy. Moreover, it will help game designers decide on important game attributes through which games can be enhanced.";2291510656;Scholarly Journals; Faculty of Business and Economics The University of Hong Kong , Department of Computing The Hong Kong Polytechnic University , Faculty of Business and Economics The University of Hong Kong;"Lee, Philip T Y;Lui, Richard W C;Chau, Michael";;; Copyright EDSIG Summer 2019;; Journal Article;; Summer 2019;;1055-3096;3; English; English; 167-177; West Lafayette;Summer 2019;Journal of Information Systems Education;2019;30;https://search.proquest.com/docview/2291510656?accountid=11774;;;;;; 167;; Computers , Students , Perceptions , Games , Learning , Competition , Marketing , Hypotheses , Studies , School environment , Optimization , Effectiveness , Researchers , Educational technology , Research & development--R&D , Search engines , Information technology , Games , Software engineering , Education , Skills , Designers , Competition;;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aabiglobal&amp;atitle=How+Does+Competition+Help+Future+Learning+in+Serious+Games%3F+An+Exploratory+Study+in+Learning+Search+Engine+Optimization&amp;title=Journal+of+Information+Systems+Education&amp;issn=10553096&amp;date=2019-07-01&amp;volume=30&amp;issue=3&amp;spage=167&amp;au=Lee%2C+Philip+T+Y%3BLui%2C+Richard+W+C%3BChau%2C+Michael&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=Journal+of+Information+Systems+Education&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/";ProQuest Central,SciTech Premium Collection,Social Science Premium Collection
Co-Designing of a Mobile Educational Tool for Innovative Teaching and Learning at the College of Business Education, Tanzania;Mobile technologies are increasingly becoming tools for enhancing access and smooth sharing of information, products, and services. In this realization, this study used a design science research users’ participatory approach to co-design a mobile application prototype known as CBE Mobile Educational Tool (CBEMET) to enable lecturers of the College of Business Education (CBE) in Tanzania to share educational materials. The co-design of the prototype involved 3 researchers, one application developer and 25 lecturers of CBE. The testing of the CBEMET prototype shows that downloading and uploading of education resources to the system is adequate. The results also indicate that the prototype enables the access of uniform departmental-related materials by lecturers of the same department at different locations and, in so doing, it increases the quality of teaching and learning at the college. Furthermore, the testing of the prototype revealed that the design meets the requirements of the lecturers and has brought a significant change in their teaching and learning practices. The impact of the study is that it sets a groundwork for future studies involving lecturers in higher education and developers in co-designing and co-developing mobile education tools for innovative teaching and learning in Tanzania and in other emerging economies.;2275066060;Scholarly Journals;;"Godfrey Isaac MWANDOSYA;Calkin SUERO MONTERO;MBISE, Esther- Rosinner";;; Copyright Sakarya University 2019;; Journal Article;; 2019;;;3; English; English;; Adapazari;2019;TOJET : The Turkish Online Journal of Educational Technology;2019;18;https://search.proquest.com/docview/2275066060?accountid=11774;;;;;; n/a;; Co-design , Educational materials , Learning , Prototypes , Applications programs , Education , Business education , Higher education , Research design , Tools , Mobile computing , Prototypes , Teaching , Learning , Educational technology , Tanzania;;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aeducation&amp;atitle=Co-Designing+of+a+Mobile+Educational+Tool+for+Innovative+Teaching+and+Learning+at+the+College+of+Business+Education%2C+Tanzania&amp;title=TOJET+%3A+The+Turkish+Online+Journal+of+Educational+Technology&amp;issn=&amp;date=2019-07-01&amp;volume=18&amp;issue=3&amp;spage=&amp;au=Godfrey+Isaac+MWANDOSYA%3BCalkin+SUERO+MONTERO%3BMBISE%2C+Esther-+Rosinner&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=TOJET+%3A+The+Turkish+Online+Journal+of+Educational+Technology&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/";ProQuest Central,SciTech Premium Collection,Social Science Premium Collection
Gamification in Management Education: A Systematic Literature Review;Quality of teaching is increasingly important for the success of educational institutions. In this context, gamification is a tool often used to improve the teaching-learning process by helping both teachers and students reach their goals in the short, medium and long term. Given the importance of the topic both in academia and society, this article presents a systematic review of the literature on the use of gamification as a tool to enhance the quality of the teaching process in general, and, in particular, the teaching of management. The study searches the most relevant literature on the application of gamification to educational contexts and describes gamification's main themes and constructs based on a systematic literature review of scholarly articles available in ISI Web of Science and Scopus databases. One of the main results of this study is to describe theoretical approaches to gamification and provide a conceptual model that gathers the contribution of various studies and paves the way for future research.;2271748168;Scholarly Journals; Universidade de Trás-os-Montes e Alto Douro, Vila Real, Portugal , Universidade da Beira Interior, Covilha, Portugal , Universidade de Trás-os-Montes e Alto Douro, Vila Real, Portugal;"da Silva, Rui Jorge Rodrigues;Rodrigues, Ricardo Gouveia;Leal, Carmem Teresa Pereira";;; © 2019.

How systematic reviews cover practitioners' issues: A study on Stack Exchange communities;"Context: One of the goals of Evidence-Based Software Engineering is to leverage evidence from research to practice. However, some studies suggest this goal has not being fully accomplished. Objective: This paper proposes a strategy to assess how systematic reviews cover practitioners' issues in software engineering. Method: We selected 24 systematic reviews identified by a comprehensive tertiary study. Using search strings of the selected systematic reviews, we queried most relevant practitioners' issues on five active Stack Exchange communities, a professional and high-quality Question &amp; Answer platform. After examining more than 1,800 issues, we investigated how findings of the selected systematic reviews could help to solve (i.e. cover) practitioners' issues. Results: After excluding false positives and duplicates, a total of 424 issues were considered related to the selected systematic reviews. This number corresponds to 1.75% of the 26,687 most relevant issues on the five Stack Exchange communities. Among these 424 issues, systematic reviews can successfully cover 14.1% (60) of them. Based on a qualitative analysis, we identified 45 recurrent issues spread in many software engineering areas. The most demanded topic is related to agile software development, with 15 recurrent issues identified and 127 practitioners' issues as a whole. Conclusions: An overall coverage rate of 14.1% reveals a good opportunity for conducting systematic reviews in software engineering to fill the gap of not covered issues. We also observed practitioners explicitly demanding for scientific empirical evidence, rich in context and oriented to specific target audiences. Finally, we also provided guidelines for researchers who want to conduct systematic reviews more connected with software engineering practice.";2195775316;Scholarly Journals;;"Cartaxo, Bruno;Pinto, Gustavo;Kamei, Fernando;Monteiro, Danilo;Queda, Fabio;Soares, Sergio";;" Stack Exchange Inc

Student Perceptions on the Role of the Classroom Environment on Computer Supported Collaborative Learning;The physical classroom remains the one constant space where most schooling takes place and where everyday Computer Supported Collaborative Learning (CSCL) practices in formal educational settings occur. While educational advocates have championed the need for a change to schooling, pedagogy and various teaching and learning practices, the learning environment where these activities are taking place especially at the university level remain the same year after year, creating challenges for those attempting to implement CSCL. In this paper we argue that we cannot improve learning without looking at how the physical classroom space and furniture layout is designed and its impact on learning. Given that the CSCL research emphasizes social interactions, collaboration and knowledge growth, all of which should be occurring in the classroom, it seems appropriate to look at classroom space and changing pedagogies.;2156687262;Scholarly Journals; Educational Technology, School of Educational Foundations, Leadership and Aviation, College of Education, Health and Aviation, Oklahoma State University, Stillwater, OK, USA , Department of Design, Housing and Merchandising, Oklahoma State University, Stillwater, OK, USA;"Asino, Tutaleni I;Pulay, Alana";;; TechTrends is a copyright of Springer, (2018).

Determinants of the Effectiveness of Using Renewable Resource Management-Based Simulations in the Development of Critical Thinking: An Application of the Experiential Learning Theory;The twenty-first century’s society experiences new challenges in being immersed in a new paradigm of the educational system. Higher education institutions should train professionals so that they are able to experience real situations in order to encourage reflection on affective, aesthetic, and ethical dimensions of these people in their relations with the natural and sociocultural environment. Learning strategies must allow the acquisition of creative, active, and applied knowledge as well as the development of critical thinking. According to the experiential learning theory, to achieve this, higher education should use student-centered interactive and collaborative teaching methodologies and focus studies on the skills that graduates must have, promoting student know-how, initiative, and autonomous learning. Business simulations are instruments that fulfil the above characteristics, facilitating learning. The objective of this research was to provide a model that identifies the determining factors (simulation’s realism and structure, perceived usefulness, and students’ learning motivation) in the effectiveness of using these tools to develop critical thinking focused on sustainability. Three hundred and twenty-six surveys completed by undergraduate students were obtained, which used a structural equation model (SEM) to analyze the influence of realism, simulation structure, perceived usefulness, and students’ motivations to develop critical thinking. The outcomes according to the experiential learning theory showed that the game’s realism lets students perceive its usefulness and, together with an adequate simulation structure, determines the students’ learning motivations by developing critical thinking.;2398143313;Scholarly Journals;;"Urquidi-Martín, Ana C;Tamarit-Aznar, Carmen;Sánchez-García, Javier";;" United Nations--UN

Impact of self-regulated learning on academic performance and satisfaction of students in the online environment;"The concept of self-regulated learning (SRL) hasn’t been researched enough in Bosnia and Herzegovina (B&amp;H) and hence this study represents an important milestone in understanding this concept in this context. The conducted research was initiated with the presupposition that SRL had a positive impact on satisfaction and academic performance of students. In order to prove the goals of the research, two main hypotheses were formulated. The results of the exploratory factor analysis (EFA) have shown that the statements within SRL are grouped into five factors goal-setting, metacognition, environment structuring, computer self-efficacy and social dimension. Multiple regression analysis proved that 4 of 5 factors have a positive impact on satisfaction and academic performance of students. Only goal-setting yielded no significance on the two aforementioned variables, while remaining four factors showed a significant influence on students’ satisfaction and academic performance. https//doi.org/10.34105/j.kmel.2019.11.018";2311734655;Scholarly Journals;;"Adisa Ejubović;Puška, Adis";;; © 2019.

The Underrepresentation of Females in the United States Cybersecurity Workforce: A Multiple-case Study;The demand for cybersecurity jobs in the United States is growing at a rapid rate, but despite the high demand for cybersecurity professionals to fill these positions, females remain significantly underrepresented in the cybersecurity profession. The purpose of this qualitative multiple-case study was to explore the underrepresentation of females in the cybersecurity profession by examining the factors that contribute to the interest, hiring, development, advancement, and sustainability of females in this profession within the United States. The overarching research question asked, “why is there a disproportionately low representation of female workers in the U.S. cybersecurity industry?” This research question was answered by employing a multiple-case study approach that surveyed three distinct groups of individuals. Semistructured interviews were conducted with participants representing each of the three cases, and then within-case and cross-case analyses were utilized to generate themes from the data. The study’s target population consisted of individuals that are affected by the gender disparity in the cybersecurity profession. The sample included individuals that accurately represented the three cases chosen to explore the phenomenon: (a) female cybersecurity professionals working in the field, (b) female cybersecurity students intending to pursue a career in cybersecurity, and (c) male and female hiring managers responsible for filling cybersecurity positions. Thematic analysis of the interview data was conducted both within the individual cases and across the cases to achieve an overall impression of the phenomenon. Five themes emerged from the data analysis, and these five themes demonstrated that (a) cybersecurity professionals’ confidence levels vary based on gender, (b) stereotypes and biases negatively impact females working in the cybersecurity profession, (c) marketing images and terminology associated with the cybersecurity profession are not gender inclusive, (d) early exposure to cybersecurity is key to increasing female interest in the profession, and (e) males hold the majority of gateway positions that influence entry into the cybersecurity profession. These findings can be used by scholars and practitioners to improve the recruitment, hiring, development, advancement, and retention of females in the cybersecurity profession in the United States.;2308204414;Dissertations & Theses;;James, Sturhonda L.;;;" Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.";; Dissertation/Thesis;; 2019; 9781687966742;;; English; English;;;2019;ProQuest Dissertations and Theses;2019;;https://search.proquest.com/docview/2308204414?accountid=11774; 0489 Information Technology; 0489 Information Technology;; 0489 Information Technology;;; 0489 Information Technology; Information technology; cybersecurity , cyber security , diversity , gender gap , male-dominant , women;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:Publicly+Available+Content+Database&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+Underrepresentation+of+Females+in+the+United+States+Cybersecurity+Workforce%3A+A+Multiple-case+Study&amp;issn=&amp;date=2019-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=James%2C+Sturhonda+L.&amp;isbn=9781687966742&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/";ProQuest Central

Unhidden and Unrelenting Figures: The Persistence of Black Women in STEM Disciplines;Black women and girls should be considered when stories of success are highlighted for aspiring Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math (STEM) students, given the essential need for STEM workers in the United States to remain competitive in the global marketplace. Moreover, studies show Black women are just as interested in math and science during their pre-college education as their White and Asian counterparts. The purpose of this dissertation was to explore the experiences of Black women in STEM disciplines who successfully persist and are on course to attaining their STEM degree at four-year universities. A conceptual framework was developed employing Black Feminist Thought (BFT) and the Anti-Deficit Achievement Framework. The experiences of Black women were presented with an anti-deficit approach to focus on their academic achievement and how Black women responded and overcame challenges on their STEM journey. This framework guided the interview protocol to concentrate on systems of support of Black women who persist in STEM and acts of resistance from Black women during their educational journey. The sample included 15 students who self-identified as Black women in one or more of the STEM disciplines and enrolled at a California State University. The findings revealed six themes (financial factors, self-efficacy, familial support, academic support, finding community, and advocacy) and one additional finding (responding to microaggressions) were common aspects that contributed to the success and academic achievement of Black women in STEM disciplines from PreK-12 education through post-college planning in STEM fields. The findings provide a greater understanding of the experience of high-achieving Black women who are successfully persisting in STEM. Based on the results, recommendations are made for the development of culturally relevant STEM-focused programs for Black women and girls, the use of meaning-making pedagogy and curriculum for STEM topics, the recruitment and retention of diverse faculty in math and science subjects for PreK-12 education and STEM disciplines in higher education, and the increase of student exposure to Black women who are professionals in STEM.;2305529698;Dissertations & Theses;;Bryant, Tashiana;;;" Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.";; Dissertation/Thesis;; 2019; 9781687912435;;; English; English;;;2019;ProQuest Dissertations and Theses;2019;;https://search.proquest.com/docview/2305529698?accountid=11774; 0745 Higher education , 0325 Black studies , 0453 Womens studies; 0745 Higher education , 0325 Black studies , 0453 Womens studies;; 0745 Higher education , 0325 Black studies , 0453 Womens studies;;; 0745 Higher education , 0325 Black studies , 0453 Womens studies; Higher education , Black studies , Womens studies; Black women , Counternarratives , Higher education , Persistence , Social sciences , STEM majors;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:Publicly+Available+Content+Database&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Unhidden+and+Unrelenting+Figures%3A+The+Persistence+of+Black+Women+in+STEM+Disciplines&amp;issn=&amp;date=2019-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Bryant%2C+Tashiana&amp;isbn=9781687912435&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/";ProQuest Central
Evaluation of the [email protected] Game-Based Learning–Teaching Approach;The constructivist approach is interested in creating knowledge through active engagement and encourages students to build their knowledge from their experiences in the world. Learning through digital game making is a constructivist approach that allows students to learn by developing their own games, enhancing problem-solving skills and fostering creativity. In this context two tools, Create@School App and the Project Management Dashboard (PMD), were developed to enable students from different countries to be able to adapt their learning material by programming and designing games for their academic subjects, therefore integrating the game mechanics, dynamics, and aesthetics into the academic curriculum. This paper focuses on presenting the validation context as well as the evaluation of these tools. The Hassenzahl model and AttrakDiff survey were used for measuring users’ experience and satisfaction, and for understanding emotional responses, thus providing information that enables testing of the acceptability and usability of the developed apps. After two years of usage of code-making apps (i.e., Create@School and its pre-design version Pocket Code), the pupils processed knowledge from their academic subjects spontaneously as game-based embedded knowledge. The students demonstrated creativity, a practical approach, and enthusiasm regarding making games focused on academic content that led them to learning, using mobile devices, sensors, images, and contextual information. This approach was widely accepted by students and teachers as part of their everyday class routines.;2301800631;Scholarly Journals;;"Gaeta, Eugenio;Beltrán-Jaunsaras, María Eugenia;Cea, Gloria;Spieler, Bernadette;Burton, Andrew;García-Betances, Rebeca Isabel;Cabrera-Umpiérrez, María Fernanda;Brown, David;Boulton, Helen;Arredondo Waldmeyer, María T";;; © 2019.

Framework for Software Code Reviews and Inspections in a Classroom Environment;Code reviews and inspections have the purpose to ensure that the code has sufficient quality to be released. It is generally seen as an economical way of finding errors, increase team productivity and sharing technical and product knowledge among team members. This approach is traditionally adopted in software development companies, but their practices may be useful in other contexts, such as in the process of learning software engineering. In this sense, this study proposes an innovative framework for conducting code reviews in a Computer Science course. The proposed framework can be applied in any object-oriented program language, and it is sufficiently concise to be applied in the classroom, namely in a 90-minute session in which all students are invited to collaborate in this process. The findings suggest that code reviews in an academic context can help students to strategically reflect about the performed work, enhance their soft skills, and increase their ability to work in groups. On the other hand, as the main challenges, the findings reveal that students typically don’t have previous experience in performing inspections and it can become difficult to perform a complete inspection in a classroom session.;2150550661;Scholarly Journals;;Almeida, Fernando;;; © 2018.

Computational Thinking Relationship with Digital Competence;"The European Commission Science Hub has been promoting Computational Thinking (CT) as an important 21st century skill or competence. However, ""despite the high interest in developing computational thinking among schoolchildren and the large public and private investment in CT initiatives, there are a number of issues and challenges for the integration of CT in the school curricula"". On the other hand, the Digital Competence (DC) Framework 2.0 (DigCom) is promoted in the same European Commission Science Hub portal. It shows that both topics have many things in common. Thus, there is the need of research on the relationship between CT and digital competence. The goal of this paper is to analyse and discuss the relationship between DC and CT, and to help educators as well as educational policy makers to make informed decisions about how CT and DC can be included in their local institutions. We begin by defining DC and CT and then discuss the current state of both phenomena in education in multiple countries in Europe. By analysing official documents, we try to find the underlying commonness in both DC and CT, and discover all possible connections between them. Possible interconnections between the component groups of approaches are presented in Fig.";2209645676;Scholarly Journals;;"Juškevičienė, Anita;Dagienė, Valentina";;" European Commission

Context and user needs in virtual learning in pursuit of qualities of learning;Learning is integral in the present dynamic environment characterized by factors, such as intense technological innovation and global economy. Thus, learning is constantly required as, for example, rapid development of technologies is both a push factor in learning requirements and a vehicle to advance the learning process. The global nature of the environment today calls for virtual learning because of convenience, time and cost factors. This research seeks to draw measures to promote virtual learning experience . The research is based on a virtual learning of a master’s level information and communication technology for development (ICT4D) course at the University of Tampere in 2016. This course was offered two times and to two sets of different student groups. A questionnaire was conducted at the mid-course stage to assess the virtual learning experience and propose the ways to improve learning process. The assessment included how well the virtual environment and pedagogy promoted qualities of learning, these are, active, constructive, collaborative, intentional, contextual, transfer and reflective learning. Excellence in learning should always be promoted and in virtual environment, there is always new opportunities because of the advances in technology. This research seeks to promote qualities of learning by considering context in terms of assessing the learning environment that is, participants’ virtual learning experience, study contents and learning technologies. Context is important in order to map the learning process that suits the learners and study contents. The results of this study include highlighting of pedagogical techniques and technological tools that fit the learners’ and study content requirements to foster learning in a virtual environment.;1992852420;Scholarly Journals; University of Tampere, Tampere, Finland , University of Tampere, Tampere, Finland;"Mavengere, Nicholas;Ruohonen, Mikko";;; Education and Information Technologies is a copyright of Springer, (2018).

The effect of requests for user feedback on Quality of Experience;"Companies are interested in knowing how users experience and perceive their products. Quality of Experience (QoE) is a measurement that is used to assess the degree of delight or annoyance in experiencing a software product. To assess QoE, we have used a feedback tool integrated into a software product to ask users about their QoE ratings and to obtain information about their rationales for good or bad QoEs. It is known that requests for feedback may disturb users; however, little is known about the subjective reasoning behind this disturbance or about whether this disturbance negatively affects the QoE of the software product for which the feedback is sought. In this paper, we present a mixed qualitative-quantitative study with 35 subjects that explore the relationship between feedback requests and QoE. The subjects experienced a requirement-modeling mobile product, which was integrated with a feedback tool. During and at the end of the experience, we collected the users’ perceptions of the product and the feedback requests. Based on the users’ rational for being disturbed by the feedback requests, such as “early feedback,” “interruptive requests,” “frequent requests,” and “apparently inappropriate content,” we modeled feedback requests. The model defines feedback requests using a set of five-tuple variables: “task,” “timing” of the task for issuing the feedback requests, user’s “expertise-phase” with the product, the “frequency” of feedback requests about the task, and the “content” of the feedback request. Configuration of these parameters might drive the participants’ perceived disturbances. We also found that the disturbances generated by triggering user feedback requests have negligible impacts on the QoE of software products. These results imply that software product vendors may trust users’ feedback even when the feedback requests disturb the users.";2046474802;Scholarly Journals;" Blekinge Institute of Technology, Karlskrona, Sweden; School of Engineering, University of Applied Science and Arts Northwestern Switzerland FHNW, Windisch, Switzerland , Blekinge Institute of Technology, Karlskrona, Sweden; School of Engineering, University of Applied Science and Arts Northwestern Switzerland FHNW, Windisch, Switzerland , Blekinge Institute of Technology, Karlskrona, Sweden";"Fotrousi, Farnaz;Fricker, Samuel A;Fiedler, Markus";;; Software Quality Journal is a copyright of Springer, (2017).

Exploring Power Distribution and Its Influence on the Process of Argumentation in a POGIL Biochemistry Classroom;In this exploratory case study, we consider how students in an undergraduate biochemistry class engaged in the process of argumentation within an inquiryoriented learning environment to investigate a chemical mechanism in a particular part of the tricarboxylic acid cycle. Audio/video recordings of student groups during the mechanism discussion were analyzed in a coordinated fashion using three coding frameworks. The first framework examined students 'pattern of argumentation using Toulmin's Argumentation Pattern model, the second coded the interactions for discursive moves using the Inquiry-Oriented Discursive Moves framework, and the final analysis phase used turn-at-talk counts as a framework to explore how power and authority shift between and among participants in the classroom. This research found that argumentation is supported by structures that provide opportunities for discussion, claims, and rebuttals but that the instructor, acting in nuanced ways through expressions of discursive moves, can also promote or inhibit the argumentative process. We provide suggestions for pedagogical moves in inquiry-oriented classrooms.;2012852927;Scholarly Journals;;"Prince, Annabel N;Pitts, Wesley B;Parkin, David W";;" National Research Council

Evolution in Student Perceptions of a Flipped Classroom in a Computer Programming Course;"The ""flipped classroom"" pedagogical approach is used for a combined undergraduate and graduate computer programming course in meteorology. Details of how the course was flipped are discussed, as well as how student perceptions of the approach, which were gathered from qualitative feedback collected throughout the semester, evolved. Overall, students were largely supportive of using the flipped classroom and remained so throughout the semester. The availability of resources, including the textbook, online videos, and classroom collaboration, was cited as a key component of students being able to succeed. Working through assignments in a collaborative manner with the assistance of other students and the instructor also contributed to the majority of students perceiving the flipped classroom as being effective for their learning. A small number felt the approach was ineffective and expressed a desire for a lecture component; in fact, an increasing number of students identified a need for a brief lecture in class, particularly for more advanced programming topics covered toward the end of the semester. Although there were challenges for students, many felt that the flipped classroom improved their critical thinking skills and gave them confidence to apply computer programming as an analysis tool outside of the classroom.";2012851562;Scholarly Journals;;Davenport, Casey E;;" Journal of Engineering Education

Saudi College Students’ Attitudes towards Online Collaborative Learning;"Online learning has the potential to expand collaborative learning and teaching. It has tremendous potential in the educational field, as it allows people to access computing services to share and edit data over the Internet. Yet few studies investigate the growing impacts of online learning on students’ learning skills, such as collaborative learning. This study investigates attitudes, factors, and challenges to adopt online applications by Saudi students at King Abdul-Aziz University to support collaborative learning. The hypothesized model was developed through the Technology Acceptance Model of Davis, and the Diffusion of Innovation model of Rogers. Three hundred and six students participated in an electronic survey (138 female and168 male). The findings reveal the students have positive attitudes toward collaborative learning with their classmates (M = 4.07, SD = .78), and have positive attitudes toward adopting online collaborative learning, (M = 3.96, SD = .77). Of the participants, 60.1% use online applications for their learning, and 69.9% preferred the learning style that mix between collaborative and individual learning style. There was a significant relationship between the overall attitudes of the students (M = 3.96, SD = .77), and perceived usefulness of online applications in collaborative learning (M = 4.09, SD = .68), with r (306) = .774, p = .00. Students reported facing three major barriers to adopt online collaborative learning, which are data concerns (M = 3.86, SD = 1.01), privacy issues (M = 3.64 and SD = 1.22), and security issues (M = 3.47 and SD = 1.19). Of three predictors: age, gender, and education major, none were significant predictors of student attitudes towards adopting online collaborative learning (F (3,302) = 1.32, p &gt; .05). Given that the online applications can be a very useful solution for education, as it may reduce the costs incurred for the purchase of computers, other equipment, and for employing IT people, it is urgent that universities and administrators start implementing this solution.";2279725846;Dissertations & Theses;;Alghamdi, Osamah Mohammed;;;" Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.";; Dissertation/Thesis;; 2018; 9781085583923;;; English; English;;;2018;ProQuest Dissertations and Theses;2018;;https://search.proquest.com/docview/2279725846?accountid=11774; 0710 Educational technology , 0555 Middle Eastern Studies , 0745 Higher education , 0447 Instructional Design; 0710 Educational technology , 0555 Middle Eastern Studies , 0745 Higher education , 0447 Instructional Design;; 0710 Educational technology , 0555 Middle Eastern Studies , 0745 Higher education , 0447 Instructional Design;;; 0710 Educational technology , 0555 Middle Eastern Studies , 0745 Higher education , 0447 Instructional Design; Educational technology , Higher education , Middle Eastern studies , Instructional design; Collaborative learning , Privacy issues , Data concerns;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:Education+Database&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Saudi+College+Students%E2%80%99+Attitudes+towards+Online+Collaborative+Learning&amp;issn=&amp;date=2018-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Alghamdi%2C+Osamah+Mohammed&amp;isbn=9781085583923&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/";ProQuest Central,Social Science Premium Collection
From Traditional to Reform-Based Teaching Beliefs and Classroom Practices of Elementary Science Teachers;The purpose of this mixed-methods study was to examine the relationship between teachers’ beliefs about their teaching and their classroom practices based on interviews and classroom observations across eight elementary science teachers. A quantitative research analysis showed there was a statistically positive correlation between their beliefs and practices. However, only three teachers’ belief categories were coherent with classroom practices. We argue that there is a complex understanding of tension between the two entities. Those teachers with traditional teaching profiles noted that centralized exams and a strict curriculum limited their classroom practices. Implications for this study about the practice of reform-based teaching are discussed.;2247800266;Scholarly Journals;;"Şen, Ömer Faruk;Uğur Sari";;; © 2018.

Connecting Teachers, Students and Pre-Service Teachers to Improve STEM Pathways in Schools;This paper presents an example of collaboration between teacher educators, pre-service teachers, current teachers and school students that had a primary aim to increase student interest in STEM activities through a MakerSpace STEM club, while improving pre-service teachers’ confidence in delivering the Australian Curriculum: Technologies. The benefit of close relationships between universities and schools provides the framework for collaborative learning opportunities for pre-service teachers and school students. University academics were facilitators in the process, managing the external grant application and wider community workshops as well as embedding the activities in the university curricula. The school teachers managed the internal delivery of the MakerSpace club and promotion of STEM activities in their schools. All worked collaboratively to provide two professional development workshops, supported by a grant from the Google CS4HS program. Outcomes of this research demonstrate a student-centred approach to digital technology education. This model of collaboration between teacher educators and schools is replicable and has a positive impact on preparing pre-service teachers to be classroom ready.;2247790984;Scholarly Journals;;"Lang, Catherine;Powell, Greg;Moore, Nathan J;Ibrahim, Fazeela";;; © 2018.

The Lived Faculty Development Experience of Active Duty Military Instructors;"This dissertation used phenomenography as a methodology to explore variations in the lived faculty development experience of active duty military instructors at the United States Army War College (USAWC), the senior service college of the United States Army. This lived experience is one of both warfighting and academia, but little is publicly known and recorded about this experience outside of professional military education (PME) institutions, and about how active duty military instructors in particular develop personally and professionally during their time in the PME environment. Understanding this experience will contribute to the faculty development of instructors in these unique spaces. Document analysis and semi-structured interviews with six active duty military faculty resulted in an outcome space indicating that the lived experience of faculty development for military instructors at the USAWC is influenced by: prior experience as a senior service college student; assignment to the USAWC; prior experience as an educator; military experience; the structure of the program of instruction; interaction with students; and personal and professional development. These categories of description emerged in alignment with themes of intention, orientation, acculturation, and evaluation. As a result of these findings, recommendations are offered relating to faculty recruitment and retention, teaching team dynamics, relational learning environments, communities of practice, performance evaluation, and faculty development programming.";2187144287;Dissertations & Theses;;Hennessey, Megan J.;;;" Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.";; Dissertation/Thesis;; 2018; 978-0-438-88708-4;;; English; English;;;2018;ProQuest Dissertations and Theses;2018;;https://search.proquest.com/docview/2187144287?accountid=11774; 0745 Higher education , 0750 Military studies; 0745 Higher education , 0750 Military studies;; 0745 Higher education , 0750 Military studies;;; 0745 Higher education , 0750 Military studies; Higher education , Military studies; Social sciences , Education , Faculty development , Military , Phenomenography , Phenomenology , United States Army War College;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:Military+Database&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+Lived+Faculty+Development+Experience+of+Active+Duty+Military+Instructors&amp;issn=&amp;date=2018-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Hennessey%2C+Megan+J.&amp;isbn=978-0-438-88708-4&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/";ProQuest Central

The Effect of Gamification on Students' Engagement and Motivation in Three WSU Courses;The purpose of this mixed-method study was to explore the effects of the use of gamification on students’ motivation and engagement in the college environment. The study drew from three theoretical principles: Self-determination theory, new literacy studies, and behaviorism. The study was conducted at Washington State University on two English writing courses and one integrating technology into the curriculum course. Forty-four students and three professors participated in this study over the course of six months. The study followed the guidelines of convergent mixed-method design where qualitative and quantitative data sources were used to ensure triangulation. A total of fifteen participants were interviewed including twelve students and the three faculty members. The qualitative components of the mixed-method design were supported with the selected evidence based on interviews, observations, documentary, and artifactual data. The quantitative data were supported through multiple regression results based on survey in addition to frequency results which were worked in discussion side by side with qualitative components. Game metrics and game scores were incorporated where they were deemed relevant. The main findings of this study were that gamification positively affected students’ learning in their perspective courses. This was demonstrated through their increased motivation to learn, their promoted engagement to participate and collaborate, meeting their psychological needs of competence and autonomy, and their improved appreciation of the task value in addition to task completion. The study showed avatars, quests, and the fun components to be the most effective gamification elements in fostering motivation and enhancing engagement. However, the findings showed that some game features, such as points and badges, had either no influence or a negative effect on students’ motivation and engagement. Gamification, based on this study, facilitated a learning environment supportive of reading and writing literacy skills. Additionally, it fostered a number of desirable behaviors and attitudes in the learning environment such as increased participation, altruism, the desire to try multiple times, and the positive change of beliefs. The study highlighted the need to consider contextual differences among students and professors when applying gamification, specifically in the college environment.;2185933218;Dissertations & Theses;;Alsawaier, Raed S.;;;" Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.";; Dissertation/Thesis;; 2018; 978-0-438-87722-1;;; English; English;;;2018;ProQuest Dissertations and Theses;2018;;https://search.proquest.com/docview/2185933218?accountid=11774; 0525 Educational psychology , 0710 Educational technology , 0745 Higher education; 0525 Educational psychology , 0710 Educational technology , 0745 Higher education;; 0525 Educational psychology , 0710 Educational technology , 0745 Higher education;;; 0525 Educational psychology , 0710 Educational technology , 0745 Higher education; Educational psychology , Educational technology , Higher education; Education , Engagement , Gamification , Motivation;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:Education+Database&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+Effect+of+Gamification+on+Students%27+Engagement+and+Motivation+in+Three+WSU+Courses&amp;issn=&amp;date=2018-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Alsawaier%2C+Raed+S.&amp;isbn=978-0-438-87722-1&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/";ProQuest Central,Social Science Premium Collection
Creating Effective Online Educational Content: An Evaluation Study of the Influences Affecting Course Developers' Abilities to Create Online Content with Engaging Learning Strategies;As the role of online learning in graduate education continues to expand, course developers must have the resources needed to create engaging instructional content. Course content that leverages effective learning strategies is more likely to successfully engage online students so they complete all online coursework. Student engagement not only plays an important role in educating students, but is also a factor in student retention numbers. Organizations that hire course developers must train them so they possess the skills needed to design learning for future generations. In this study, course developers from a large educational technology firm participated in surveys and one-on-one interviews regarding their experience with developing online courses. The Clark and Estes (2008) framework was used to categorize the findings by knowledge, motivation, and organizational influences that affect course developers’ abilities to produce engaging learning content. The study’s findings reveal that course developers instinctually have some sense of how to engage online learners, but they lack the confidence to use that understanding in guiding the faculty with whom they work. The study also found that course developers need training resources, student data, and organizational support to create effective online courses.;2185912466;Dissertations & Theses;;Maldonado, Erika;;;" Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.";; Dissertation/Thesis;; 2018;;;; English; English;;;2018;ProQuest Dissertations and Theses;2018;;https://search.proquest.com/docview/2185912466?accountid=11774; 0727 Curriculum development; 0727 Curriculum development;; 0727 Curriculum development; N.A.;; 0727 Curriculum development; Curriculum development; (UMI)AAI11017265 , Education;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:Education+Database&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Creating+Effective+Online+Educational+Content%3A+An+Evaluation+Study+of+the+Influences+Affecting+Course+Developers%27+Abilities+to+Create+Online+Content+with+Engaging+Learning+Strategies&amp;issn=&amp;date=2018-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Maldonado%2C+Erika&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/";ProQuest Central,Social Science Premium Collection
Post-program Implementation of Integrated STEM Instruction in K-8 Urban Schools: A Qualitative Case Study;"Integrated science, technology, engineering, and math education, referred to as integrated STEM education, is becoming more common in US educational systems so as to meet the need of a growing STEM workforce. As a result, districts, schools, and educators at all levels are developing and engaging in programs which seek to develop the capacity of teachers and increase student learning outcomes in STEM subjects, as well as across subjects. Integrated STEAM education, which includes the arts, is also a common form of STEM programming. Often, educational program researchers investigate professional development design and/or innovative programming and the resulting initial teacher implementation practices and/or student learning outcomes, especially within the growing field of integrated STEM research. However, only a small amount of research has been conducted on interventions or innovations past the funded implementation phase to determine what programming components or practices were sustained. The purpose of the study is to address the need for and gap in knowledge of educational research related to the sustainability of integrated STEM teaching and learning in high-needs urban K-8 school settings following initial program implementation. This study adds to the research on STEM education, as well as sustainability of implementation by determining what instructional practices, if any, from a year-long professional development program are being continued, discontinued, or adapted post-implementation. Participants in this study are K-8 teachers within high-needs urban schools who initially engaged in the EiE: Building 21st Century STEM Learners (B21stCSL) program between 2015-2017 (Cohorts 1 &amp; 2). Specifically, this qualitative study seeks to answer the following questions: (1) How do K-8 teachers in the B21stCSL program approach integrated STEM teaching and learning following initial program implementation? (2) Following the initial implementation year, how is K-8 integrated STEM teaching and learning supported and disseminated in B21stCSL program schools? (3) What are the challenges to sustained integrated STEM teaching and learning in K-8 high-needs urban settings?";2183911262;Dissertations & Theses;;Giasi, Trudy Carnate;;;" Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.";; Dissertation/Thesis;; 2018; 978-0-438-81367-0;;; English; English;;;2018;ProQuest Dissertations and Theses;2018;;https://search.proquest.com/docview/2183911262?accountid=11774; 0515 Education; 0515 Education;; 0515 Education;;; 0515 Education; Education; Education , Case study , High-needs , STEM education , Sustainability , Urban;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:Education+Database&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Post-program+Implementation+of+Integrated+STEM+Instruction+in+K-8+Urban+Schools%3A+A+Qualitative+Case+Study&amp;issn=&amp;date=2018-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Giasi%2C+Trudy+Carnate&amp;isbn=978-0-438-81367-0&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/";ProQuest Central,Social Science Premium Collection
The Use of Contemplative Pedagogy and Practices among Community College Faculty: A Case Study;"This exploratory single site case study, through the use of interviews, content analysis, classroom observations, and student responses, explored the use of contemplative practices among community college faculty. Previous studies showcased positive outcomes, such as reduced stress, increased self-compassion, reduced implicit bias, and other beneficial health outcomes (Bodenlos, Noonan, &amp; Wells, 2013; Caldwell, Harrison, Adams, Quin, &amp; Greeson, 2010; Deckro et al., 2002; Lueke &amp; Gibson, 2014; Neff &amp; Germer, 2013). However, there have been limited studies on the use of contemplative pedagogy and practices at the community college. The purpose of the study focused on (a) community college faculty use of contemplative pedagogy and practices in the classroom, and (b) faculty perceptions of contemplative pedagogy’s capacity to provide a holistic academic environment for today’s community college student. The findings of this study revealed that faculty are an essential component to creating more just, equitable, and inclusive classrooms. Through self-reflection and exploration, faculty can build meaningful relationships and focus on the humanity of their students. Findings also highlighted that, through self-reflection and exploration, faculty were aware of varying classroom dynamics and used contemplative practices as a vehicle for academic inquiry. Recommendations for this study demonstrate that it is imperative for community colleges to provide opportunities for faculty to reflect on their teaching pedagogy through practical professional development. Additionally, community colleges should find ways to help faculty members develop communities of practices to provide space for self-exploration and reflection. This study showcased the positive potential of the use of contemplative practices in community college institutions.";2174566880;Dissertations & Theses;;Blake, Marlon;;;" Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.";; Dissertation/Thesis;; 2018; 978-0-438-81678-7;;; English; English;;;2018;ProQuest Dissertations and Theses;2018;;https://search.proquest.com/docview/2174566880?accountid=11774; 0275 Community college education , 0456 Pedagogy; 0275 Community college education , 0456 Pedagogy;; 0275 Community college education , 0456 Pedagogy;;; 0275 Community college education , 0456 Pedagogy; Community college education , Pedagogy; Education , Community college , Community college faculty , Contemplative pedagogy and practices , Faculty , Higher education , Mindfulness;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:Education+Database&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+Use+of+Contemplative+Pedagogy+and+Practices+among+Community+College+Faculty%3A+A+Case+Study&amp;issn=&amp;date=2018-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Blake%2C+Marlon&amp;isbn=978-0-438-81678-7&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/";ProQuest Central,Social Science Premium Collection
A Mixed Method Analysis on the Relationship between Engagement, Achievement, Satisfaction, and Syllabus Design in a Private Midwest University;Background: Online learning is now at the forefront of education, making a college degree more accessible than ever before. With online enrollments at an all-time high, quality instruction is essential to the sustainability of the institution and ultimately affects student enrollment and retention. Research exists on the effectiveness of syllabus design and the use of inventories, but the gap in the existing literature lies in combining the two. Purpose: The purpose of this mixed methods study was to analyze possible relationships between syllabus design and student achievement, student engagement, student satisfaction, faculty instruction, and faculty satisfaction. Research Design: An Online Syllabus Inventory (OSI) was developed as an evaluative and instructional tool and served as the independent variable for syllabus design between administration of control and experimental courses. Data Collection and Analysis: This mixed methods study synthesized quantitative and qualitative data gathered from 28 online courses and 379 students. Data sources included student analytics from a learning management system, course evaluations from a student information system, and feedback from study participants. Findings: In the domain of student achievement, a significant difference was found between two control and experimental courses. In the domain of student engagement, a significant difference was found in six courses. Among the sample, course-level factors were found to be significantly different in the domain of student satisfaction. No significant difference was found among instructor-level factors.;2173095655;Dissertations & Theses;;Kohler, Hannah;;;" Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.";; Dissertation/Thesis;; 2018; 978-0-438-80846-1;;; English; English;;;2018;ProQuest Dissertations and Theses;2018;;https://search.proquest.com/docview/2173095655?accountid=11774; 0443 Educational evaluation , 0745 Higher education; 0443 Educational evaluation , 0745 Higher education;; 0443 Educational evaluation , 0745 Higher education;;; 0443 Educational evaluation , 0745 Higher education; Educational evaluation , Higher education; Education , Online learning , Retention , Student enrollment , Syllabus design;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:Publicly+Available+Content+Database&amp;atitle=&amp;title=A+Mixed+Method+Analysis+on+the+Relationship+between+Engagement%2C+Achievement%2C+Satisfaction%2C+and+Syllabus+Design+in+a+Private+Midwest+University&amp;issn=&amp;date=2018-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Kohler%2C+Hannah&amp;isbn=978-0-438-80846-1&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/";ProQuest Central
The medium isn’t the message: Introducing a measure of adaptive virtual communication;Media use can be considered as an integral part of virtual communication and thus of present-day human interaction. Nevertheless, research on media use and effects still largely relies on laboratory experiments, treating it as a stable input condition, rather than as a function of human appropriation. In this study, we propose a conceptualization of virtual communication as a dynamic construct dependent on media appropriation, particularly of compensatory adaptation processes. Using longitudinal data gathered from 165 individuals, nested in 34 project teams, we explore compensatory adaptation as a function of communication intensity and physical media richness and develop a continuous score of virtual communication accounting for these compensatory processes. Multilevel analyses demonstrate a significant influence of this communication measure on team performance, increasing over time. These results are discussed with regards to their implications for theories of media use and effects and their relevance for real-life communication processes.;2171660390;Scholarly Journals; Department of Industrial/Organizational and Social Psychology, Technische Universität Braunschweig, 38106 Braunschweig, Germany , Department of Industrial/Organizational and Social Psychology, Technische Universität Braunschweig, 38106 Braunschweig, Germany , Department of Software Engineering, Leibniz Universität Hannover, Hanover, Germany , Department of Industrial/Organizational and Social Psychology, Technische Universität Braunschweig, 38106 Braunschweig, Germany;"Handke, Lisa;Schulte, Eva-Maria;Schneider, Kurt;Kauffeld, Simone";;; © 2018 The Author(s).

Improving User Involvement Through Live Collaborative Creation;"Creating an artifact - such as writing a book, developing software, or performing a piece of music - is often limited to those with domain-specific experience or training. As a consequence, effectively involving non-expert end users in such creative processes is challenging. This work explores how computational systems can facilitate collaboration, communication, and participation in the context of involving users in the process of creating artifacts while mitigating the challenges inherent to such processes. In particular, the interactive systems presented in this work support live collaborative creation, in which artifact users collaboratively participate in the artifact creation process with creators in real time. In the systems that I have created, I explored liveness, the extent to which the process of creating artifacts and the state of the artifacts are immediately and continuously perceptible, for applications such as programming, writing, music performance, and UI design. Liveness helps preserve natural expressivity, supports real-time communication, and facilitates participation in the creative process. Live collaboration is beneficial for users and creators alike: making the process of creation visible encourages users to engage in the process and better understand the final artifact. Additionally, creators can receive immediate feedback in a continuous, closed loop with users. Through these interactive systems, non-expert participants help create such artifacts as GUI prototypes, software, and musical performances. This dissertation explores three topics: (1) the challenges inherent to collaborative creation in live settings, and computational tools that address them; (2) methods for reducing the barriers of entry to live collaboration; and (3) approaches to preserving liveness in the creative process, affording creators more expressivity in making artifacts and affording users access to information traditionally only available in real-time processes. In this work, I showed that enabling collaborative, expressive, and live interactions in computational systems allow the broader population to take part in various creative practices.";2166827533;Dissertations & Theses;;Lee, Sang Won;;;" Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.";; Dissertation/Thesis;; 2018; 978-0-438-59453-1;;; English; English;;;2018;ProQuest Dissertations and Theses;2018;;https://search.proquest.com/docview/2166827533?accountid=11774; 0984 Computer science; 0984 Computer science;; 0984 Computer science;;; 0984 Computer science; Computer science; Applied sciences , Human computation , Human computer interaction , Interactive music , Lice collabroative creation , Live coding , Liveness , User involvement;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:Matericals+Science+%26+Engineering+Dissertations&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Improving+User+Involvement+Through+Live+Collaborative+Creation&amp;issn=&amp;date=2018-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Lee%2C+Sang+Won&amp;isbn=978-0-438-59453-1&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/";SciTech Premium Collection
Three Studies on Student Recruitment and Selection into Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics Undergraduate Research Programs and Internships;The U.S. government, including the National Science Foundation (NSF), makes significant investments in the upcoming generation of scientists and researchers through undergraduate research programs (UR) and internships. These programs are thought to motivate students to finish STEM degrees and provide authentic training under the mentorship of scientists. How are students recruited and chosen for these programs? This dissertation consists of three studies focusing on undergraduate student recruitment and selection into science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) undergraduate research (UR) programs and internships. The first study is philosophical and proposes that gender should be considered a marker of merit in student selection competitions. The essay employs a Marxist feminists position to suggest that women, because of their historical exclusion from science and their oppressed social location, have special contributions to make to the scientific enterprise. The main feminist contribution is social epistemological. Women, under certain circumstances, can detect male biases in men’s conclusion, choice of theory and experimental design. The second study looks at NSF’s UR program, called the Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU). It sheds light on historical patterns of student recruitment and recruitment practices for eleven years of REU funding, 1987 to 2017. In line with federal priorities, individual REU sites have proposed recruiting undergraduate students who are members of underrepresented groups, and, additionally, students from groups that are not mentioned in the REU recommendations for recruitment (e.g., first-generation college students, low-income students). This study makes a contribution by documenting a taxonomy of student recruitment practices, something that will be useful to funders and practitioners. The third study uses a discourse analysis approach to examine how two students were chosen for a summer internship in one department at a government laboratory in the Western United States. Findings show that the two students were selected for two reasons: one for how the internship could assist her career and the other for her potential contribution to the laboratory’s workload. Although diversity was part of the internship’s mission, it was not explicitly invoked during the selection deliberation. These studies contribute to scholarly understanding of undergraduate student recruitment and selection.;2165537267;Dissertations & Theses;;Dutilly, Erik Keith;;;" Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.";; Dissertation/Thesis;; 2018; 978-0-438-76782-9;;; English; English;;;2018;ProQuest Dissertations and Theses;2018;;https://search.proquest.com/docview/2165537267?accountid=11774; 0446 Higher Education Administration , 0515 Education , 0714 Science education; 0446 Higher Education Administration , 0515 Education , 0714 Science education;; 0446 Higher Education Administration , 0515 Education , 0714 Science education;;; 0446 Higher Education Administration , 0515 Education , 0714 Science education; Higher Education Administration , Education , Science education; Education , Broadening participation , Higher education , Recruitment , STEM , Selection , Undergraduate research;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:Education+Database&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Three+Studies+on+Student+Recruitment+and+Selection+into+Science%2C+Technology%2C+Engineering%2C+and+Mathematics+Undergraduate+Research+Programs+and+Internships&amp;issn=&amp;date=2018-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Dutilly%2C+Erik+Keith&amp;isbn=978-0-438-76782-9&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/";ProQuest Central,Social Science Premium Collection
Phenomenological Exploration on the Experience of Microaggression by Women Faculty of Color and Its Relations to Self-Efficacy;"Women faculty of color continue to be an underrepresented population and continue to experience inequality, including microaggressions, in the system of U.S. higher education. However, previous studies have not yet examined the experiences of women faculty of color in terms of microaggressions. Studies of microaggressions in higher education tend to focus on students’ experiences of microaggressions or focus on the singular identity of an underrepresented population, such as microaggresissons toward women or microaggressions toward people of color. Focusing on a single identity almost inevitably obscures and oversimplifies faculty members’ academic life experiences; thus, it is imperative that researchers consider the intersectionality of identities. The purpose of this hermeneutic, phenomenological study is to examine the underpinnings of how women faculty of color experience microaggressions by applying an intersectional approach, and to discover how their experiences of microaggressions influence their perceptions of their self-efficacy as scholars.";2159484913;Dissertations & Theses;;Yamanaka, Aoi;;;" Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.";; Dissertation/Thesis;; 2018; 978-0-438-73859-1;;; English; English;;;2018;ProQuest Dissertations and Theses;2018;;https://search.proquest.com/docview/2159484913?accountid=11774; 0453 Womens studies , 0525 Educational psychology , 0624 Occupational psychology , 0625 Personality psychology , 0631 Ethnic studies , 0745 Higher education; 0453 Womens studies , 0525 Educational psychology , 0624 Occupational psychology , 0625 Personality psychology , 0631 Ethnic studies , 0745 Higher education;; 0453 Womens studies , 0525 Educational psychology , 0624 Occupational psychology , 0625 Personality psychology , 0631 Ethnic studies , 0745 Higher education;;; 0453 Womens studies , 0525 Educational psychology , 0624 Occupational psychology , 0625 Personality psychology , 0631 Ethnic studies , 0745 Higher education; Womens studies , Educational psychology , Occupational psychology , Personality psychology , Ethnic studies , Higher education; Social sciences , Psychology , Education , Hermeneutic phenomenology , Intersectionality of identities , Microaggressions;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:Psychology+Database&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Phenomenological+Exploration+on+the+Experience+of+Microaggression+by+Women+Faculty+of+Color+and+Its+Relations+to+Self-Efficacy&amp;issn=&amp;date=2018-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Yamanaka%2C+Aoi&amp;isbn=978-0-438-73859-1&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/";ProQuest Central,Social Science Premium Collection
A Corpus-Assisted Discourse Analysis of Music-Related Practices Discussed within Chipmusic.org;This study examined discussion forum posts within a website dedicated to a medium and genre of music (chiptunes) with potential for music-centered making , a phrase I use to describe maker culture practices that revolve around music-related purposes. Three research questions guided this study: (1) What chiptune-related practices did members of chipmusic.org discuss between December 30th, 2009 and November 13th, 2017? (2) What do chipmusic.org discussion forum posts reveal about the multidisciplinary aspects of chiptunes? (3) What import might music-centered making evident within chipmusic.org discussion forum posts hold for music education? To address these research questions, I engaged in corpus-assisted discourse analysis tools and techniques to reveal and analyze patterns of discourse within 245,098 discussion forum posts within chipmusic.org. The analysis cycle consisted of (a) using corpus analysis techniques to reveal patterns of discourse across and within data consisting of 10,892,645 words, and (b) using discourse analysis techniques for a close reading of revealed patterns. Findings revealed seven interconnected themes of chiptune-related practices: (a) composition practices, (b) performance practices, (c) maker practices, (d) coding practices, (e) entrepreneurial practices, (f), visual art practices, and (g) community practices. Members of chipmusic.org primarily discussed composing and performing chiptunes on a variety of instruments, as well as through retro computer and video game hardware. Members also discussed modifying and creating hardware and software for a multitude of electronic devices. Some members engaged in entrepreneurial practices to promote, sell, buy, and trade with other members. Throughout each of the revealed themes, members engaged in visual art practices, as well as community practices such as collective learning, collaborating, constructive criticism, competitive events, and collective efficacy. Findings suggest the revealed themes incorporated practices from a multitude of academic disciplines or fields of study for music-related purposes. However, I argue that many of the music-related practices people discussed within chipmusic.org are not apparent within music education discourse, curricula, or standards. I call for an expansion of music education discourse and practices to include additional ways of being musical through practices that might borrow from multiple academic disciplines or fields of study for music-related purposes.;2154870828;Dissertations & Theses;;O'Leary, Jared Duane;;;" Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.";; Dissertation/Thesis;; 2018; 978-0-438-71945-3;;; English; English;;;2018;ProQuest Dissertations and Theses;2018;;https://search.proquest.com/docview/2154870828?accountid=11774; 0515 Education , 0522 Music education , 0727 Curriculum development; 0515 Education , 0522 Music education , 0727 Curriculum development;; 0515 Education , 0522 Music education , 0727 Curriculum development;;; 0515 Education , 0522 Music education , 0727 Curriculum development; Education , Music education , Curriculum development; Education , Chiptune , Interdisciplinary , Interdiscipline , Multidisciplinary , Music-centered making , Transdisciplinary;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:Education+Database&amp;atitle=&amp;title=A+Corpus-Assisted+Discourse+Analysis+of+Music-Related+Practices+Discussed+within+Chipmusic.org&amp;issn=&amp;date=2018-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=O%27Leary%2C+Jared+Duane&amp;isbn=978-0-438-71945-3&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/";ProQuest Central,Social Science Premium Collection
The Impact of a Gamified Orientation on Predominantly Underrepresented Minority, Undergraduate Student Success and Retention in a STEM Academy Program;An ongoing concern at institutions of higher education is persistence among underrepresented minority students in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) programs. This qualitative exploratory case study was designed to investigate whether combining two strategies, orientations and gamification, to provide more supports for minority students would result in greater persistence and whether the benefits of a traditional orientation were shown, or even amplified, with the implementation of a game-based orientation program. The research encompassed student attitudes and retention rates, with particular focus on the support of building communities of practice, as well as student motivation to complete game challenges. The participants consisted of 26 sophomores, who were selected for the inaugural year of a STEM Success Academy at an urban university. To “gamify” the orientation, a mobile application was developed using a platform called Social Scavenger. Elements of gamification (i.e., virtual scavenger hunts, trivia games, points, leaderboards, teams, and photo and video challenges) were incorporated into the app for use during the orientation program. The primary data collection methods were in-depth interviews with students and program coordinators and a focus group session with a group of six participants from the STEM program. Supportive methods included documentation and archival records. The data was coded and classified according to the research questions. Analysis and interpretation of findings were organized into analytic categories to detail conclusions based on the discoveries of the study. Findings indicated that students and coordinators felt that the gamified orientation treatment resulted in a smoother integration into the college program. The formation of communities of practice seemed to be the most valuable support that was developed through the game challenges. High levels of intrinsic motivation to complete the challenges were reported, with all participants expressing that this style of orientation program should be continued. There was a significantly high retention rate of 96% among the STEM students, and the gamified orientation seems to be a contributing factor based on the qualitative results.;2151426668;Dissertations & Theses;;Vanyi, Jennifer;;;" Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.";; Dissertation/Thesis;; 2018; 978-0-438-70625-5;;; English; English;;;2018;ProQuest Dissertations and Theses;2018;;https://search.proquest.com/docview/2151426668?accountid=11774; 0446 Higher Education Administration , 0710 Educational technology , 0714 Science education , 0745 Higher education; 0446 Higher Education Administration , 0710 Educational technology , 0714 Science education , 0745 Higher education;; 0446 Higher Education Administration , 0710 Educational technology , 0714 Science education , 0745 Higher education;;; 0446 Higher Education Administration , 0710 Educational technology , 0714 Science education , 0745 Higher education; Higher Education Administration , Educational technology , Science education , Higher education; Education , Gamification , Orientations , Persistence , Retention , STEM , Underrepresented minorities;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:Education+Database&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+Impact+of+a+Gamified+Orientation+on+Predominantly+Underrepresented+Minority%2C+Undergraduate+Student+Success+and+Retention+in+a+STEM+Academy+Program&amp;issn=&amp;date=2018-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Vanyi%2C+Jennifer&amp;isbn=978-0-438-70625-5&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/";ProQuest Central,Social Science Premium Collection
Thinking Perspective Profiles as a Predictor of Intelligence Analysts' Job Performance;"Empirical research has supported the use of general cognitive ability to predict employee performance; however, studies have accounted for only a fraction of the variance. The current study addressed whether intellectual styles, which describe how individuals habitually acquire and use information, account for a significant portion of the variance in job performance not covered by general cognitive ability. The study followed a quantitative, nonexperimental design with a convenience sample of 77 intelligence analysts from 6 U.S. government agencies and 2 online professional groups. MindTime provided the primary theoretical framework. The International Cognitive Ability Resource, MindTime Profile Inventory™, and Self-Rated Analytic Job Performance Assessment were used to measure general cognitive ability and analytic job performance. Results of multiple linear regression analysis indicated that thinking perspectives profiles are valid predictors of job performance and contribute to the incremental validity of general cognitive ability as a predictor of analytic job performance. However, because of the high degree of collinearity, results were inconclusive. The findings add to the understanding of the relationship between intellectual styles and job performance of knowledge workers, and they reinforce links between industrial-organizational psychology and cognitive psychology.";2133019381;Dissertations & Theses;;Rasmussen, Curtis M.;;;" Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.";; Dissertation/Thesis;; 2018; 978-0-438-39447-6;;; English; English;;;2018;ProQuest Dissertations and Theses;2018;;https://search.proquest.com/docview/2133019381?accountid=11774; 0621 Psychology , 0624 Occupational psychology , 0633 Cognitive psychology; 0621 Psychology , 0624 Occupational psychology , 0633 Cognitive psychology;; 0621 Psychology , 0624 Occupational psychology , 0633 Cognitive psychology;;; 0621 Psychology , 0624 Occupational psychology , 0633 Cognitive psychology; Psychology , Occupational psychology , Cognitive psychology; Psychology , Analyst , Cognitive ability , Intellectual styles , Job perfomance , Mindtime theory , Temporal thinking;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:Psychology+Database&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Thinking+Perspective+Profiles+as+a+Predictor+of+Intelligence+Analysts%27+Job+Performance&amp;issn=&amp;date=2018-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Rasmussen%2C+Curtis+M.&amp;isbn=978-0-438-39447-6&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/";ProQuest Central
The Implementation of a Middle School One-to-one Technology Initiative: A Longitudinal Study of Teachers' Perceptions of Technology and Self-efficacy;Teachers’ self-efficacy has been identified as one of the most important factors in determining the success of new initiatives. With the rapid technological changes of the 21st century, it’s imperative to have teachers that are adaptive to change. This study was designed to determine the extent of teachers’ self-efficacy in the classroom when it comes to integrating technology in the classroom and teachers’ perceptions of the value of technology devices. This study examined the level of teachers’ technology self-efficacy and perceptions of technology devices in the beginning and end of the 2017-2018 school year at a rural middle school in southern New Jersey. The researcher used the Computer Technology Integration Survey and the Digital Devices and Educating the Whole Student Instrument to identify teachers’ technology self-efficacy levels and teachers’ perceptions of the value of technology devices in academic and non-academic areas. The survey was administered in October 2017 and June 2018 through Google Forms to determine if there was a change in teachers’ technology self-efficacy and/or teachers’ perceptions of technology devices. The results suggested that there was a relatively high level of teachers’ technology self-efficacy at the beginning of the 1:1 initiative and that increased in many areas throughout the course of the school year. Teachers’ perceptions of technology devices also indicated change as teachers tended to view the devices as beneficial for achieving academic goals while losing confidence in devices for non-academic statements.;2130935701;Dissertations & Theses;;Slusher, Adam J.;;;" Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.";; Dissertation/Thesis;; 2018; 978-0-438-59306-0;;; English; English;;;2018;ProQuest Dissertations and Theses;2018;;https://search.proquest.com/docview/2130935701?accountid=11774; 0515 Education , 0710 Educational technology; 0515 Education , 0710 Educational technology;; 0515 Education , 0710 Educational technology;;; 0515 Education , 0710 Educational technology; Education , Educational technology; Education , 1:1 , Chromebook , One-to-one , Self-efficacy , Technology perception;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:Education+Database&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+Implementation+of+a+Middle+School+One-to-one+Technology+Initiative%3A+A+Longitudinal+Study+of+Teachers%27+Perceptions+of+Technology+and+Self-efficacy&amp;issn=&amp;date=2018-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Slusher%2C+Adam+J.&amp;isbn=978-0-438-59306-0&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/";ProQuest Central,Social Science Premium Collection
Engaging the Gatekeepers: Empowering Male Collegians to Promote Gender Equity in Engineering;"Improving collegiate women's access to and retention in engineering requires a multifaceted approach. Though a majority of existing interventions are aimed at changing women, strengthening their skills, and increasing their networks, little emphasis is directed at addressing the institutional factors that influence women's opportunities for advancement (Cook &amp; Glass, 2014; Ely, Ibarra, &amp; Kolb, 2011). From a social justice perspective, research has demonstrated that allies, those from the dominant social group who understand the inequity placed on those in the minority, can be critical in addressing climate issues and promoting inclusivity (Harris &amp; Edwards, 2010; Munin &amp; Speight, 2010). Allies in Engineering (AIE) was created as a cohort of twelve male undergraduate and graduate engineering students who engaged in a co-curricular social justice education program over a period of one academic year designed to promote gender equity in an Engineering College (EC). Rather than situate responsibility for change solely with women (Lynch &amp; Nowosenetz, 2009; Schäfer, 2006), AIE was developed as a means of harnessing majority support, in this case males, as advocates for equity. While participating in social justice education focused on topics such as gender inequality, implicit bias, microaggressions, and systems of oppression, AIE cohort members were equipped to act as advocates and allies specifically for women in the EC, but also for other underrepresented groups. Through programming and outreach, this cohort also educated other EC community members, particularly men, on the importance of gender and other forms of equity. The methodological approach guiding this research was case study. The AIE cohort, inclusive of program sponsors (faculty and administrators) and archival materials, formed the unit of analysis, providing a structure for the collection and evaluation of data in this study. Analysis of AIE alumni focus group data, program sponsor interview data, and archival materials encompassed narratives of the collective and were examined through the lens of Weick's (1995) seven elements of sensemaking to better understand the overall impact of the AIE program on participants. The focus of this study was to understand how the male cohort members as well as the sponsors of the program made sense of the initiative and of their roles as advocates and allies for gender equity in the EC. What emerged from this study was both larger and smaller than the capacity of one engineering college to effect change. The worldviews of several cohort members were reported to have been altered as a result of AIE. These students are now taking expanded views of inclusive environments and practices into their workplaces and into their adult lives, the impact of which will not be fully known for quite some time, if ever. Conversely, the majority of participants in this study, both students and program sponsors, agreed that the AIE initiative likely did not impact the climate of the EC in significant ways. While the program sponsors worked to make sense of the initiative, their basic views remained the same from the start of the program until the time of this study.";2125437061;Dissertations & Theses;;Shoger, Suzanne Grassel;;;" Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.";; Dissertation/Thesis;; 2018; 978-0-438-39118-5;;; English; English;;;2018;ProQuest Dissertations and Theses;2018;;https://search.proquest.com/docview/2125437061?accountid=11774; 0446 Higher Education Administration , 0449 Educational leadership , 0453 Womens studies , 0733 Gender studies , 0745 Higher education; 0446 Higher Education Administration , 0449 Educational leadership , 0453 Womens studies , 0733 Gender studies , 0745 Higher education;; 0446 Higher Education Administration , 0449 Educational leadership , 0453 Womens studies , 0733 Gender studies , 0745 Higher education;;; 0446 Higher Education Administration , 0449 Educational leadership , 0453 Womens studies , 0733 Gender studies , 0745 Higher education; Higher Education Administration , Educational leadership , Womens studies , Gender studies , Higher education; Social sciences , Education , Allies , Diversity , Engineering education , Gender , Gender equity;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:Education+Database&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Engaging+the+Gatekeepers%3A+Empowering+Male+Collegians+to+Promote+Gender+Equity+in+Engineering&amp;issn=&amp;date=2018-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Shoger%2C+Suzanne+Grassel&amp;isbn=978-0-438-39118-5&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/";ProQuest Central,Social Science Premium Collection
The Impact of Active Learning Instruction Based upon Constructivist Theory for Recreational Therapy Undergraduate Students;"Over the last 35 years there has shown a greater interest among higher education professionals to adapt the principles of active learning in their classrooms. Active learning is an instructional approach that allows students the opportunity to participate in the process of learning and requires them to do something more than just passively receive instruction. Increased student engagement, participation and learning have long been linked with active learning, but little is known about any additional benefits. In addition, many researchers have identified that students have negative perceptions association with active learning. The vast majority of active learning research has occurred primarily in STEM courses. No research has been done on the impact active learning can have on recreational therapy (RT) education, a profession that has called for an increase in the quality of their undergraduate education. Therefore there were three main aims of research for this dissertation: 1. to determine if utilizing an active learning based instruction delivery method, grounded in constructivist theory, would result in an increase in student comprehension among RT undergraduate students; 2. to identify and examine any additional benefits associated with active learning above and beyond those of increased engagement, participation and learning; 3. to determine if using active learning tasks and techniques would positively change student perceptions of active learning. Participants were a sample of 45 RT students enrolled in an RT undergraduate course. Students were randomly assigned to one of two sections: active learning or traditional lecture. Student grades were compared through independent samples t-test to determine changes in student comprehension. Benefits of active learning and student perceptions were measured through the Active Learning Classroom Student Survey. Results indicate that active learning has a greater impact on increasing RT student comprehension than traditional lecture. Results also show that in addition to engagement, participation, and learning, active learning also promotes increases in communication &amp; interactivity, community &amp; connectedness, satisfaction and flexibility. Finally, this research also shows that active learning tasks and techniques greatly improve students’ perceptions of active learning.";2125058612;Dissertations & Theses;;Allsop, Jared W.;;;" Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.";; Dissertation/Thesis;; 2018; 978-0-438-50832-3;;; English; English;;;2018;ProQuest Dissertations and Theses;2018;;https://search.proquest.com/docview/2125058612?accountid=11774; 0515 Education , 0814 Recreation; 0515 Education , 0814 Recreation;; 0515 Education , 0814 Recreation;;; 0515 Education , 0814 Recreation; Education , Recreation; Social sciences , Education , Active learning , Constructivism , Recreational therapy , Student perceptions;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:Education+Database&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+Impact+of+Active+Learning+Instruction+Based+upon+Constructivist+Theory+for+Recreational+Therapy+Undergraduate+Students&amp;issn=&amp;date=2018-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Allsop%2C+Jared+W.&amp;isbn=978-0-438-50832-3&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/";ProQuest Central,Social Science Premium Collection
Perceptions of Students on the Impact of Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics Integration on High School Career Choices;Poor mathematics and science skills are one of the leading challenges for advanced STEM career preparedness. There is currently a national deficit in prepared STEM career interest and readiness. A national decline prompted plans for the development of more rigorous standards. Changes in K-12 education were developed through Common Core and New Generation Science Standards. These changes were expected to better prepare students for post secondary educational opportunities such as college or technical school. This research studied effects of perceptions of the impact of high school STEM classes on career choices in two Tennessee schools that are actively participating in the Tennessee STEM Innovation Network and have actively implemented a STEM program since 2012. There is no evidence of research regarding student perceptions of STEM classes regarding STEM implementation in the state of Tennessee since 2012. According to the results of this study, students’ perceptions between subgroups showed no statistical significance regarding readiness or interest in STEM regarding college and career. The subgroups studied included race/culture, gender, classification by grade, and school attended.;2124444634;Dissertations & Theses;;Jones, Catherine A.;;;" Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.";; Dissertation/Thesis;; 2018; 978-0-438-47524-3;;; English; English;;;2018;ProQuest Dissertations and Theses;2018;;https://search.proquest.com/docview/2124444634?accountid=11774; 0514 Educational administration , 0533 Secondary education , 0790 Systems science; 0514 Educational administration , 0533 Secondary education , 0790 Systems science;; 0514 Educational administration , 0533 Secondary education , 0790 Systems science;;; 0514 Educational administration , 0533 Secondary education , 0790 Systems science; Educational administration , Secondary education , Systems science; Applied sciences , Education , Career choice , Public schools , STEM education , Student characteristics , Student preparedness;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:Publicly+Available+Content+Database&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Perceptions+of+Students+on+the+Impact+of+Science%2C+Technology%2C+Engineering%2C+and+Mathematics+Integration+on+High+School+Career+Choices&amp;issn=&amp;date=2018-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Jones%2C+Catherine+A.&amp;isbn=978-0-438-47524-3&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/";ProQuest Central
Teaching movement science with full-body motion capture in an undergraduate liberal arts psychology class: Association for Learning Technology Journal;Movement science is a field that is quickly growing in its scope, leaning heavily on psychological expertise for research design with human participants but requiring computational and engineering ability. Undergraduate psychology curricula are in a unique position to train some of its future scholars. This report reviews an attempt to pilot a class on motion capture for undergraduate psychology students. Recent developments in motion-capture technology have opened up the opportunity for giving hands-on experience with high-quality motion capture for students at liberal-arts colleges with leaner research budgets. Post-course responses to the Research on Integrated Science Curriculum (RISC) survey demonstrated that our students made significantly large gains in their ability to organise an empirical approach to study a complex problem with no clear solution, and to collect and analyse data to produce a coherent insight about that problem. Students may benefit from incorporating motion capture into their undergraduate psychology curriculum.;2121428877;Scholarly Journals;;"Yao, Shengwei;Queathem, Elizabeth;Neville, David;Kelty-Stephen, Damian";;" Grinnell College

Students' motivational factors and engagement strategies in constructivistbased blended learning environments;Student motivation to learn is an essential component for the design, development and implementation of technology-mediated learning environments. Engagement learning strategies have been devised to assist students as they learn in a constructivist-based blended learning environment (CBLE). This study investigates the relationship between students' motivational factors and their engagement learning strategies in a CBLE in Tanzanian Universities. Specifically, the study examines a) student motivational factors to learn, b) gender differences in motivational factors, and c) relates motivational factors with students' engagement learning strategies. The study is built on theoretical foundations of engagement learning and constructivist-based blended learning. We used a self-report student motivational factors and engagement learning strategies survey (SMFELSs) to obtain data from 1010 undergraduate students from three universities. The results indicate that students are positively motivated to learn in CBLE. Our results also reveal that there is a statistically significant correlation between motivational factors and students' engagement learning strategies. The results, on the one hand, enhance our understanding of students' motivational factors to learn in a CBLE, and on the other hand expand knowledge on which student engagement learning strategies should be adopted and implemented in the context of challenging learning environments. Furthermore, the results are important for instructional designers, university teachers and curriculum developers. Our study further helps to improve the design of blended learning courses, constructivist learning environment and learning activities concerning students' motivational factors and engagement learning strategies.;2112556466;Scholarly Journals; Department of Educational Sciences, Vrije Universiteit Brussel, Belgium , Department of Educational Sciences, Vrije Universiteit Brussel, Belgium , Department of Educational Sciences, Vrije Universiteit Brussel, Belgium;"Machumu, Haruni;Zhu, Chang;Almasi, Mustapha";;; Copyright Afrika Focus - Ghent University - BioScience Engineering 2018;; Journal Article;; 2018;;0772-084X;1; English; English; 13-34; Gent;2018;Afrika Focus;2018;31;https://search.proquest.com/docview/2112556466?accountid=11774;;;;;; 13;; Motivation , Constructivism , Blended learning , School environment , College students , Colleges & universities , Teaching methods , Gender differences , College students , Higher education , Motivation , Educational activities , Curriculum development , Student teacher relationship , Learning environment , Learning strategies , Tanzania;;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Apqrl&amp;atitle=Students%27+motivational+factors+and+engagement+strategies+in+constructivistbased+blended+learning+environments&amp;title=Afrika+Focus&amp;issn=0772084X&amp;date=2018-01-01&amp;volume=31&amp;issue=1&amp;spage=13&amp;au=Machumu%2C+Haruni%3BZhu%2C+Chang%3BAlmasi%2C+Mustapha&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=Afrika+Focus&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/";ProQuest Central
How Children Solve Engineering Design Problems: A Study of Design Process Patterns Using Sequential Analysis;The ability to solve problems in creative and innovative ways is more critical than ever in today’s rapidly-changing society. To support these demands, the educational curricula in the U.S. and other countries adopted engineering design as a learning platform to promote students’ creativity, communication and design skills, and innovative problem-solving abilities. When using engineering design, many educators use a variety of engineering design process models. However, little is known about the problem-solving processes in terms of design cognition. Therefore, in this study, the researcher examined the problem-solving patterns of students who engage in engineering design using a cognitive pattern approach. This study was conducted as part of the NSF-funded Science Learning through Engineering Design (SLED) project for elementary science students’ grades three to six. The researcher adopted the sequential analysis method to identify students' problem-solving patterns. Sequential analysis is a statistical research method to detect behavioral or psychological patterns by analyzing repeated cognitive events. The researcher sampled a total of 48 Concurrent Think-Aloud (CTA)sessions to examine the statistical significance of the sequential analysis. Two coders independently conducted data coding using Halfin’s codes and confirmed a high range of inter-rater reliability with 97.22 % overall agreements and .86 Kappa coefficients. The first research question aimed to identify the common cognitive strategies used by elementary science students in engineering design. The researchers pooled 48 CTA sessions to investigate the common cognitive strategies. The results indicated that the students largely concentrated on idea generation (DE) and sketching (MO) while less emphasized on questioning (QH), predicting (PR), managing (MA), and analyzing (AN). Moreover, the researcher confirmed that the upper level graders showed higher frequencies of cognitive strategies than lower graders. The second research question aimed to investigate the common problem-solving sequential patterns of the engineering design process. After pooling the 48 CTA sessions, the researcher analyzed the statistical significances of two-event sequential patterns using GSEQ software. The statistical analysis yielded 14 significant two-event sequential patterns at the right-tailed 0.05 level and two-sided z distribution. Using the significant sequential patterns, the researcher built a pattern-based design process model. The model illustrates various iterations between the problem and solution strategies. The iterations in the problem strategies showed recursive cycles between defining the problem, analyzing, and managing. The solution focused iterations often began with questioning and proceeded to designing and modeling or designing and predicting. Moreover, the pattern model shows that managing and questioning played a key role in bridging problem and solution strategies. The third research question was to identify how the cognitive strategies vary by design tasks. The researcher compared eight engineering design tasks used in the SLED project and confirmed that the structure of design problems was associated with the students’ problem-solving strategies. The results of data analysis showed that the participant students commonly emphasized on Designing and Modeling strategies. However, the researcher found that the modeling-driven design tasks required accurate mechanical designing lead students’ high concentrations on the Modeling strategy. The last research question was to identify the differences of cognitive problem-solving patterns by design tasks. The study analyzed eight engineering design tasks and each task pooled six CTA sessions. The results confirmed that higher graders’ design tasks showed more complicated design pathways than younger graders’ design tasks. Additionally, the researcher found that each design task yielded distinct problem-solving pattern models. Based on these results, the researcher suggested that engineering and technology educators need to highlight the multiple pathways of the engineering design process. The results showed many alternative problem-solving pathways rather than the standardized process models. The researcher also proposed that when adopting an engineering design approach in elementary curriculum, the program developers need to align its design procedure with learners’ sequential patterns of the design process. Engineering design problems provide rich opportunities to develop the cognitive abilities of young students. Additionally, the researcher encourages engineering and technology education programs to adopt multiple design process models aligned with the corresponding design problem types.;2111251015;Dissertations & Theses;;Sung, Euisuk;;;" Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.";; Dissertation/Thesis;; 2018; 978-0-438-36019-8;;; English; English;;;2018;ProQuest Dissertations and Theses;2018;;https://search.proquest.com/docview/2111251015?accountid=11774; 0389 Design , 0524 Elementary education , 0537 Engineering , 0714 Science education; 0389 Design , 0524 Elementary education , 0537 Engineering , 0714 Science education;; 0389 Design , 0524 Elementary education , 0537 Engineering , 0714 Science education;;; 0389 Design , 0524 Elementary education , 0537 Engineering , 0714 Science education; Design , Elementary education , Engineering , Science education; Applied sciences , Communication and the arts , Education , Design process , Problem solving , STEM , Sequential analysis , Technology education , Think-aloud;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:Publicly+Available+Content+Database&amp;atitle=&amp;title=How+Children+Solve+Engineering+Design+Problems%3A+A+Study+of+Design+Process+Patterns+Using+Sequential+Analysis&amp;issn=&amp;date=2018-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Sung%2C+Euisuk&amp;isbn=978-0-438-36019-8&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/";ProQuest Central
Explore the Relations between Personality and Gamification;"Successful gamification motivates users to engage in systems using game-like experiences. However, a one-size-fits-all approach to gamification is often unsuccessful; prior studies suggest that personality serves as a key differentiator in the effectiveness of the approach. To advance the understanding of personality differences and their influence on users’ behavior and motivation in gamification, this dissertation is comprised of three studies that: 1) explore the relationships among individuals’ personality traits and preferences for different gamification features through an online survey; 2) investigate how people with different personality traits respond to the motivational affordances in a gamified application over a period of time through a diary study; and 3) reveal how individuals respond differentially to different kinds of leaderboard experiences based on their leaderboard rankings, the application domain, and the individuals’ personality traits through their responses to 9 dynamic leaderboards. The results from the first study show that extraversion and emotional stability are the two primary personality traits that differentiate users’ preferences for gamification. Among the 10 types of motivational affordances, extraverts are more likely to be motivated by Points, Levels, and Leaderboards. However, the results from the second (diary) study indicate that, after the first week, extraverts’ preferences for Points decreased. The motivation effects of Points and Leaderboards changed over the course of using the gamified application. The results from the third study confirm the findings from the first two studies about extraversion and revealed that ranking and domain differences are also effective factors in users’ experiences of Leaderboards in gamification. Design guidelines for gamification are presented based on the results of each of the three studies. Based on a synthesis of the results from these three studies, this dissertation proposes a conceptual model for gamification design. The model describes not only the impact of personality traits, domain differences, and users’ experience over time, but also illustrates the importance of considering individual differences, application context, and the potential significance of user persistence in gamification design. This research contributes to the HCI and gamification communities by uncovering factors that will affect the way that people respond to gamification systems, considered holistically.";2107988692;Dissertations & Theses;;Jia, Yuan;;;" Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.";; Dissertation/Thesis;; 2018; 978-0-438-34647-5;;; English; English;;;2018;ProQuest Dissertations and Theses;2018;;https://search.proquest.com/docview/2107988692?accountid=11774; 0489 Information Technology , 0625 Personality psychology; 0489 Information Technology , 0625 Personality psychology;; 0489 Information Technology , 0625 Personality psychology;;; 0489 Information Technology , 0625 Personality psychology; Information Technology , Personality psychology; Applied sciences , Psychology , Design , Gamification , Human-computer interaction , Personality;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:Psychology+Database&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Explore+the+Relations+between+Personality+and+Gamification&amp;issn=&amp;date=2018-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Jia%2C+Yuan&amp;isbn=978-0-438-34647-5&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/";ProQuest Central
Transformative Trajectories of First-generation Immigrant Youth Activists;"This qualitative multi-case study examines how four first generation Asian immigrant high school students, who encountered interracial school violence and embraced political activism, tried to make a new life in a large U.S. city under adverse circumstances. A phenomenological study extending over four years, this work functions both as counternarrative to prevalent characterizations of foreign-born Asian urban youth as well as an additional chapter in the writings on youth activism and its implications for not only personal development but for social transformation of minoritized and subjugated communities. In particular, I looked at how political activism affected the lives of these four young people; how they mobilized to effect institutional change in their high school and district; and how their activist identities and literacies came into play as they negotiated the world from high school to college or work. I used as analytical lenses Bourdieusian social theory, critical feminist theory, Freirean pedagogy (1970/2010), and the concepts of social justice youth development (Ginwright &amp; Cammerota, 2002), culturally sustaining pedagogy (Paris &amp; Alim, 2017), youth critical literacies (Morrell, 2008), and activist identities (Campano &amp; Simon, 2013) to understand immigrant youth identity and agency. Methodologically, I employed ethnographic methods such as interviews, focus groups, field notes, memos, and examination archival sources, incorporating the tenets of “humanizing research” (Paris &amp; Winn, 2014) to minimize the distance between researcher and participant. The case studies provide more nuanced understandings of the interrelated dynamics of school, community, family and society at large in the lives of first generation immigrant young people,";2099608232;Dissertations & Theses;;Yee, Mary Peggy;;;" Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.";; Dissertation/Thesis;; 2018; 978-0-438-33918-7;;; English; English;;;2018;ProQuest Dissertations and Theses;2018;;https://search.proquest.com/docview/2099608232?accountid=11774; 0533 Secondary education; 0533 Secondary education;; 0533 Secondary education;;; 0533 Secondary education; Secondary education; Education , Asian community , Education , Immigrants , School violence , Social justice , Youth activism;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:Publicly+Available+Content+Database&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Transformative+Trajectories+of+First-generation+Immigrant+Youth+Activists&amp;issn=&amp;date=2018-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Yee%2C+Mary+Peggy&amp;isbn=978-0-438-33918-7&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/";ProQuest Central
Black Male Engineering Transfer Students: A Critical Exploration of Their Pathways, Racial Identities, and Mathematical Identities;"This qualitative narrative study critically explores the pathways, racial identities, and mathematical identities of the transfer experiences of black male engineering students. Thirteen engineering students between the ages of 21 and 25+ were purposely selected for semi-structured interviews. The participants transferred from various community colleges to a four-year engineering program. This study obtains complementary data from online demographic surveys, researcher observation guide, memos, and field notes. The following research questions guided the study: 1) what are the experiences of black male engineering students who transfer from community colleges to four-year institutions?; 2) how do personal, social, and environmental factors shape the transfer experiences of black male engineering students who attend four-year institutions?; and 3) how do racial and mathematical identities shape the transfer experiences of black male engineering students who attend four-year institutions? The researcher used the constant comparative method to analyze and interpret data, which resulted in several findings. First, the journeys that black male students undergo during their transfer experiences includes successfully navigating the community college transfer application process, engaging with complex engineering coursework, experiencing positive support from family and friends, becoming an engineering student, and making dreams possible in engineering. All these elements must be considered when defining the overall social and academic experience. Second, factors shaping the transfer experiences include social structures that impact engineering student success, enhancing knowledge through communities of practice, and applying knowledge to engineering grand challenges. Furthermore, the students’ identity awareness evolves from their racial identity development, their developing engineering identity, middle and high school academic experiences in mathematics, and their post-secondary academic experiences in mathematics and engineering. Three conclusions were drawn from the findings. First, students’ academic and social experiences revolve around the socialization process that leads to the development of their engineering mindsets. Second, collaborative and mentoring interactions within engineering communities of practice foster the development of their engineering mindsets and complex problem-solving. Third, positive racial and mathematical identities influence the educational participation of engineering transfer students in a positive way.";2092265394;Dissertations & Theses;;Qaqish, Olgha Bassam;;;" Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.";; Dissertation/Thesis;; 2018; 978-0-438-28400-5;;; English; English;;;2018;ProQuest Dissertations and Theses;2018;;https://search.proquest.com/docview/2092265394?accountid=11774; 0325 Black studies , 0516 Adult education , 0537 Engineering; 0325 Black studies , 0516 Adult education , 0537 Engineering;; 0325 Black studies , 0516 Adult education , 0537 Engineering;;; 0325 Black studies , 0516 Adult education , 0537 Engineering; Black studies , Adult education , Engineering; Applied sciences , Social sciences , Education , Black male engineering transfer student , Critical Race Theory , Engineering identity , Engineering mindset , Mathematical identity , Racial identity;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:Matericals+Science+%26+Engineering+Dissertations&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Black+Male+Engineering+Transfer+Students%3A+A+Critical+Exploration+of+Their+Pathways%2C+Racial+Identities%2C+and+Mathematical+Identities&amp;issn=&amp;date=2018-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Qaqish%2C+Olgha+Bassam&amp;isbn=978-0-438-28400-5&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/";SciTech Premium Collection
Design Education at the Secondary Level in the U.S.: Instructional Practices and Perspectives of Teachers;Previous research has found a substantial variation in the conceptions held by teachers about what design is and how it should be learned. Although no two conceptions of design may be alike, one’s conception of design always has consequences. Teacher knowledge of design is of particular importance as what teachers understand about design knowing and learning shapes their instructional approaches to design tasks. In this dissertation, I investigated how U.S. secondary teachers in varying design domains, including computer science, 3-D design, and digital design, perceive how design should be taught and how their perspectives are represented within their instructional practices. The theoretical lens guiding this study was the educational theory of informed design, which posits that K-16 students can become informed designers with instructional support in nine design strategies. Informed designers are neither novices nor experts in design, but somewhere in between. Using multiple case studies as the research strategy, I examined how the instructional practices of design teachers aligned to or diverged from a conceptual framework intended to foster informed design strategies. I conducted multiple interviews and classroom observations of six secondary design teachers within a large U.S. public school district in spring 2016. In my analysis, which included instructional documents and student work, I found that three facets of design strategies were absent from the informed design teaching and learning framework: collaborative learning, peer communication, and the integration of tools/materials. Another finding was that teachers’ perceptions of how design should be taught were informed by prior experiences, as educators with art backgrounds created design projects for self-expression, whereas computer science teachers stressed coding first, design second. Implications include suggested revisions to the instructional framework to encompass social aspects of design and tool use. These findings emphasize that conceptions of design have consequences in how design tasks are approached and in how design is taught.;2092229260;Dissertations & Theses;;Roman, Tiffany Anne;;;" Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.";; Dissertation/Thesis;; 2018; 978-0-438-27168-5;;; English; English;;;2018;ProQuest Dissertations and Theses;2018;;https://search.proquest.com/docview/2092229260?accountid=11774; 0389 Design , 0447 Instructional Design , 0533 Secondary education; 0389 Design , 0447 Instructional Design , 0533 Secondary education;; 0389 Design , 0447 Instructional Design , 0533 Secondary education;;; 0389 Design , 0447 Instructional Design , 0533 Secondary education; Design , Instructional Design , Secondary education; Communication and the arts , Education , Computer science , Design education , Design pedagogy , Instructional design , Secondary education;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:Education+Database&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Design+Education+at+the+Secondary+Level+in+the+U.S.%3A+Instructional+Practices+and+Perspectives+of+Teachers&amp;issn=&amp;date=2018-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Roman%2C+Tiffany+Anne&amp;isbn=978-0-438-27168-5&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/";ProQuest Central,Social Science Premium Collection
Perceptions of Bachelor's Nursing Students Regarding a Flipped Learning Environment for Health Assessment Education: A Multiple-Case Study;"The proficiency level of performing health assessments within nursing units in the United States is inadequate. Educators have not known if students perceive flipped classrooms as effective environments for learning the course material. The purpose of this qualitative, exploratory, multiple-case study was to explore the perceptions of nursing students regarding the observational and active learning processes used in a flipped classroom. The theoretical framework was social cognitive theory. Participants included 14 nursing students in a flipped health-assessment classroom in the nursing program at a university in southeastern Pennsylvania. Open-ended, in-depth, semistructured, one-on-one interviews were conducted with the participants after course completion. Eight major themes emerged from the research questions: (a) The flipped classroom was a good way to learn health assessment; (b) videos and observation of the instructor helped learners see and visualize the health-assessment skills; (c) peer collaboration, including watching and then practicing, helped participants learn from each other and provided reinforcement; (d) active learning made students feel comfortable and confident that they could perform a health assessment; (e) most participants described themselves as visual learners, hands-on learners, or both; (f) the flipped classroom provided good opportunities for practice and repetition of skills, which helped learners retain the material; (g) the flipped classroom involved a great deal of preparation and pressure to learn the material; and (h) true learning of the material took place in the SIM lab and during preparation for the final test-out. Participants believed that the flipped classroom was effective for them in learning health assessment. Observational and active learning could not be separated in the flipped classroom investigated. The participants repeatedly indicated that what they learned in the health-assessment course was a product of “seeing and doing.” Further, the participants believed that observational and active learning were decidedly more effective for learning to perform health assessments in the field of nursing compared to the lecture method. It is recommended that future research include comparisons of several health-assessment flipped courses from more than one university and quantitative or mixed-methods studies involving survey data collected from a larger number of students.";2085355150;Dissertations & Theses;;Pulliam, Norine Dolores;;;" Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.";; Dissertation/Thesis;; 2018; 978-0-438-18092-5;;; English; English;;;2018;ProQuest Dissertations and Theses;2018;;https://search.proquest.com/docview/2085355150?accountid=11774; 0456 Pedagogy , 0569 Nursing , 0680 Health education , 0745 Higher education; 0456 Pedagogy , 0569 Nursing , 0680 Health education , 0745 Higher education;; 0456 Pedagogy , 0569 Nursing , 0680 Health education , 0745 Higher education;;; 0456 Pedagogy , 0569 Nursing , 0680 Health education , 0745 Higher education; Pedagogy , Nursing , Health education , Higher education; Health and environmental sciences , Education , Active learning , Flipped classroom , Health assessment , Nursing , Observational learning , Physical assessment;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:Nursing+%26+Allied+Health+Database&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Perceptions+of+Bachelor%27s+Nursing+Students+Regarding+a+Flipped+Learning+Environment+for+Health+Assessment+Education%3A+A+Multiple-Case+Study&amp;issn=&amp;date=2018-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Pulliam%2C+Norine+Dolores&amp;isbn=978-0-438-18092-5&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/";ProQuest Central
"Building a Better Game: A Theory of Gameful Learning &amp;amp; the Construction of Student Personas with Agency";Gameful course design creates learning environments that support student motivation, drawing inspiration from well-designed games. This dissertation establishes the theoretical framework on which gameful pedagogy is founded. One key piece of gameful course design is that the instructor creates opportunities for students to make decisions about how they will complete course work. Designing these opportunities requires instructors to reflect on how different types of students are likely to behave, and to decide what grade outcomes can be earned through different routes of action. The field of Human-Computer Interaction uses a design tool called personas to help software developers better understand target users and their respective goals as they build new technologies. This dissertation investigates what choices students made within a gameful course, with the intention of developing a method to systematically construct student personas, based on a combination of behavioral, performance, demographic, and psycho-social data. Such personas would ideally enable instructors to more finely tune gameful course structures to student needs. While this research succeeded in establishing a method to describe the pathways students took through the gameful course studied, it identified very little commonality in students’ choices at the assignment level: the 159 students studied took 158 unique pathways through the core assignment work. This finding speaks to the success of gameful course design in enabling students to have autonomy over their learning experience, but, in addition to a general lack of significant findings between basic student characteristics and assignment choice, did not allow for the creation of data-driven personas that felt cohesive and representative of the students they represented. Three goals for future research into data-driven personas are identified: First, to confirm in a larger and more diverse context that the characteristics examined in this study do not have strong relationships to assignment choice. Second, to re-evaluate whether characteristics like ethnicity and gender need to be included in learner personas at all if they do not offer a better understanding of how similar learners are likely to behave. And third, to investigate whether it is more valuable to iterative course design to focus on how different behavior patterns relate to each and impact each other rather than assuming that the patterns themselves will relate to any particular learner characteristic.;2080292528;Dissertations & Theses;;Holman, Caitlin;;;" Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.";; Dissertation/Thesis;; 2018; 978-0-438-12648-0;;; English; English;;;2018;ProQuest Dissertations and Theses;2018;;https://search.proquest.com/docview/2080292528?accountid=11774; 0447 Instructional Design , 0723 Information science; 0447 Instructional Design , 0723 Information science;; 0447 Instructional Design , 0723 Information science;;; 0447 Instructional Design , 0723 Information science; Instructional Design , Information science; Communication and the arts , Education , Course design , Gameful learning;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:Education+Database&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Building+a+Better+Game%3A+A+Theory+of+Gameful+Learning+%26amp%3B+the+Construction+of+Student+Personas+with+Agency&amp;issn=&amp;date=2018-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Holman%2C+Caitlin&amp;isbn=978-0-438-12648-0&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/";ProQuest Central,Social Science Premium Collection
Exploratory Study of the Structured Self Development Experience of Enlisted Soldiers in the Kansas Army National Guard;This exploratory phenomenological research study describes the experiences of U.S. Army soldiers going through the mandated Structured Self Development (SSD) online courseware. Multiple findings are presented covering soldier participants’ experiences with the process, content, and culture/environment of SSD. Additionally, findings dealing with soldiers’ motivations and self-described impediments while going through SSD are presented. Four Army enlisted soldiers (two male, two female) were purposefully selected for this study, each one representing a different level of SSD (Levels 1-4). Participant soldiers for this study were selected from throughout the Kansas National Guard and each one possessed a different duty military occupational specialty within the Army. The findings of the research study indicate that there are multiple aspects of SSD that soldiers experience in a negative way. Areas such as frustration with the system, cheating, poor instructional technique, low retention of information, cognitive overload, and poor leader/peer perceptions were identified through soldier participant interviews. Motivational issues dealing with negative feelings of relevancy and boredom with the instruction were also acknowledged. Additionally, difficulty in accessing the SSD system by soldiers, and over assumptions of soldiers’ levels of self-directed learning were also identified. This research contributes to the ongoing research needed dealing with soldier improvement through online learning.;2068724526;Dissertations & Theses;;Anders, Brent A.;;;" Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.";; Dissertation/Thesis;; 2018; 978-0-438-12351-9;;; English; English;;;2018;ProQuest Dissertations and Theses;2018;;https://search.proquest.com/docview/2068724526?accountid=11774; 0447 Instructional Design , 0516 Adult education; 0447 Instructional Design , 0516 Adult education;; 0447 Instructional Design , 0516 Adult education;;; 0447 Instructional Design , 0516 Adult education; Instructional Design , Adult education; Education , Adult education , Army , Military , Online learning , Structured self development;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:Education+Database&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Exploratory+Study+of+the+Structured+Self+Development+Experience+of+Enlisted+Soldiers+in+the+Kansas+Army+National+Guard&amp;issn=&amp;date=2018-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Anders%2C+Brent+A.&amp;isbn=978-0-438-12351-9&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/";ProQuest Central,Social Science Premium Collection
The Long-Term Significance of Working as an Undergraduate Teaching Assistant;The use of undergraduate teaching assistants (UTAs) has increased in recent years at a number of institutions, especially in active-learning and high-enrollment introductory courses. Currently, there is research demonstrating their benefit to students, and the short-term impacts of the experience on the UTAs. However, no study to date has investigated the long-term impacts of the UTA experience on the participants themselves, and a number of studies call for such an investigation. This dissertation sought to fill that gap in understanding by utilizing a Grounded Theory approach to investigate the perceptions of participants who had served as an UTA in the biology department at a large research institution in the upper Midwest. All participants worked as an UTA from two to ten years prior to the interview, and had since graduated and gone on to careers, graduate school, or professional programs. This research found strong consensus among participants that the UTA experience is overwhelmingly positive. Long-term personal benefits included improved self-confidence, a sense of personal reward, and a sense of community that resulted from working with faculty members. Professional benefits that persisted included a strong sense of professional development, beneficial experiences that transferred to life after undergraduate studies, the ability to explore potential careers, and the opportunity to experience more than just research. Additionally, participants reported that financial motivation was not a primary motivation. Furthermore, they provided evidence that concerns from the primary literature about overly burdensome responsibilities and conflicts of interest with other students were not a significant issue during their experiences.;2063148489;Dissertations & Theses;;Felege, Christopher J.;;;" Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.";; Dissertation/Thesis;; 2018; 978-0-438-06191-0;;; English; English;;;2018;ProQuest Dissertations and Theses;2018;;https://search.proquest.com/docview/2063148489?accountid=11774; 0714 Science education , 0745 Higher education; 0714 Science education , 0745 Higher education;; 0714 Science education , 0745 Higher education;;; 0714 Science education , 0745 Higher education; Science education , Higher education; Education , Experiential learning , Grounded theory , Long term impacts , Science education , Undergraduate teaching assistants;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:Education+Database&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+Long-Term+Significance+of+Working+as+an+Undergraduate+Teaching+Assistant&amp;issn=&amp;date=2018-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Felege%2C+Christopher+J.&amp;isbn=978-0-438-06191-0&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/";ProQuest Central,Social Science Premium Collection
The Effects of Computer-Supported Collaborative Learning on Sense of Connectedness, Sense of Learning, and Overall Sense of Community among High School Students Enrolled in a Marketing Course;"The purpose of this quantitative static group study was to determine the effects of computer-supported collaborative learning on sense of community, sense of connectedness, and sense of learning for students in a high school Marketing Principles course. Sense of community pertains to feelings of belonging and is important to the learning process because it can foster shared positive experiences in the classroom setting. Both collaborative learning and computer-based instruction have been researched extensively and their benefits noted; however, this study is important because it focuses on combining the two into what is known as computer-supported collaborative learning. The independent variable in this study was the type of learning environment, specifically, traditional instruction and computer-supported collaborative learning. The dependent variables were sense of classroom community, sense of connectedness, and sense of learning as measured by the Classroom Community Scale. A series of independent t-tests were conducted to determine any statistically significant differences among the groups. Mean scores for students taught using computer-supported collaborative learning were compared to the mean scores of students taught the same material using traditional lecture-based individualized learning.

Chilly Climates, Balancing Acts, and Shifting Pathways: What Happens to Women in STEM Doctoral Programs;Women in doctoral programs in Science, Technology, Engineering and Math (STEM) leave without finishing at higher rates than men and, as with men, turn away from academic and research careers. This qualitative study examines the day-to-day influences on female doctoral students during their third or fourth year in physical science and engineering programs. Ethnographic cognitive interviewing and online incident reports document the specific experiences and reactions of 28 participants over a six-month period. The data were analyzed to identify key incidents, categories and recurring themes. Some incidents contributed to women’s growing sense of competence, recognition and identification of oneself as a scientist. Others fit a model of microaggressions and gender barriers in a predominantly masculine culture. Problems of work-life balance were demonstrated for some women. Incidents generated responses by some participants that they would disengage from a research-intensive career trajectory toward alternate career interests outside of academic research. The findings provide information about the lived experiences of women in doctoral programs and suggest that the metaphor of career pathways may be more useful than pipelines in explaining the direction of women who are advanced doctoral students in research-intensive fields.;2014718425;Scholarly Journals;;"Cabay, Marilyn;Bernstein, Bianca L;Rivers, Melissa;Fabert, Natalie";;; Copyright MDPI AG 2018; 10.3390/socsci7020023; Journal Article;; 2018;;;2; English; English;; Basel;2018;Social Sciences;2018;7;https://search.proquest.com/docview/2014718425?accountid=11774;;;;;; 23;; Careers , Graduate studies , Graduate students;;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Asocscijournals&amp;atitle=Chilly+Climates%2C+Balancing+Acts%2C+and+Shifting+Pathways%3A+What+Happens+to+Women+in+STEM+Doctoral+Programs&amp;title=Social+Sciences&amp;issn=&amp;date=2018-01-01&amp;volume=7&amp;issue=2&amp;spage=23&amp;au=Cabay%2C+Marilyn%3BBernstein%2C+Bianca+L%3BRivers%2C+Melissa%3BFabert%2C+Natalie&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=Social+Sciences&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/10.3390%2Fsocsci7020023";ProQuest Central,Social Science Premium Collection
“Girl Power”: Gendered Academic and Workplace Experiences of College Women in Engineering;"Women in engineering continue to experience bias in the field. This constructivist case study uses feminist theory to examine the gendered experiences of graduating senior women engineering students in academic and workplace environments. In each setting we identified three subthemes; in academia: “I don’t think my education is any different,” “Being underestimated constantly,” and “You don’t want to be seen as getting advantages”; in the workplace: “Oh, you’re a girl,” “There’s a lot of sexism,” and Benefits of “girl power.” Overall, findings indicate that women experience bias in both settings, often via implicit bias in academia and with instances of implicit bias, sexism, and sexual harassment occurring even more often in the workplace through internship experiences. The article concludes with suggestions for practice, future research, and strategies to create supportive academic and workplace experiences and environments for women engineers.";2002808986;Scholarly Journals;;"Smith, Kathleen N;Joy Gaston Gayles";;; Copyright MDPI AG 2018; 10.3390/socsci7010011; Journal Article;; 2018;;;1; English; English;; Basel;2018;Social Sciences;2018;7;https://search.proquest.com/docview/2002808986?accountid=11774;;;;;; 11;; Girls , Sexism , Bias , Engineering , Women;;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Asocscijournals&amp;atitle=%26ldquo%3BGirl+Power%26rdquo%3B%3A+Gendered+Academic+and+Workplace+Experiences+of+College+Women+in+Engineering&amp;title=Social+Sciences&amp;issn=&amp;date=2018-01-01&amp;volume=7&amp;issue=1&amp;spage=11&amp;au=Smith%2C+Kathleen+N%3BJoy+Gaston+Gayles&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=Social+Sciences&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/10.3390%2Fsocsci7010011";ProQuest Central,Social Science Premium Collection
inverting the large lecture class: active learning in an introductory international relations course;The inverted classroom model (ICM) is an active learning approach that reserves class meetings for hands-on exercises while shifting content learning to the preparatory stage. The ICM offers possibilities for pursuing higher-order learning objectives even in large classes. However, there are contradicting reports about students’ reactions to this kind of teaching innovation. With the ICM making inroads in political science teaching, this paper discusses how students evaluate this method. We report results from an application of the ICM to an introductory international relations course. In our course, students’ reactions to the ICM varied greatly. Using a regression analysis of student evaluation scores, we find that students’ preference for collaborative learning best predicted their preference for the ICM over the traditional lecture format.;1963281538;Scholarly Journals; Institute of Political Science, University of Duisburg-Essen, Duisburg, Germany , Institute of Political Science, University of Duisburg-Essen, Duisburg, Germany , Institute of Political Science, University of Duisburg-Essen, Duisburg, Germany;"Lambach, Daniel;kärger, caroline;Goerres, Achim";;; Copyright Palgrave Macmillan Dec 2017; 10.1057/s41304-016-0078-3; Journal Article;; Dec 2017;;1680-4333;4; English; English; 553-569; Basingstoke;Dec 2017;European Political Science: EPS;2017;16;https://search.proquest.com/docview/1963281538?accountid=11774;;;;;; 553;; International relations , Political science , Students , Active learning , International relations , Regression analysis , Teaching , Students , Learning , Social classes , Collaborative learning , Political science , Learning styles , International relations , Teaching , Reserves , Innovations , Students , Classrooms; inverted classroom , flipped classroom , lecture , active learning , blended learning;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Asocscijournals&amp;atitle=inverting+the+large+lecture+class%3A+active+learning+in+an+introductory+international+relations+course&amp;title=European+Political+Science%3A+EPS&amp;issn=16804333&amp;date=2017-12-01&amp;volume=16&amp;issue=4&amp;spage=553&amp;au=Lambach%2C+Daniel%3Bk%C3%A4rger%2C+caroline%3BGoerres%2C+Achim&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=European+Political+Science%3A+EPS&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/10.1057%2Fs41304-016-0078-3";ProQuest Central,Social Science Premium Collection
Is role playing in Requirements Engineering Education increasing learning outcome?;"Requirements Engineering has attracted a great deal of attention from researchers and practitioners in recent years. This increasing interest requires academia to provide students with a solid foundation in the subject matter. In Requirements Engineering Education (REE), it is important to cover three fundamental topics: traditional analysis and modeling skills, interviewing skills for requirements elicitation, and writing skills for specifying requirements. REE papers report about using role playing as a pedagogical tool; however, there is a surprising lack of empirical evidence on its utility. In this paper we investigate whether a higher grade in a role playing project have an effect on students’ score in an individual written exam in a Requirements Engineering course. Data are collected from 412 students between the years of 2007 and 2014 at Lund University and Chalmers | University of Gothenburg. The results show that students who received a higher grade in the role playing project scored statistically significant higher in the written exam compared to the students with a lower role playing project grade.";1957698408;Scholarly Journals;" Software Engineering Research Lab Sweden, Blekinge Institute of Technology, Karlskrona, Sweden; Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Chalmers and University of Gothenburg, Gothenburg, Sweden , Department of Computer Science, Lund University, PO Box 118, Lund, Sweden";"Svensson, Richard Berntsson;Regnell, Björn";;; Requirements Engineering is a copyright of Springer, 2017.; 10.1007/s00766-016-0248-4; Journal Article;; Nov 2017;;0947-3602;4; English; English; 475-489; London;Nov 2017;Requirements Engineering;2017;22;https://search.proquest.com/docview/1957698408?accountid=11774;;;;;; 475;; Role playing , Students , Engineering , Quality , Empirical analysis , Engineering education , Computer aided software engineering , Skills , Requirements analysis , Students , Colleges & universities; Role playing , Requirements Engineering Education , Requirements Engineering;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Asciencejournals&amp;atitle=Is+role+playing+in+Requirements+Engineering+Education+increasing+learning+outcome%3F&amp;title=Requirements+Engineering&amp;issn=09473602&amp;date=2017-11-01&amp;volume=22&amp;issue=4&amp;spage=475&amp;au=Svensson%2C+Richard+Berntsson%3BRegnell%2C+Bj%C3%B6rn&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=Requirements+Engineering&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/10.1007%2Fs00766-016-0248-4";ProQuest Central,SciTech Premium Collection
The Students' Perceptions of Digital Game-Based Learning;"This paper provides a critical analysis on the rationale behind the utilisation of educational technologies, including; digital learning resources. A qualitative research sheds light on the students' discernment and preconceptions toward the use of digital games, stories and simulations, in-class. Semi-structured, face-to-face interview sessions among secondary school students suggest that students are increasingly acquiring skills and competences from blended learning. Their engagement with educational applications (apps) is improving their critical thinking as it helps them make evaluative decisions to solve problems. At the same time, the results reveal that most of these students are developing their interpersonal skills as they collaborate in teams and work in tandem with their peers, during their formative activities. However, there are also a few students who are not perceiving the usefulness and the ease of use of playing digital games at school. This study postulates that students seem to possess dissimilar skills as they exhibit different learning abilities. The students' gender, age as well as their position in the social strata could possibly influence their disposition to engage with others. These findings imply that practitioners in education ought to consider taking an iterative approach as they identify what, where, when and how digital games are (or are not) consistent with the courses' learning outcomes and curriculum programmes. In conclusion, this paper opens-up some avenues for future research in the promising field of digital gamebased learning.";1967748690;Conference Papers & Proceedings; Department of Corporate Communication, Faculty of Media and Knowledge Sciences, University of Malta, Malta , Department of Psychology, University of Bath, UK;"Camilleri, Mark Anthony;Camilleri, Adriana Caterina";;; Copyright Academic Conferences International Limited Oct 2017;; Conference Proceedings;; Oct 2017;;2049-0992;; English; English; 56-62; Reading;Oct 2017;European Conference on Games Based Learning;2017;;https://search.proquest.com/docview/1967748690?accountid=11774;;;;;; 56;; Teaching , Simulation , Motivation , Students , Computers , Computer & video games , Collaboration , Learning , Curricula , Electronic & video games , Studies , Science education , Education , Skills , Preschool education , Educational technology , Blended learning , Qualitative research , Teachers , Students , Perceptions;;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=proceeding&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Ahightechjournals&amp;atitle=The+Students%27+Perceptions+of+Digital+Game-Based+Learning&amp;title=European+Conference+on+Games+Based+Learning&amp;issn=20490992&amp;date=2017-10-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=56&amp;au=Camilleri%2C+Mark+Anthony%3BCamilleri%2C+Adriana+Caterina&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=European+Conference+on+Games+Based+Learning&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/";ProQuest Central,SciTech Premium Collection
Coding Education in a Flipped Classroom;The main purpose of this research is to determine the influence of the flipped classroom model on digital game development and student views on the model. 9th grade students attending Bilişim Teknolojiler II at secondary level participated in the study. The research is an experimental research, designed according to the pretest-posttest research model with experimental and control groups. In the experimental group, the lectures were carried out according to the flipped classroom model while the control group was taught with the traditional methods in the laboratory environment. As a result of the research, the success of the digital game development and the opinions of the students were favored by the experimental group students who were educated with the flipped classroom model.

Changing the Engineering Student Culture with Respect to Academic Integrity and Ethics;Engineers create airplanes, buildings, medical devices, and software, amongst many other things. Engineers abide by a professional code of ethics to uphold people's safety and the reputation of the profession. Likewise, students abide by a code of academic integrity while learning the knowledge and necessary skills to prepare them for the engineering and computing professions. This paper reports on studies designed to improve the engineering student culture with respect to academic integrity and ethics. To understand the existing culture at a university in the USA, a survey based on a national survey about cheating was administered to students. The incidences of self-reported cheating and incidences of not reporting others who cheat show the culture is similar to other institutions. Two interventions were designed and tested in an introduction to an engineering course: two case studies that students discussed in teams and the whole class, and a letter of recommendation assignment in which students wrote about themselves (character, strengths, examples of ethical decisions) three years into the future. Students were surveyed after the two interventions. Results show that first-year engineering students appreciate having a code of academic integrity and they want to earn their degree without cheating, yet less than half of the students would report on another cheating student. The letter of recommendation assignment had some impact on getting students to think about ethics, their character, and their actions. Future work in changing the student culture will continue in both a top-down (course interventions) and bottom-up (student-driven interventions) manner.;1925068087;Scholarly Journals; Donald P.

Operation STEM: increasing success and improving retention among mathematically underprepared students in STEM;In 2012, Cleveland State University Implemented a comprehensive program, called Operation STEM (OpSTEM), funded by two National Science Foundation grants, federal work study, and Cleveland State University. Its goal is to increase retention and graduation rates among mathematically underprepared Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) students by helping them complete the precalculus-calculus sequence successfully. OpSTEM provides support to all mathematically underprepared students, and it also creates a special cohort of under-resourced students that become OpSTEM Scholars and receive additional supports. OpSTEM Scholars are predominantly freshmen pursuing STEM majors who are members of minority groups that are underrepresented in STEM, first-generation college students, and/ or women. The majority of OpSTEM Scholars begin their mathematics coursework at the beginning of the precalculus sequence. OpSTEM provides these students with many services: a two-week summer institute, mandatory supplemental instruction, project-based instruction, mentoring, STEM speakers, free summer calculus, college success workshops, social activities, and stipends based on participation in these activities and successful completion of coursework. The implementation of the OpSTEM program created an experimental design with two treatment groups, where one group received all the treatments and one group received only mandatory supplemental instruction. They were both compared to a control group from before OpSTEM began. Student data collected have demonstrated that mandatory supplemental instruction alone is effective at increasing the pass rate for precalculus courses, and the additional services and incentives provided to the OpSTEM Scholars group increases the pass rate even further. This is especially significant because the population that received all the services (OpSTEM Scholars) is a population that is more at-risk than the typical population. The ultimate goal of OpSTEM is to increase retention and completion among STEM students by helping them succeed in the precalculus-calculus sequence. Additional time is needed to assess the rates at which these students are completing STEM degrees, but preliminarily data show that OpSTEM Scholars' retention rate is higher than the university's retention rate as a whole and higher than the university's retention rate in STEM fields in particular.;1949081608;Scholarly Journals;;"Carver, Susan D;Van Sickle, Jenna;Holcomb, John P;Jackson, Debbie K;Resnick, Andrew;Duffy, Stephen F;Sridhar, Nigamanth;Marquard, Antoinette;Quinn, Candice M";;; Copyright Institute for SMET Education and Research Jul/Sep 2017;; Journal Article;; Jul/Sep 2017;;1557-5276;3; English; English; 20-29; Auburn;Jul/Sep 2017;Journal of STEM Education : Innovations and Research;2017;18;https://search.proquest.com/docview/1949081608?accountid=11774;;;;;; 20;; Calculus , Higher education , Incentives , Asian students , Technological change , Mathematical analysis , Success , Trends , Engineering education , Mathematics education , STEM education , Colleges & universities , Technical education , Advisors , Secondary school students , Social sciences , Work study , Shortages , Students , Technology education , Calculus , Councils , Student retention , Science education , Work study , Low income groups , College students , Engineering firms , Workshops , Grants , Colleges & universities;;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aeducation&amp;atitle=Operation+STEM%3A+increasing+success+and+improving+retention+among+mathematically+underprepared+students+in+STEM&amp;title=Journal+of+STEM+Education+%3A+Innovations+and+Research&amp;issn=15575276&amp;date=2017-07-01&amp;volume=18&amp;issue=3&amp;spage=20&amp;au=Carver%2C+Susan+D%3BVan+Sickle%2C+Jenna%3BHolcomb%2C+John+P%3BJackson%2C+Debbie+K%3BResnick%2C+Andrew%3BDuffy%2C+Stephen+F%3BSridhar%2C+Nigamanth%3BMarquard%2C+Antoinette%3BQuinn%2C+Candice+M&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=Journal+of+STEM+Education+%3A+Innovations+and+Research&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/";ProQuest Central,SciTech Premium Collection,Social Science Premium Collection
Perceptions of STEM-based outreach learning activities in secondary educationf;  We investigated and compared the learning environment perceptions of students, teachers and guides who participated in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM)-based outreach activities in secondary education. In outreach activities, schools and teachers work together with companies and other external institutions in learning activities in order to motivate students for the STEM domain. In this study, we identified characteristics of outreach activities that explain variance in perceptions of students. Data were gathered from 729 high-school students as well as 35 teachers and guides in 12 activities both in the US and the Netherlands. A questionnaire was used to asses outreach activities based on subscales from validated questionnaires such as the What Is Happening In this Classroom, Constructivist Learning Environments Survey, Classroom Environment Scale and the Learning Climate Questionnaire. Teachers' perceptions were more positive than students' perceptions for most scales, while guides perceived the outreach learning environment in almost the same way as students. Student perceptions were very positive for outreach activities. Outreach activity characteristics such as teaching method and emphasis were found to be the most important factors in explaining variance in students' perceptions between activities. Long-term problem-based activities and the perspective of new views of science and scientists were perceived as providing the most positive learning environments. Additionally, outreach learning environments can create opportunities to increase students' motivation in STEM.;1873285443;Scholarly Journals;;"Vennix, J;Den Brok, P;Taconis, R";;; Learning Environments Research is a copyright of Springer, 2017.; 10.1007/s10984-016-9217-6; Feature;; Apr 2017;;1387-1579;1; English; English; 21-46; Dordrecht;Apr 2017;Learning Environments Research;2017;20;https://search.proquest.com/docview/1873285443?accountid=11774;;; References;;; 21;; Learning , Secondary education , STEM education , Perceptions; Outreach learning activities , Secondary education , STEM , Student perceptions;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Apsychology&amp;atitle=Perceptions+of+STEM-based+outreach+learning+activities+in+secondary+educationf&amp;title=Learning+Environments+Research&amp;issn=13871579&amp;date=2017-04-01&amp;volume=20&amp;issue=1&amp;spage=21&amp;au=Vennix%2C+J%3BDen+Brok%2C+P%3BTaconis%2C+R&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=Learning+Environments+Research&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/10.1007%2Fs10984-016-9217-6";ProQuest Central,Social Science Premium Collection
Flipped Classrooms: a Review of Key Ideas and Recommendations for Practice;  Flipped classrooms refer to the practice of assigning lectures outside of class and devoting class time to a variety of learning activities. In this review, we discuss the range of approaches to the flipped classroom and focus on activities frequently used in these settings. Amongst these, we examine both out-of-class activities (e.g., video lectures) and in-class activities (e.g., quizzes, student discussions). We argue that the value of these activities reflects the particular cognitive processes engaged by the activity regardless of whether the setting is the traditional (lecture-based) classroom or the flipped classroom. Future work should continue to examine the influence of individual activities on student learning and behaviors, particularly when objective measures of learning, such as quizzes and exams, are held constant.;1868601137;Scholarly Journals;;"Delozier, Sarah J;Rhodes, Matthew G"; EPSREO;; Educational Psychology Review is a copyright of Springer, 2017.; 10.1007/s10648-015-9356-9; Feature;; Mar 2017;;1040-726X;1; English; English; 141-151; New York;Mar 2017;Educational Psychology Review;2017;29;https://search.proquest.com/docview/1868601137?accountid=11774;;; References;;; 141;; Classrooms , Learning , Teaching; Flipped classroom , Active learning , Instruction , Review;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Apsychology&amp;atitle=Flipped+Classrooms%3A+a+Review+of+Key+Ideas+and+Recommendations+for+Practice&amp;title=Educational+Psychology+Review&amp;issn=1040726X&amp;date=2017-03-01&amp;volume=29&amp;issue=1&amp;spage=141&amp;au=Delozier%2C+Sarah+J%3BRhodes%2C+Matthew+G&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=Educational+Psychology+Review&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/10.1007%2Fs10648-015-9356-9";ProQuest Central,Social Science Premium Collection

The Impact of Classroom Climate, Support Services, and Instructors' Behaviors on the Academic Success of Military Students': Implications for Change;The city Fayetteville, North Carolina, is historically a military city due to its adjacency to Fort Bragg, which is the world's largest Army installation. It is the home of the XVIII Airborne Corps and 82 nd Airborne Division, and more than 55,000 military service members and over 12,000 civilian personnel. The continuing reduction of forces in Iraq and Afghanistan has led to increase enrollment of military students in higher education in the United States and globally. The first group of student veterans who enrolled in higher education after the tragedy of September 11, 2001 realized that strong institutional support was not available. As a result, the explanatory sequential research design was used to explore, analyze, and compare the viewpoints of military students regarding classroom climate, support services, and instructors' behavior at selected North Carolina institutions of higher education. The research included students, educators, administrators, and staff at two universities and one community college. The participants of the study were 141 undergraduate and graduate military students and military-connected students, and nine institutional leaders of higher education. The study compared qualitative and quantitative assessment of identical on-line survey questionnaires distributed to military students and military-connected students at three institutions of higher education. A follow-up focus group was conducted and the results were aggregated.;2112357771;Dissertations & Theses;;Williams, Molly Noble;;;" Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.";; Dissertation/Thesis;; 2017; 978-0-438-46268-7;;; English; English;;;2017;ProQuest Dissertations and Theses;2017;;https://search.proquest.com/docview/2112357771?accountid=11774; 0449 Educational leadership , 0722 Military history , 0750 Military studies; 0449 Educational leadership , 0722 Military history , 0750 Military studies;; 0449 Educational leadership , 0722 Military history , 0750 Military studies;;; 0449 Educational leadership , 0722 Military history , 0750 Military studies; Educational leadership , Military history , Military studies; Social sciences , Education , Classroom Climate , Military Students , Support Services;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:Military+Database&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+Impact+of+Classroom+Climate%2C+Support+Services%2C+and+Instructors%27+Behaviors+on+the+Academic+Success+of+Military+Students%27%3A+Implications+for+Change&amp;issn=&amp;date=2017-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Williams%2C+Molly+Noble&amp;isbn=978-0-438-46268-7&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/";ProQuest Central,Social Science Premium Collection
CONSIDER: A Novel, Online Approach to Conflict-Driven Collaborative-Learning;"Piaget's classic work on cognitive development showed that engaging learners in critical discussions with peers about ideas that are different than theirs leads to deep conceptual understanding. Implementing such an approach in college-level STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Math) courses has some specific challenges: (a) Short meeting times and large class sizes; (b) Competitive nature of the courses and single answer questions on assignments and exams; and (c) Overall lack of collaborative learning culture where students are unsure of how to seek help and many faculty members tend to think that engaging in collaborative activities may affect content coverage; etc. Based on Piaget's theory, I have developed a highly innovative collaborative-learning approach that exploits specific affordances of web technologies to address these challenges. This approach, named CONSIDER, short for CONflicting Student Ideas Discussed Evaluated and Resolved, allows creation of small groups of students with different ideas about the topic in question, engages them in a highly-structured rounds-based discussion so that the group progresses at an equitable pace, and makes their submissions anonymous to others so that students can receive the comments without any preconceived notions they may have about the poster. While a number of researchers have explored approaches to collaborative-learning, a key difference with this work is that my focus is helping individual students develop their own understanding, whereas the focus of much of this other work is on developing students' team skills, effective communication abilities, and the like. While a discussion in CONSIDER is always among small groups of students, typically 4 students in each group, with each group consisting of students with distinct conceptions of the topic being discussed, the discussion may be organized as either a rounds-based discussion or a forum-based discussion. In a rounds-based discussion, the discussion takes place in a series of rounds, each of specified duration with each student in the group making exactly one post in each round; the student's post is not available to the other students in the group until the end of round; indeed, each student will be able to freely edit her post until the end of the round. The other possibility is to have the discussion organized in a forum-based manner where each student makes as many or as few posts as she chooses and each post becomes visible to all the students in the group as soon as it is made. In addition, the discussion may be either anonymous with the students in the group being known to the others in the group as simply S1, S2, etc., or they may know each other's identities. Since the default setting in the CONSIDER system is rounds-based and anonymous, I will use the term ""CONSIDER-approach"" to refer to this type of discussion. A platform independent responsive web application was developed to implement this approach and to compare it with the forum-based approach. This app was used in three offerings of two junior/senior level undergraduate Computer Science and Engineering courses at The Ohio State University, where one discussion was conducted using the forum-based approach and the other using the CONSIDER approach in each class. Students performance on the pre- and post-discussion question and participation of individual students was measured. In two of the studies, a significant difference was found in the discussion that used the CONSIDER approach, compared to the forum-based approach on both these measures: improvement in learning (Study 1: N =37, r =-.63, p &lt;.05; Study 2: N =26, r =-.38, p &lt;.05) and participation (Study 1: r =-.57, p &lt;.05; Study 2: r =-.76, p &lt;.05). In the third study, there was no significant effect on the post-activity scores ( p =.37), and the participation in the two types of discussions did not differ significantly, either ( r =-.20, p=.09). In an anonymous, optional post-activity survey, a majority of the students self reported that they found the rounds-based structure (55%) and anonymity (80%) to be helpful in their participation and learning.";2019935314;Dissertations & Theses;;Joshi, Swaroop Ravindra;;;" Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.";; Dissertation/Thesis;; 2017; 978-0-355-66219-1;;; English; English;;;2017;ProQuest Dissertations and Theses;2017;;https://search.proquest.com/docview/2019935314?accountid=11774; 0384 Behavioral psychology , 0710 Educational technology , 0984 Computer science; 0384 Behavioral psychology , 0710 Educational technology , 0984 Computer science;; 0384 Behavioral psychology , 0710 Educational technology , 0984 Computer science;;; 0384 Behavioral psychology , 0710 Educational technology , 0984 Computer science; Behavioral psychology , Educational technology , Computer science; Applied sciences , Psychology , Education , Collaborative learning , Computer-supported collaborative learning , Education technology , Engineering education , STEM education , Socio-cognitive conflict;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:Psychology+Database&amp;atitle=&amp;title=CONSIDER%3A+A+Novel%2C+Online+Approach+to+Conflict-Driven+Collaborative-Learning&amp;issn=&amp;date=2017-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Joshi%2C+Swaroop+Ravindra&amp;isbn=978-0-355-66219-1&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/";ProQuest Central
Student-Created Videos as a Language Acquisition Strategy for a Haitian Learner;American schools are becoming increasingly diverse, with an estimated 17 million first- and second-generation refugee and immigrant children residing in the United States. English learners navigate the challenges of learning how to read, write, and speak a new language, all while being expected to stay on grade level. Classroom teachers nationwide are looking for engaging ways to meet the needs of their students, despite resource and budget deficits. The purpose of this study was to explore the role that student-created vodcasts, or video podcasts, may play in the English acquisition of a Haitian learner. This research question morphed to focus on the perceptions and practices of this student’s middle school teacher of English for Speakers of Other Languages (ESOL) in using vodcasting and other technologies to facilitate his English acquisition. A second research question explored the role of sociocultural learning regarding the learner’s creation of vodcasts. Guiding bodies of research in this work included second language acquisition research, particularly regarding identity formation involving brain-compatible teaching, sociocultural learning, and culturally relevant pedagogy (CRP). Data collection occurred between January 2015 and May 2015. The student and his teacher shared their perspectives in six interviews each during the data collection process. Other data sources included 2 student-created vodcasts, 1 created in a group and 1 created by the student alone, a writing sample, and results from the previous school year of the state English as a Second Language Achievement Test (ESLAT). The teacher found that the vodcasts, in combination with other factors, helped the student reflect on his writing, particularly regarding punctuation, and that he overcame an error with comma splices immediately after recording a vodcast. The student found that the practice of vodcasting, in combination with other factors, helped him practice academic language, as required by his teacher for the assignment. The teacher allowed the student to work individually for the second vodcast assignment, and stated that the result was of much higher quality overall, particularly noting an increase in the amount of time the student spent speaking. The data indicated that vodcasting, in conjunction with other strategies supporting language acquisition, might have played a positive role in the student’s progress in his ESOL class. Furthermore, according to both the student and the teacher, independent creation of the video was more effective for him than collaborative group work, which the teacher explained may have had causes rooted in the student’s home culture.;2019911610;Dissertations & Theses;;Thomas, Sarah-Jane;;;" Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.";; Dissertation/Thesis;; 2017; 978-0-355-64924-6;;; English; English;;;2017;ProQuest Dissertations and Theses;2017;;https://search.proquest.com/docview/2019911610?accountid=11774; 0441 English as a Second Language , 0450 Middle School education , 0710 Educational technology; 0441 English as a Second Language , 0450 Middle School education , 0710 Educational technology;; 0441 English as a Second Language , 0450 Middle School education , 0710 Educational technology;;; 0441 English as a Second Language , 0450 Middle School education , 0710 Educational technology; English as a Second Language , Educational technology , Punctuation , English teachers , Data collection , Sociocultural factors , Videotape recordings , Brain , Cultural identity , Collaboration , Elementary school students , Native language acquisition , Immigrants , Reading acquisition , Academic language , Refugees , American English , Second language teachers , Middle school education , Second language writing , English as a second language instruction; Education , Esol , Haitian , Middle school , Video , Vodcast;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:Education+Database&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Student-Created+Videos+as+a+Language+Acquisition+Strategy+for+a+Haitian+Learner&amp;issn=&amp;date=2017-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Thomas%2C+Sarah-Jane&amp;isbn=978-0-355-64924-6&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/";ProQuest Central,Social Science Premium Collection
World Game: An MS Thesis on Engineering Buckminster Fuller's Unfinished Computer Game;My thesis explores the idea that Buckminster Fuller’s World Game is really a formal calculus capable of representing world-scale sustainability problem-solving according to the fundamental principles of a (blockchain) database + (Fuller projection) map + (machine learning) simulation in the form of a game . These computational media comprise an operational formalism which embraces all effective procedures for world-scale problem-solving. If this hypothesis is true, then that would mean World Game’s comprehensive use of the aforementioned fundamental principles are necessary for a sustainable Earth-scale civilization. Furthermore, the protocol for solution formation in the form of World Game “game” is sufficient for solving the problem of “making the world work for 100% of humanity in the shortest possible time through spontaneous cooperation without ecological offense or the disadvantage of anyone”—the objective of World Game. If this hypothesis of sufficiency is true, that means World Game’s principles are in effect synonymous with the process of making the world work. In plain English, a problem-solving engine like World Game is necessary for the survival of humanity, period.;2017323873;Dissertations & Theses;;Pang, Josh;;;" Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.";; Dissertation/Thesis;; 2017; 978-0-355-67044-8;;; English; English;;;2017;ProQuest Dissertations and Theses;2017;;https://search.proquest.com/docview/2017323873?accountid=11774; 0640 Sustainability , 0984 Computer science; 0640 Sustainability , 0984 Computer science;; 0640 Sustainability , 0984 Computer science;;; 0640 Sustainability , 0984 Computer science; Sustainability , Computer science; Applied sciences , Social sciences , Computational media;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:Publicly+Available+Content+Database&amp;atitle=&amp;title=World+Game%3A+An+MS+Thesis+on+Engineering+Buckminster+Fuller%27s+Unfinished+Computer+Game&amp;issn=&amp;date=2017-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Pang%2C+Josh&amp;isbn=978-0-355-67044-8&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/";ProQuest Central
Hyper-connectivity: Intricacies of national and international cyber securities;"This thesis examined the three core themes: the role of education in cyber security, the role of technology in cyber security, and the role of policy in cyber security, the areas in which the papers are published. The associated works are published in referred journals, peer reviewed book chapters, and conference proceedings. Research can be found in the following outlets: 1. Security Solutions for Hyperconnectivity and the Internet of Things; 2. Developing Next-Generation Countermeasures for Homeland Security Threat Prevention; 3. New Threats and Countermeasures in Digital Crime and Cyber Terrorism; 4. International Journal of Business Continuity and Risk Management; 5. Handbook of Research on 3-D Virtual Environments and Hypermedia for Ubiquitous Learning; 6. Information Security in Diverse Computing Environments; 7. Technology, Innovation, and Enterprise Transformation; 8. Journal of Information Systems Technology and Planning; 9. Encyclopedia of Information Science and Technology. The shortcomings and gaps in cyber security research is the research focus on hyperconnectivity of people and technology to include the policies that provide the standards for security hardened systems. Prior research on cyber and homeland security reviewed the three core themes separately rather than jointly. This study examined the research gaps within cyber security as it relates to core themes in an effort to develop stronger policies, education programs, and hardened technologies for cyber security use. This work illustrates how cyber security can be broken into these three core areas and used together to address issues such as developing training environments for teaching real cyber security events. It will further show the correlations between technologies and policies for system Certification &amp; Accreditation (C&amp;A). Finally, it will offer insights on how cyber security can be used to maintain security for international and national security. The overall results of the study provide guidance on how to create an ubiquitous learning (U-Learning) environment to teach cyber security concepts, craft polices that affect secure computing, and examines the effects on national and international security. The overall research has been improving the role of cyber security in education, technology, and policy.";2013953161;Dissertations & Theses;;Dawson, Maurice;;;" Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.";; Dissertation/Thesis;; 2017; 978-0-355-79041-2;;; English; English;;;2017;PQDT - Global;2017;;https://search.proquest.com/docview/2013953161?accountid=11774; 0489 Information Technology , 0790 Systems science , 0984 Computer science; 0489 Information Technology , 0790 Systems science , 0984 Computer science;; 0489 Information Technology , 0790 Systems science , 0984 Computer science;;; 0489 Information Technology , 0790 Systems science , 0984 Computer science; Information Technology , Systems science , Computer science; Applied sciences , Cyberterrorism , Digital crime , Internet of Things;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:Matericals+Science+%26+Engineering+Dissertations&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Hyper-connectivity%3A+Intricacies+of+national+and+international+cyber+securities&amp;issn=&amp;date=2017-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Dawson%2C+Maurice&amp;isbn=978-0-355-79041-2&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/";ProQuest Central,SciTech Premium Collection
Relationship between Project Managers' Age, Years of Project Experience, and Project Success;"Project failures are costly to businesses and are increasingly present in the news. In many industries, projects have a 40% failure rate, and 90% of venture capital projects fail even to start. Project managers play a key role in delivering successful projects. The purpose of this correlational study was to examine the relationship between project manager’s age and years of project experience and project success. The population of this study consisted of 108 active or former project managers working in Albania or Kosovo who were LinkedIn members. The study was not grounded in a named theory; rather, based on the conceptual framework that project managers’ age and years of project experience may predict project success. The independent variables were project managers’ age and years of project experience, and the dependent variable was project success. Data were collected using a questionnaire posted on the SurveyMonkey website and analyzed using multiple linear regression. The results revealed that age has a negative, though not statistically significant, effect on project success. Project managers’ experience has a positive influence on project success; this effect is also not statistically significant. The coefficient of determination R 2 was .02, which demonstrated that only 2% of project success relates to the independent variables. The study may contribute to positive social change by helping project managers and leaders of international development agencies, that conduct project to positively affect social change through improvements in areas such as agriculture, water, sewage, health, nutrition, education, environment, and social development. An increased rate of project success may translate into an improvement of livelihood for local communities in low-income countries.";1994544609;Dissertations & Theses;;Hoxha, Luli;;;" Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.";; Dissertation/Thesis;; 2017; 978-0-355-56841-7;;; English; English;;;2017;ProQuest Dissertations and Theses;2017;;https://search.proquest.com/docview/1994544609?accountid=11774; 0310 Business administration , 0454 Management; 0310 Business administration , 0454 Management;; 0310 Business administration , 0454 Management;;; 0310 Business administration , 0454 Management; Business administration , Management; Social sciences , Age , Experience , Kosovo , Project management , Project manager , Project success;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ABI%2FINFORM+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Relationship+between+Project+Managers%27+Age%2C+Years+of+Project+Experience%2C+and+Project+Success&amp;issn=&amp;date=2017-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Hoxha%2C+Luli&amp;isbn=978-0-355-56841-7&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/";ProQuest Central
Ubiquitous learning model based on platforms of multi-screen TV (uLMTV);Although ICTs have strengthened educational processes, there are still some challenges on flexibility and convergence, among others. In this article, we propose a ubiquitous learning model (u-learning) that can have a positive impact on the teaching/ learning process since it considers video as an important element which can be displayed on any screen at any time and place. Besides indicating the elements making part of the model, alternatives of implementation, uses of video and experimentation with a cloud supported video platform are shown here. The results demonstrate an optimal deployment of the video at different devices when using a multi-screen video platform connected to the Internet, and show this model as a good reference to projects an u-learning service.;1994424200;Scholarly Journals;;"Moreno López, Gustavo Alberto;Jovani Alberto Jiménez Builes;Edgar Jesús Ramírez Monsalve";;; Copyright Universidad Nacional de Colombia 2017; 10.15446/dyna.v84n203.64160; Journal Article;; 2017;;0012-7353;203; English; English; 160-169; Bogota;2017;Dyna;2017;84;https://search.proquest.com/docview/1994424200?accountid=11774;;;;;; 160;; Learning , Learning , Experimentation; u-learning , ubiquitous computing , cloud computing , multi-screen TV , TV/video platforms everywhere , aprendizaje ubicuo , computación ubicua , computación en la nube , TV multipantalla , plataformas TV/video en todas partes;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Amaterialsscijournals&amp;atitle=Ubiquitous+learning+model+based+on+platforms+of+multi-screen+TV+%28uLMTV%29&amp;title=Dyna&amp;issn=00127353&amp;date=2017-01-01&amp;volume=84&amp;issue=203&amp;spage=160&amp;au=Moreno+L%C3%B3pez%2C+Gustavo+Alberto%3BJovani+Alberto+Jim%C3%A9nez+Builes%3BEdgar+Jes%C3%BAs+Ram%C3%ADrez+Monsalve&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=Dyna&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/10.15446%2Fdyna.v84n203.64160";ProQuest Central,SciTech Premium Collection
Motivating Introductory Computing Students with Pedagogical Datasets;Computing courses struggle to retain introductory students, especially as learner demographics have expanded to include more diverse majors, backgrounds, and career interests. Motivational contexts for these courses must extend beyond short-term interest to empower students and connect to learners’ long-term goals, while maintaining a scaffolded experience. To solve ongoing problems such as student retention, methods should be explored that can engage and motivate students. I propose Data Science as an introductory context that can appeal to a wide range of learners. To test this hypothesis, my work uses two educational theories—the MUSIC Model of Academic Motivation and Situated Learning Theory—to evaluate different components of a student’s learning experience for their contribution to the student’s motivation. I analyze existing contexts that are used in introductory computing courses, such as game design and media computation, and their limitations in regard to educational theories. I also review how Data Science has been used as a context, and its associated affordances and barriers. Next, I describe two research projects that make it simple to integrate Data Science into introductory classes. The first project, RealTimeWeb, was a prototypical exploration of how real-time web APIs could be scaffolded into introductory projects and problems. Real- TimeWeb evolved into the CORGIS Project, an extensible framework populated by a diverse collection of freely available “Pedagogical Datasets” designed specifically for novices. These datasets are available in easy-to-use libraries for multiple languages, various file formats, and also through accessible web-based tools. While developing these datasets, I identified and systematized a number of design issues, opportunities, and concepts involved in the preparation of Pedagogical Datasets. With the completed technology, I staged a number of interventions to evaluate Data Science as an introductory context and to better understand the relationship between student motivation and course outcomes.

Negotiating The Future: Leveraging Socio-technical Narratives to Engage Multiple Voices in the Ethics of our Future;As technology mediates more of our lives and leverages more of our personal data, ethical, legal, and policy questions gain more relevance and place pressure on our institutions and societal norms. This thesis looks at how the use of robust socio-technical narratives can act as a space for considering the correspondence between technical choices and social consequences of technology. Given the diversity of stakeholders who shape and are impacted by technology – such as user communities, lawyers, engineers, students, policymakers – it is critical we develop communication strategies and mediums for negotiating the sticky ethical and social questions relevant to technology development. This thesis explores several research areas where narrative acts as a tool for discussion, clarification, and negotiation about future uses of emerging technologies. The research work of this dissertation leverages narrative theoretically to support a policy framework for future regulation of data-driven technology. It further looks at how narrative can facilitate ethics discussion in the CS classroom, clarify and raise ethical issues for debate by engineers, and create a space for experts and non-experts to hold discourse and express values around technology ethics and policy. This work draws from several literatures including HCI topics such design fiction and user enactments, risk perception, policy, philosophy, law, and art.;1984627857;Dissertations & Theses;;Skirpan, Michael Warren;;;" Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.";; Dissertation/Thesis;; 2017; 978-0-355-54368-1;;; English; English;;;2017;ProQuest Dissertations and Theses;2017;;https://search.proquest.com/docview/1984627857?accountid=11774; 0389 Design , 0394 Ethics , 0984 Computer science; 0389 Design , 0394 Ethics , 0984 Computer science;; 0389 Design , 0394 Ethics , 0984 Computer science;;; 0389 Design , 0394 Ethics , 0984 Computer science; Design , Ethics , Computer science; Philosophy, religion and theology , Applied sciences , Communication and the arts , Ai , Big data , Ethics , Future , Machine learning , Narrative;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:Matericals+Science+%26+Engineering+Dissertations&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Negotiating+The+Future%3A+Leveraging+Socio-technical+Narratives+to+Engage+Multiple+Voices+in+the+Ethics+of+our+Future&amp;issn=&amp;date=2017-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Skirpan%2C+Michael+Warren&amp;isbn=978-0-355-54368-1&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/";SciTech Premium Collection
A Qualitative Study of Online Alumni Post-Graduation Involvement at a Community College: Perceptions of Pivotal Experiences Pre- and Post-Graduation;The college experience often includes activities outside the classroom that involve engaging with other students in a shared interest. These experiences often transform into alumni engaging in alumni functions, or participating through other means of identifying with the college, including wearing college logos. Online alumni involvement, specifically concerning donations, decreased with the number of completed courses online, perhaps indicating less engagement or minimal satisfaction. The specific problem was to identify origins for relationships between educational institutions and online alumni, specifically those alumni completing entire degree programs online. Alumni may develop feelings of loyalty or obligation to the educational institution based upon educational experiences, including active involvement with student organizations, but these options may be limited in the online campus depending upon the offerings available. Knowledge from this study added to the knowledge base for online alumni relationship development, factoring in the same concerns often identified with the online learner, including communication, time, technology, branding, loyalty, and interactions. The purpose of this qualitative study was to investigate existing relationships between online alumni and the educational institution in order to identify origins for relationship development. Online alumni received a request for participation via e-mail. This qualitative study, through using the lens of involvement theory and socialization theory, incorporated interviews with eight online alumni with documented involvement in the recognized alumni association to explore the emotional or psychological motivations for continuing relationships with the alma mater. The eight interviewees, online graduates from a small community college, self-selected participation in the study.;1973201300;Dissertations & Theses;;Painter, Lynette Darleen Borjeson;;;" Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.";; Dissertation/Thesis;; 2017; 978-0-355-50131-5;;; English; English;;;2017;ProQuest Dissertations and Theses;2017;;https://search.proquest.com/docview/1973201300?accountid=11774; 0275 Community college education , 0745 Higher education; 0275 Community college education , 0745 Higher education;; 0275 Community college education , 0745 Higher education;;; 0275 Community college education , 0745 Higher education; Community college education , Higher education; Education , Online alumni;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:Education+Database&amp;atitle=&amp;title=A+Qualitative+Study+of+Online+Alumni+Post-Graduation+Involvement+at+a+Community+College%3A+Perceptions+of+Pivotal+Experiences+Pre-+and+Post-Graduation&amp;issn=&amp;date=2017-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Painter%2C+Lynette+Darleen+Borjeson&amp;isbn=978-0-355-50131-5&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/";ProQuest Central,Social Science Premium Collection
Coding While Black;The focus on the lack of diversity in technology has become a hot topic over the last several years, with technology companies coming under fire for not being more representative of the markets that they serve. Even The White House and President Obama has made this issue of technology diversity and recruiting more women and people of color a topic of discussion hosting several events at The White House aimed at finding solutions to this issue. The issue has become so prevalent in the news recently that technology companies have been asked to publish report cards disclosing the demographic breakdown of their employee workforce. Most of the major technology companies in Silicon Valley have vowed to dedicate themselves to becoming more diverse, and have instituted programs to do such. However, progress has been slow and the results have been disappointing. Although many attempts to fix this problem has occurred for decades there has been no panacea to emerge. Why are there so few minorities pursuing careers in technology? The answer to this question at the moment is unknown. Although many experts have offered theories, there is little in the way of agreement. As the numbers continue to dwindle and more women and people of color continue to pursue careers in other fields or depart from the technology industry, technology companies are challenged to increase the number of underrepresented minorities in their workforce and to come up with solutions that address this issue that has become so important to the future economic growth of the United States. Qualitative by design, this study examines the perspectives, insights, and understandings of African American software development engineers. Accordingly, participants in this research study provided key insights regarding strategies, best practices, and challenges experienced by African American software development engineers while developing and implementing application programs at American corporations. Participants’ perspectives provided an insightful understanding of the complexities of being an underrepresented minority in an American corporate information technology department.;1971888340;Dissertations & Theses;;Dupe, Kai Ajala;;;" Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.";; Dissertation/Thesis;; 2017; 978-0-355-45203-7;;; English; English;;;2017;ProQuest Dissertations and Theses;2017;;https://search.proquest.com/docview/1971888340?accountid=11774; 0296 African American Studies , 0325 Black studies , 0710 Educational technology , 0984 Computer science; 0296 African American Studies , 0325 Black studies , 0710 Educational technology , 0984 Computer science;; 0296 African American Studies , 0325 Black studies , 0710 Educational technology , 0984 Computer science;;; 0296 African American Studies , 0325 Black studies , 0710 Educational technology , 0984 Computer science; African American Studies , Black studies , Educational technology , Computer science; Applied sciences , Social sciences , Education , Blacks in STEM , Blacks in technology , Digital divide , Digital equity , STEM , Tech diversity;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:Publicly+Available+Content+Database&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Coding+While+Black&amp;issn=&amp;date=2017-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Dupe%2C+Kai+Ajala&amp;isbn=978-0-355-45203-7&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/";ProQuest Central
STEM Vocational Socialization and Career Development in Middle Schools;Economic forecasts predict an unprecedented shortage of STEM workers in the United States. This study examined the vocational anticipatory socialization factors and classroom stratagems influencing middle school students’ science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) career development. Student attitudes towards STEM content areas and related career aspirations were measured. Parental, peer, media, out-of-school time activities and physical school environmental influences were examined along with teacher and school counselor capacities. The results showed middle schools were not actively engaging in STEM identity formation and career development practices nor were they providing out-of-school time STEM activities for their students. Parents, peers and the use of the online learning platform, Learning Blade did, however, have significant influences on students’ STEM career development.;1952713201;Dissertations & Theses;;Kendall, Katherine A.;;;" Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.";; Dissertation/Thesis;; 2017; 978-0-355-18873-8;;; English; English;;;2017;ProQuest Dissertations and Theses;2017;;https://search.proquest.com/docview/1952713201?accountid=11774; 0450 Middle School education , 0525 Educational psychology , 0624 Occupational psychology , 0714 Science education; 0450 Middle School education , 0525 Educational psychology , 0624 Occupational psychology , 0714 Science education;; 0450 Middle School education , 0525 Educational psychology , 0624 Occupational psychology , 0714 Science education;;; 0450 Middle School education , 0525 Educational psychology , 0624 Occupational psychology , 0714 Science education; Middle School education , Educational psychology , Occupational psychology , Science education; Psychology , Education , Career development , Careers , Identity , Middle school , STEM , Vocational socialization;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:Publicly+Available+Content+Database&amp;atitle=&amp;title=STEM+Vocational+Socialization+and+Career+Development+in+Middle+Schools&amp;issn=&amp;date=2017-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Kendall%2C+Katherine+A.&amp;isbn=978-0-355-18873-8&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/";ProQuest Central
Effects of Educational Support Services on Female Community College Students' Academic Success in STEM, STEM-Related, and Non-STEM Programs;"According to the American Association of University Women (AAUW) (n.d.), approximately 4 million women, more than ever before, rely on community colleges to prepare them for higher education and the workforce. These community college female students “represent all ages, races, and ethnicities, [and] include more than a million mothers”. Many female students have two main goals: (a) to attain a credential they were unable to at one point and/or (b) to gain or advance a skill set, thus making them competitive in the workforce (AAUW, n.d.). Single mothers, especially, are motivated “to pursue their education so they can better support their children and families; for women who want a bachelor’s degree, community colleges provide an affordable path to achieving that goal” (AAUW, n.d.). The primary purpose of this mixed method qualitative and quantitative study was to understand the support services that female community college students both require and utilize at Rowan-Cabarrus Community College (RCCC) in order to persist and be successful in their current program of study. The secondary purpose was to understand female community college students’ satisfaction with the student support services already provided by Rowan-Cabarrus. Within the present study, the researcher split female students into three categories by their current program: STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics), STEM-Related, or Non-STEM. Because there were so few female students in STEM programs at RCCC, the study also addressed how and why it is important to increase numbers of women in those programs or career fields. The researcher utilized data from the Community College Survey of Student Engagement (CCSSE) course completion and success data, persistence data from fall to spring semesters, and personal interviews. The women in the present study were at least 18 years of age, enrolled in a spring 2017 ENG-111 (Writing and Inquiry) course, and in a degree program at Rowan-Cabarrus Community College.";1946188511;Dissertations & Theses;;Billings, Jenny Elizabeth;;;" Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.";; Dissertation/Thesis;; 2017; 978-0-355-13765-1;;; English; English;;;2017;ProQuest Dissertations and Theses;2017;;https://search.proquest.com/docview/1946188511?accountid=11774; 0275 Community college education , 0453 Womens studies , 0515 Education; 0275 Community college education , 0453 Womens studies , 0515 Education;; 0275 Community college education , 0453 Womens studies , 0515 Education;;; 0275 Community college education , 0453 Womens studies , 0515 Education; Community college education , Womens studies , Education; Social sciences , Education , Academic support services , Female community college students , STEM , Student support services , Successful completion , the CCSSE;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:Education+Database&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Effects+of+Educational+Support+Services+on+Female+Community+College+Students%27+Academic+Success+in+STEM%2C+STEM-Related%2C+and+Non-STEM+Programs&amp;issn=&amp;date=2017-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Billings%2C+Jenny+Elizabeth&amp;isbn=978-0-355-13765-1&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/";ProQuest Central,Social Science Premium Collection
Student Perceptions of Quality in Fully Online Courses: A Mixed Methods Study;Online learning has become a significant component of the long-term strategy for leading universities into the future. The rapid growth of online learning forces the need for academic accountability. The purpose of this sequential mixed methods study was to examine factors affecting student perceptions of online course quality using benchmarks in the design principles of Teaching/Learning, Course Structure, and Student Support in online courses. Furthermore, the study aimed to discover whether the interaction of a social presence was perceived as important to the quality of the student’s online learning experience. The elements of benchmark categories, social presence, and student perceptions provide a great perspective of the educational experiences in fully online courses. Two hundred forty-five students were surveyed and eleven students participated in follow-up interviews. Results indicated that interaction between students and the instructor was a key element in their perceptions of a quality learning experience. Teaching presence was identified as very important to the quality of online courses. Benchmark standards measured in this study are important components to the design of online courses. These measurements act as an indicator to administrators, faculty, and instructional designers about the importance of designing courses that include the benchmark standards, especially instructor interactions as well as student-to-student interactions and social presence.;1944388467;Dissertations & Theses;;Thomas, Rita M.;;;" Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.";; Dissertation/Thesis;; 2017; 978-0-355-11586-4;;; English; English;;;2017;ProQuest Dissertations and Theses;2017;;https://search.proquest.com/docview/1944388467?accountid=11774; 0447 Instructional Design , 0449 Educational leadership , 0710 Educational technology; 0447 Instructional Design , 0449 Educational leadership , 0710 Educational technology;; 0447 Instructional Design , 0449 Educational leadership , 0710 Educational technology;;; 0447 Instructional Design , 0449 Educational leadership , 0710 Educational technology; Instructional Design , Educational leadership , Educational technology; Education , Interaction , Online learning , Quality , Social presence , Student perceptions;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:Education+Database&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Student+Perceptions+of+Quality+in+Fully+Online+Courses%3A+A+Mixed+Methods+Study&amp;issn=&amp;date=2017-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Thomas%2C+Rita+M.&amp;isbn=978-0-355-11586-4&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/";ProQuest Central,Social Science Premium Collection
Creole Languages in Education and Their Role in Shaping Caribbean Identities: Models for Integrating English Lexifier Creoles into School Curricula in the Eastern Caribbean;In this dissertation, I will identify and analyze the serious problems that have arisen in the Caribbean due to the imposition of European colonial languages as languages of instruction in the education systems of those territories of the region where the majority of the population speak a creole language. I will also identify and analyze the attempts that the people of the Western Caribbean have made thus far to address these problems in order to envision how the peoples of the Eastern Caribbean might also find a way to begin to transform a formal educational system whose language policies have reduced their children to failures and victims into a system that equips their children to be powerful agents in the learning process. When discussing solutions to the problems of the formal educational system in the Caribbean, I will be taking a novel approach, which I consider to be perhaps the most important and original contribution of this dissertation. I do not attempt to articulate possible solutions on the basis of models developed in the formal systems of the metropoles, because I refuse to turn my work into yet another colonial imposition of an inappropriate and imported ‘fix’ on the peoples of the region. Instead, I attempt to identify elements of the informal educational systems which have emerged organically over the past five centuries from the feminized, Africanized, Indigenized creole cultures of the Caribbean as both a foundation stone as well as a source of inspiration for the design and implementation of education policy and practice that serves our interests and reflects who we are as Caribbean peoples.;1944207066;Dissertations & Theses;;Zambrana, Pier Angeli LeCompte;;;" Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.";; Dissertation/Thesis;; 2017; 978-0-355-11846-9;;; English; English;;;2017;ProQuest Dissertations and Theses;2017;;https://search.proquest.com/docview/1944207066?accountid=11774; 0290 Linguistics , 0432 Caribbean Studies , 0455 Multicultural Education; 0290 Linguistics , 0432 Caribbean Studies , 0455 Multicultural Education;; 0290 Linguistics , 0432 Caribbean Studies , 0455 Multicultural Education;;; 0290 Linguistics , 0432 Caribbean Studies , 0455 Multicultural Education; Linguistics , Creoles , English , Children , Cultural identity , Language policy , Education policy , Colonial languages , Language teaching methods , Caribbean cultural groups , Multicultural education , Caribbean studies; Language, literature and linguistics , Social sciences , Education , Caribbean studies , Creole languages , Linguistics , Multicultural education , Plurilingualism , Sociolinguistics;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:Linguistics+and+Language+Behavior+Abstracts+%28LLBA%29&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Creole+Languages+in+Education+and+Their+Role+in+Shaping+Caribbean+Identities%3A+Models+for+Integrating+English+Lexifier+Creoles+into+School+Curricula+in+the+Eastern+Caribbean&amp;issn=&amp;date=2017-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Zambrana%2C+Pier+Angeli+LeCompte&amp;isbn=978-0-355-11846-9&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/";ProQuest Central,Social Science Premium Collection
Motivating Introductory Computing Students with Pedagogical Datasets;Computing courses struggle to retain introductory students, especially as learner demographics have expanded to include more diverse majors, backgrounds, and career interests. Motivational contexts for these courses must extend beyond short-term interest to empower students and connect to learners’ long-term goals, while maintaining a scaffolded experience. To solve ongoing problems such as student retention, methods should be explored that can engage and motivate students. I propose Data Science as an introductory context that can appeal to a wide range of learners. To test this hypothesis, my work uses two educational theories — the MUSIC Model of Academic Motivation and Situated Learning Theory — to evaluate different components of a student’s learning experience for their contribution to the student’s motivation. I analyze existing contexts that are used in introductory computing courses, such as game design and media computation, and their limitations in regard to educational theories. I also review how Data Science has been used as a context, and its associated affordances and barriers. Next, I describe two research projects that make it simple to integrate Data Science into introductory classes. The first project, RealTimeWeb, was a prototypical exploration of how real-time web APIs could be scaffolded into introductory projects and problems. Real- TimeWeb evolved into the CORGIS Project, an extensible framework populated by a diverse collection of freely available “Pedagogical Datasets” designed specifically for novices. These datasets are available in easy-to-use libraries for multiple languages, various file formats, and also through accessible web-based tools. While developing these datasets, I identified and systematized a number of design issues, opportunities, and concepts involved in the preparation of Pedagogical Datasets. With the completed technology, I staged a number of interventions to evaluate Data Science as an introductory context and to better understand the relationship between student motivation and course outcomes. I present findings that show evidence for the potential of a Data Science context to motivate learners. While I found evidence that the course content naturally has a stronger influence on course outcomes, the course context is a valuable component of the course’s learning experience.

College Choice and Student Selection of an Information-Technology Degree Program;This mixed-methods study analyzed data from 906 Ruffalo Noel Levitz Student Satisfaction Surveys (RNLSSS) at a two-year technical college in Wisconsin, to determine influences on participants’ choices of programs in information technology (IT). Quantitative results showed that none of eight variables (i.e., cost, financial assistance, academic reputation, future career opportunities, personal recommendations, distance from campus, information on the college website, campus visits) showed statistical significance. In addition, a focus group of IT students explored their student college choices, IT program choices, and IT career choices. Focus group data showed five themes (i.e., marketing, jobs, self-gratification, college staff and faculty, facilities, and location). Although quantitative findings were that five hypotheses were rejected, and qualitative findings were limited, six conclusions were drawn and ten recommendations were made for review by NTC administrators to improve curricula, faculty support, marketing, and outreach.;1937532407;Dissertations & Theses;;Severson, Christopher S.;;;" Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.";; Dissertation/Thesis;; 2017; 978-0-355-10209-3;;; English; English;;;2017;ProQuest Dissertations and Theses;2017;;https://search.proquest.com/docview/1937532407?accountid=11774; 0275 Community college education , 0489 Information Technology , 0514 Educational administration; 0275 Community college education , 0489 Information Technology , 0514 Educational administration;; 0275 Community college education , 0489 Information Technology , 0514 Educational administration;;; 0275 Community college education , 0489 Information Technology , 0514 Educational administration; Community college education , Information Technology , Educational administration; Applied sciences , Education , Career choice , College choice , Program choice;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:Education+Database&amp;atitle=&amp;title=College+Choice+and+Student+Selection+of+an+Information-Technology+Degree+Program&amp;issn=&amp;date=2017-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Severson%2C+Christopher+S.&amp;isbn=978-0-355-10209-3&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/";ProQuest Central,Social Science Premium Collection
Courting the Uncommitted: A Mixed-Methods Study of Undecided Students in Introductory Computer Science Courses;In the United States, there has been an increased focus on attracting and retaining more and diverse college students to computing majors to ensure that there is a trained workforce to fulfill jobs in the growing tech sector as well as to increase the representation of women and people of color in the computing industry. Some have suggested that computer science departments might recruit more diverse students to computing majors from the pool of undecided students on their campuses, particularly those who may be enrolled in introductory CS courses. The purpose of this study was to examine the experiences of undecided students enrolled in an introductory CS course that might encourage or dissuade them from pursuing a computing major. Drawing from career theory, science identity theory, and the extant literature, this study took a mixed-methods approach to develop a holistic picture of the experiences of undecided students who enroll in introductory CS courses. Specifically, this study used a national sample of students surveyed as part of the BRAID Research Project to conduct descriptive analyses and a blocked logistic regression. These analyses explored the characteristics of undecided students enrolled in introductory CS, their perceptions of the climate in the course, and the factors that predicted their decision to choose a computing major at the end of the course. Across all analyses, differences were examined by race and gender. Additionally, the study relied on interview data from undecided students who enrolled in introductory computing courses. Taking a phenomenological approach, the qualitative aspect of this study considers why undecided students enroll in introductory CS and how their experiences in the course inform their major choice decision. The findings from this study suggest that many undecided students who enroll in an introductory CS course will choose a computing major by the end of that course. Some aspects of their course experiences, particularly the extent to which undecided students feel supported by computing peers, play a role in their decision to pursue a computing major. Further, the findings from this study suggest that undecided students are more likely to be women than CS majors who enroll in introductory CS courses, making undecided students a good pool from which to recruit women to computing. However, once enrolled in the course, undecided students’ gender and racial/ethnic backgrounds play a minimal role in their decision to pursue computing. In light of these findings, the study provides implications for theory, CS departments, and CS introductory course instructors, as well as suggestions for future research.;1925941604;Dissertations & Theses;;Lehman, Kathleen Joelle;;;" Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.";; Dissertation/Thesis;; 2017; 978-0-355-05336-4;;; English; English;;;2017;ProQuest Dissertations and Theses;2017;;https://search.proquest.com/docview/1925941604?accountid=11774; 0745 Higher education , 0984 Computer science; 0745 Higher education , 0984 Computer science;; 0745 Higher education , 0984 Computer science;;; 0745 Higher education , 0984 Computer science; Higher education , Computer science; Applied sciences , Education , Computing , Gender , Higher education , Undecided students;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:Education+Database&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Courting+the+Uncommitted%3A+A+Mixed-Methods+Study+of+Undecided+Students+in+Introductory+Computer+Science+Courses&amp;issn=&amp;date=2017-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Lehman%2C+Kathleen+Joelle&amp;isbn=978-0-355-05336-4&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/";ProQuest Central,Social Science Premium Collection
Identification of Superintendent Leadership Strategies to Sustain Effective Professional Learning Communities;This qualitative research study identified leadership strategies implemented by nine superintendents’ to sustain professional learning communities in their districts. Four research questions guided the study regarding professional development, collaboration, benefits and barriers of superintendent leadership. A purposeful snowball sampling was utilized for the selection. The findings suggested professional learning communities (PLCs) are sustained when superintendents utilize the following leadership strategies for professional development and collaboration: professional development aligned to the district’s goals, engage in strategic planning, commit to professional growth and establish expectations, engage in open, clear communication, purposefully cultivate a collaborative culture, hire excellent principal leadership and are actively involved. A major benefit of superintendent’s leadership was providing support for focusing on student learning and the barriers superintendents encountered were the following: maintaining positive attitudes among staff members, providing resources, and keeping the direction focused on the vision. Superintendents need to transform their role as that of an active leader and demonstrate commitment to professional growth for educators to take ownership of their continued learning.;1925025454;Dissertations & Theses;;French, Kathryn J.;;;" Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.";; Dissertation/Thesis;; 2017; 978-0-355-04034-0;;; English; English;;;2017;ProQuest Dissertations and Theses;2017;;https://search.proquest.com/docview/1925025454?accountid=11774; 0449 Educational leadership , 0530 Teacher education; 0449 Educational leadership , 0530 Teacher education;; 0449 Educational leadership , 0530 Teacher education;;; 0449 Educational leadership , 0530 Teacher education; Educational leadership , Teacher education; Education , Collaboration , Met standard , Professional development , Professional learning communities , Shared practice , Superintendent;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:Education+Database&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Identification+of+Superintendent+Leadership+Strategies+to+Sustain+Effective+Professional+Learning+Communities&amp;issn=&amp;date=2017-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=French%2C+Kathryn+J.&amp;isbn=978-0-355-04034-0&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/";ProQuest Central,Social Science Premium Collection
Digital Writing in the Academy: Gains, Losses, and Rigorous Playfulness;The ethnographic study presented here documents emergent behaviors that arose when two multimodal composing and production tools - Collabosphere and Tumblr — were used in three different college courses (Introductory Psychology, Education 1B, and College Writing 101). The work addresses how conceptions of writing in the college classroom and across disciplines shift, converge, and vary across courses and between disciplines. I use Engeström’s (1999) model of activity theory to show how the introduction of new tools pushed both students and teachers to think more broadly and creatively about how they compose and comport themselves in academic settings. Specifically, this work reveals instances of expansive transformation as two activity systems – academic writing and digital writing – converged in these classrooms. By documenting new approaches that students and teachers developed when using new tools in an academic setting, I hope to visualize new opportunities for university writing to expand and include new literacy practices. This study documents how digital tools in the Academy were perceived, repurposed and used in a variety of different ways. I used a combination of interviews with faculty and students, observations, and analysis of semiotic materials to gain a holistic understanding of the dynamic activity systems at play in each setting, and across the university. Specifically, I endeavored to document the types of expectations placed on undergraduate students and faculty to use digital tools in innovative and compelling ways, and how those expectations informed how both approached composing in their courses. Here I strove to understand the new demands on college writers within different disciplinary departments, new kinds of audiences, and new kinds of texts as students collaboratively composed. This study also conceives to help educators and teaching faculty think about what kinds of methods, rubrics and assessment frameworks would help support students using new tools for writing in college classrooms. One of the central findings of this study is that in order to make room for expansive learning and new systems of writing to emerge, teachers must make explicit the course goals and assessment models for grading and evaluating digital and multimodal pieces. Without this framework, students often default to those writing models that were successful for them in the past, which were text-heavy and often discipline-specific. Further, teachers also need to help extend student’s notions of communication to include the visual and aural in a way that is both meaningful and critical. This study showed that it was not enough for students to simply present and prioritize multimodal composing, but that students needed a conceptual frame to understand how and why composing in different modes supported their analytic reasoning, and feel confident in their ability to synthesize them into their composing work.;1925001462;Dissertations & Theses;;DiZio, Jennifer Katherine;;;" Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.";; Dissertation/Thesis;; 2017; 978-0-355-03322-9;;; English; English;;;2017;ProQuest Dissertations and Theses;2017;;https://search.proquest.com/docview/1925001462?accountid=11774; 0340 Educational sociology , 0710 Educational technology; 0340 Educational sociology , 0710 Educational technology;; 0340 Educational sociology , 0710 Educational technology;;; 0340 Educational sociology , 0710 Educational technology; Educational sociology , Educational technology; Education , Collabosphere , Literacy , Social media , Tumblr;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:Publicly+Available+Content+Database&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Digital+Writing+in+the+Academy%3A+Gains%2C+Losses%2C+and+Rigorous+Playfulness&amp;issn=&amp;date=2017-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=DiZio%2C+Jennifer+Katherine&amp;isbn=978-0-355-03322-9&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/";ProQuest Central
At The Intersection of Space, Place, and Experience: An Ethnographic Case Study of Affordances in Architectural Design 1;"This ethnographic case study explored the learning environment of a studio design course to describe how interactions in the studio environment shape students’ understandings and behaviors as they learn the fundamental elements of design and architectural practice. The purpose of the study was to understand the role of the studio environment in supporting students’ architectural knowledge and identity and provide insight into how individual-environment interactions shape how students make meaning of their learning experiences. I spent a semester as a participant-observer in a beginning architecture course at a large, public university, and gathered data through approximately 106 hours of studio observations, 39 in-depth interviews, course-related artifacts, and reflections on studio visits. Using a conceptual framework of affordances (Gibson, 1979; Greeno 1994), I describe the various ways the studio environment creates opportunities for social interaction and how studio culture intersects with the affordances of the studio environment. The study revealed the physical affordances of the studio environment were the open layout, public/private workspaces, and co-working in proximity to others. The structural affordances were long blocks of unscheduled work time, alignment between studio and other courses in the curriculum, the project brief, and the sequencing of the projects, tasks, and deadlines. The pedagogical affordances were formal and informal critique, mini-lectures, and demonstrations. Four characteristics of studio culture as defined by the literature—(a) a community of learners and architects; (b) centralizing feedback; (c) untimetabled design activity; and (d) experimentation and risk-taking—intersected with the physical, structural, and physical affordances of the studio in how beginning architecture students made meaning of their learning. Based on the findings of this study, implications were offered for architecture and design educators, faculty interested in adopting studio learning environments in non-design fields, and future research on studio learning environments.";1918607458;Dissertations & Theses;;Rands, Melissa L.;;;" Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.";; Dissertation/Thesis;; 2017; 978-1-369-88009-0;;; English; English;;;2017;ProQuest Dissertations and Theses;2017;;https://search.proquest.com/docview/1918607458?accountid=11774; 0389 Design , 0727 Curriculum development , 0729 Architecture , 0745 Higher education; 0389 Design , 0727 Curriculum development , 0729 Architecture , 0745 Higher education;; 0389 Design , 0727 Curriculum development , 0729 Architecture , 0745 Higher education;;; 0389 Design , 0727 Curriculum development , 0729 Architecture , 0745 Higher education; Design , Curriculum development , Architecture , Higher education; Communication and the arts , Education , Affordances , Case study , Ethnographic methods , Learning environments , Studio;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:Education+Database&amp;atitle=&amp;title=At+The+Intersection+of+Space%2C+Place%2C+and+Experience%3A+An+Ethnographic+Case+Study+of+Affordances+in+Architectural+Design+1&amp;issn=&amp;date=2017-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Rands%2C+Melissa+L.&amp;isbn=978-1-369-88009-0&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/";ProQuest Central,Social Science Premium Collection
Tinkering in k-12: an exploratory mixed methods study of makerspaces in schools as an application of constructivist learning;Makerspaces have experienced a surge in popularity in recent years, resulting in an influx of Maker education in K-12 settings. While Makerspaces have been studied abundantly in museums, libraries, and in after-school programs, little research has been conducted inside the K- 12 school day. The goal of this study is to discover insights of established Makerspaces inside the K-12 school environment. In this exploratory mixed methods study, educators were survived, examining school and participant demographics, Makerspace setup, as well as intersections of technology, content, and pedagogy. Next, the researcher conducted a follow-up interview with selected participants based on diversity in the following key demographic areas: teacher gender, professional background, and school environment. In order to better understand K-12 implementation of Makerspaces, the study examines seven characteristics of Makerspaces: setting, computational thinking, participant structures, teacher training, gender and racial issues, assessment, and sustainability. The data was examined through TPACK framework with a constructivist approach. Makerspaces can empower students to invent, prototype, and tinker with low-cost technology tools such as microcircuits and fabrication tools such as 3d printers. The goal of this study is to add to the body of literature regarding the role and potential value of Makerspaces in school environments. This exploration of Makerspaces in K-12 setting could be generalized to serve as a guide for teachers who want to establish their own Makerspace.;1906299377;Dissertations & Theses;;Cross, Ashley;;;" Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.";; Dissertation/Thesis;; 2017; 978-1-369-77520-4;;; English; English;;;2017;ProQuest Dissertations and Theses;2017;;https://search.proquest.com/docview/1906299377?accountid=11774; 0524 Elementary education , 0710 Educational technology; 0524 Elementary education , 0710 Educational technology;; 0524 Elementary education , 0710 Educational technology;;; 0524 Elementary education , 0710 Educational technology; Elementary education , Educational technology; Education , Constructivist , K-12 , Makerspaces , School makerspace , Tinkering;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:Education+Database&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Tinkering+in+k-12%3A+an+exploratory+mixed+methods+study+of+makerspaces+in+schools+as+an+application+of+constructivist+learning&amp;issn=&amp;date=2017-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Cross%2C+Ashley&amp;isbn=978-1-369-77520-4&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/";ProQuest Central,Social Science Premium Collection
Teachers' Use of Instructional Moves During Technology-Based Mathematical Activities;"This study investigates instructional moves by teachers in mathematics classrooms in which technology-based activities (i.e., student-oriented simulations) and features of those simulations influence classroom practices. Four teachers were studied over the course of a year as an exploratory study to build interpretive cases that described instructional practices in technology-based lessons. Teachers developed lessons using PhET simulations designed to support algebraic reasoning. Data sources included teachers’ process of selecting and designing lessons, observations of teachers’ non-technology and technology-based mathematical activities, and teacher interviews and reflections. This work was based on a conceptual framework blending the ideas of Mathematical Tasks (Stein, Smith, Henningsen, &amp; Silver, 1998), Mathematical Pedagogical Content Knowledge (Ball, Thames, &amp; Phelps, 2008), and Technological Pedagogical Content Knowledge (Mishra &amp; Koehler, 2006), in which teachers’ instructional practices are determined by teachers’ mathematical pedagogical content knowledge, task selection and design, and use of technology. Results indicated that teachers see simulations as having significant benefits in the classroom. Teachers leveraged these opportunities by increasing class discussions, engaging in higher levels of thinking and reasoning, and focusing on mathematical representations. When teachers used simulations, the teachers spent less time in direct instruction, focused more on the mathematics, and focused more on investigations rather than drill-oriented tasks. Technology in the classroom, however, was problematic for some teachers. The very nature of students working independently with their own devices meant that student-student interactions decreased in some lessons. Furthermore, teachers’ discomfort in managing technology seems to limit ongoing use. Specific features of the simulations that prompted instructional moves included the ability to support conceptual understanding and build student engagement. Simulations also provided a ‘low floor, high ceiling,’ supporting differentiation, and a dynamic responsiveness, facilitating connections between representations. On the other hand, teachers raised concerns that some features of the simulation could do the math for the students. Furthermore, the perception of simulations as being a game may impact how and when simulations are used. The emergent use of technology in math classrooms is under-supported. For simulations to be used in a more extensive fashion in mathematics classes, professional development and curricular materials are needed to support implementation.";1904505276;Dissertations & Theses;;Miller, Susan B.;;;" Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.";; Dissertation/Thesis;; 2017; 978-1-369-78527-2;;; English; English;;;2017;ProQuest Dissertations and Theses;2017;;https://search.proquest.com/docview/1904505276?accountid=11774; 0280 Mathematics education; 0280 Mathematics education;; 0280 Mathematics education;;; 0280 Mathematics education; Mathematics education; Education , Curriculum and instruction , Instructional practices , Mathematics , Simulations , Teacher education , Technology;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:Publicly+Available+Content+Database&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Teachers%27+Use+of+Instructional+Moves+During+Technology-Based+Mathematical+Activities&amp;issn=&amp;date=2017-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Miller%2C+Susan+B.&amp;isbn=978-1-369-78527-2&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/";ProQuest Central
Eportfolio Adoption's Mediating Influence on Faculty Perspectives: An Activity Theory View;A case-comparative mixed methods approach was used to discover how faculty members’ teaching perspectives changed as they adopted an eportfolio tool (Pathbrite). Ten faculty members took the Teaching Perspectives Inventory (TPI) before and after using the tool during Fall semester 2015. Also, systems logs were collected and interviews were conducted after the post survey was completed. Interview data found that faculty members developed a broader view of the potential of eportfolios. Participants also appreciated the long-term benefits that eportfolios would have on their students. However, when use was associated with accreditation standards, gains in student-centered perspectives were minimal. The study suggests cognitive apprenticeship as a model that explains the discovered findings and provides recommendations to administrators who are implementing eportfolios.;1899599827;Dissertations & Theses;;Thomas, Jonathan M.;;;" Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.";; Dissertation/Thesis;; 2017; 978-1-369-75828-3;;; English; English;;;2017;ProQuest Dissertations and Theses;2017;;https://search.proquest.com/docview/1899599827?accountid=11774; 0449 Educational leadership , 0710 Educational technology; 0449 Educational leadership , 0710 Educational technology;; 0449 Educational leadership , 0710 Educational technology;;; 0449 Educational leadership , 0710 Educational technology; Educational leadership , Educational technology; Education , Eportfolio adoption , Faculty development , Higher education , Teaching beliefs;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:Education+Database&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Eportfolio+Adoption%27s+Mediating+Influence+on+Faculty+Perspectives%3A+An+Activity+Theory+View&amp;issn=&amp;date=2017-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Thomas%2C+Jonathan+M.&amp;isbn=978-1-369-75828-3&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/";ProQuest Central,Social Science Premium Collection
The Maker Movement, the Promise of Higher Education, and the Future of Work;The 21 st century will be the site of numerous changes in education systems in response to a rapidly evolving technological environment where existing skill sets and career structures may cease to exist or, at the very least, change dramatically. Likewise, the nature of work will also change to become more automated and more technologically intensive across all sectors, from food service to scientific research. Simply having technical expertise or the ability to process and retain facts will in no way guarantee success in higher education or a satisfying career. Instead, the future will value those educated in a way that encourages collaboration with technology, critical thinking, creativity, clear communication skills, and strong lifelong learning strategies. These changes pose a challenge for higher education’s promise of employability and success post-graduation. Addressing how to prepare students for a technologically uncertain future is challenging. One possible model for education to prepare students for the future of work can be found within the Maker Movement. However, it is not fully understood what parts of this movement are most meaningful to implement in education more broadly, and higher education in particular. Through the qualitative analysis of nearly 160 interviews of adult makers, young makers and young makers’ parents, this dissertation unpacks how makers are learning, what they are learning, and how these qualities are applicable to education goals and the future of work in the 21 st century. This research demonstrates that makers are learning valuable skills to prepare them for the future of work in the 21 st century. Makers are learning communication skills, technical skills in fabrication and design, and developing lifelong learning strategies that will help prepare them for life in an increasingly technologically integrated future. This work discusses what aspects of the Maker Movement are most important for integration into higher education.;1898694821;Dissertations & Theses;;Wigner, Aubrey;;;" Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.";; Dissertation/Thesis;; 2017; 978-1-369-74520-7;;; English; English;;;2017;ProQuest Dissertations and Theses;2017;;https://search.proquest.com/docview/1898694821?accountid=11774; 0456 Pedagogy , 0458 Education Policy , 0714 Science education , 0745 Higher education; 0456 Pedagogy , 0458 Education Policy , 0714 Science education , 0745 Higher education;; 0456 Pedagogy , 0458 Education Policy , 0714 Science education , 0745 Higher education;;; 0456 Pedagogy , 0458 Education Policy , 0714 Science education , 0745 Higher education; Pedagogy , Education Policy , Science education , Higher education; Education , Automation , Engineering education , Future of work , Maker movement , Makerspace , Making;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:Education+Database&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+Maker+Movement%2C+the+Promise+of+Higher+Education%2C+and+the+Future+of+Work&amp;issn=&amp;date=2017-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Wigner%2C+Aubrey&amp;isbn=978-1-369-74520-7&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/";ProQuest Central,Social Science Premium Collection
An Adaptive Methodological Inquiry: Exploring a TESOL Teacher Education Program's Affordances and Constraints in Libya as a Conflict Zone;"This adaptive methodological inquiry explored the affordances and constraints of one TESOL teacher education program in Libya as a conflict zone. Data was collected through seven documents and 33 questionnaires. Questionnaires were gathered from the investigated program’s teacher-educators, student-teachers, and graduates, who were in-service teachers. Interviews were not conducted because all participants who agreed to be interviewed withdrew as a result of prolonged electrical blackouts in Libya during the data collection period. The findings revealed that even though the participants were positively satisfied with their program’s basic components, they showed dissatisfaction toward a number of issues. Participants’ perceived affordances of their program included offering teacher preparation and training courses, offering language development courses, and offering school-based teaching practices. The program’s constraints, as perceived by the participants, were the following: the program did not meet the Libyan ministry’s ELT objectives; the program only had one curriculum that prepared student-teachers for three educational levels; the program had unachieved curricular objectives; the program had curricular deficiencies; the program relied too heavily on one form of assessment; the program offered short teaching practice periods, the program had graduation project challenges; the program lacked quality assurance; and the program did not offer professional development opportunities. Findings also revealed that the participants regarded critical language teacher education as an effective approach for program reform due to the current political and social chaos that is mounting in Libya. The current status of the program shows that it does not prepare student-teachers to teach English in a conflict zone. Thus, participants recommended implementing peace, social justice, and environmental education into the curriculum to help raise student-teachers’ awareness and to work towards positive change in the Libyan educational and social culture.";1887124557;Dissertations & Theses;;Elsherif, Entisar;;;" Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.";; Dissertation/Thesis;; 2017; 978-1-369-69986-9;;; English; English;;;2017;ProQuest Dissertations and Theses;2017;;https://search.proquest.com/docview/1887124557?accountid=11774; 0441 English as a Second Language , 0530 Teacher education , 0727 Curriculum development; 0441 English as a Second Language , 0530 Teacher education , 0727 Curriculum development;; 0441 English as a Second Language , 0530 Teacher education , 0727 Curriculum development;;; 0441 English as a Second Language , 0530 Teacher education , 0727 Curriculum development; English as a Second Language , Teacher education , Curriculum development , Language acquisition , Data collection , English as a second language teaching methods , College students , Teacher education , Politics , Questionnaires , Educational attainment , TESOL , Second language teachers , English as a second language instruction , Libya; Education , Efl teacher education , Efl teacher preparation , Second language teacher education , Teacher preparation , Tesol in conflict zones , Tesol teacher education;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:Education+Database&amp;atitle=&amp;title=An+Adaptive+Methodological+Inquiry%3A+Exploring+a+TESOL+Teacher+Education+Program%27s+Affordances+and+Constraints+in+Libya+as+a+Conflict+Zone&amp;issn=&amp;date=2017-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Elsherif%2C+Entisar&amp;isbn=978-1-369-69986-9&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/";ProQuest Central,Social Science Premium Collection
Using Google applications as part of cloud computing to improve knowledge and teaching skills of faculty members at the University of Bisha, Bisha, Saudi Arabia;"Cloud computing is a recent computing paradigm that has been integrated into the educational system. It provides numerous opportunities for delivering a variety of computing services in a way that has not been experienced before. The Google Company is among the top business companies that afford their cloud services by launching a number of business and educational Apps. Google runs these Apps for free to be used for educational purposes, which saves a huge amount of expense for institutions and allows them to direct scarce financial resources to other areas of need. King Khalid University (KKU) was the first and only Saudi university since 2012 that officially offered Google Apps to its faculty members, staff, and students. The University of Bisha, a new independent university that was separated from KKU, became the second university that owns Google Apps as part of its academic services. This gives The UoB a distinctive opportunity and a unique reason for using Google products and learning from the experience. This research focuses on how The UoB faculty members take advantage of these Apps’ benefits in terms of improving their academic and professional knowledge in their discipline as well as improving their teaching expertise within the Constructivist philosophy, methodologies, and traditions. The literature review provides an overview of the essential sources which support this research. The research focused on The UoB academic instructors in order to study their behavior and potential problems and issues they experience in employing Google Apps to improve teaching, organization, academic collaboration, self-education, and other educational purposes. Precisely, it addresses the following questions: • In what way are the instructors’ views at The UoB about using Google Apps influencing subject matter and teaching improvement? • What issues—positive or negative—do The UoB faculty members have regarding the varieties of Cloud computing and, specifically, Google Academic Applications? • What are The UoB instructors’ experiences in using Google Academic Apps in higher education? The instrument in both English and Arabic was sent to 673 members. Only 131 contributors participated fully. The instrument consists 44 questions in five sections; both closed and open-ended questions were used. The instrument was piloted by eight experts and it has both face and content validity. The study showed that multiple and various levels of knowledge and specific skills may significantly affect the ability of the members of the faculty and academic staff to apply the benefits of using Google services/ tools in their professional activities. Lacks of experience, tool awareness and effectiveness in using Google services may result in lower confidence and trust in Google products, as well as disappointment, and the formation of biased negative opinion regarding usefulness of these applications for academic users within the university environment. There are limitations to this study. For example, a lengthy instrument; unclear meaning of some questions because of dual English and Arabic translations; distribution of survey during exam time; fear some faculty in smaller departments being disciplined for the answers they provide, among others. The results point out the need of disseminate the awareness of modern teaching methods and theories between faculty more often; training and faculty workshops in the use of Google Apps; team development activities in collaborative teaching; and designing an online course in Arabic Language and make it available for both members and students 24/7; integrating Google suite into academic meetings and other services in order to increase faculty’s collaboration and productivity.

Relationship between the self-efficacy and self-directed learning of adults in undergraduate programs;"In the current adult education environment, self-directed learning (SDL) is becoming a necessary learning characteristic and an academic process of learning to allow adult learners to complete programs and further enhance lifelong learning. The purpose of this quantitative study was to examine the relationship between self-efficacy and SDL in adult learners in undergraduate programs at a state college in southeastern United States. Information from undergraduate adult learners on their perceptions of what constitutes the behavioral components (i.e., initiative, control, self-efficacy, and motivation) that promote SDL (Stockdale &amp; Brockett, 2011) was collected. Results could generate curriculum changes in existing programs to allow adult learners to become self-directed learners. In addition, the role of sex, age, and educational accomplishment also were examined. To examine the relationship between learners’ self-efficacy and SDL, as measured by the Personal Responsibility Orientation of Self-Direction in Learning Scale (Stockdale &amp; Brockett, 2011), a relational, correlational design was conducted. Results showed a strong and statistically significant relationship between self-efficacy as a learner personality characteristic and SDL. There was a low to negligible association, along with no statistical significance, between the additional variables (age, sex, and educational accomplishment) and SDL addressed in this study. Suggestions for future research include further analysis of SDL and its role in andragogy.";1884244897;Dissertations & Theses;;Langshaw, Shelly J.;;;" Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.";; Dissertation/Thesis;; 2017; 978-1-369-66799-8;;; English; English;;;2017;ProQuest Dissertations and Theses;2017;;https://search.proquest.com/docview/1884244897?accountid=11774; 0516 Adult education , 0745 Higher education; 0516 Adult education , 0745 Higher education;; 0516 Adult education , 0745 Higher education;;; 0516 Adult education , 0745 Higher education; Adult education , Higher education; Education , Adult education , Andragogy , Post-secondary education , Self-directed learning (SDL) , Self-efficacy;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:Education+Database&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Relationship+between+the+self-efficacy+and+self-directed+learning+of+adults+in+undergraduate+programs&amp;issn=&amp;date=2017-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Langshaw%2C+Shelly+J.&amp;isbn=978-1-369-66799-8&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/";ProQuest Central,Social Science Premium Collection
Examination of badges to increase nursing student engagement: A quasi-experimental study;Finding ways to help nursing students understand the application of didactic content can be challenging for faculty. One challenge faculty face is motivating students with thought provoking and memorable content using traditional methods. Educational games and gaming attributes have been shown to affect student motivation and support learning. The aim of this study was to gain knowledge, filling a knowledge gap, regarding which gaming attributes motivate nursing students to become engaged in course content that is not graded. Badges were used as a reward system to examine if nursing students would complete an increased number of non-graded case studies, and have a higher score on the posttest than when badges were not used. Data was collected using an A-B single group design during two consecutive specialty courses. A one-tailed dependent t-test was used to compare the average scores of case study posttests and the average number of case studies completed during both phases. All participants were nursing students in a three-year accelerated baccalaureate degree program attending a college of nursing located in the southwest. There was no significant difference with the use of badges on the average scores of case studies t (24) = -1.332, p =0.1. However, there was a significant difference with the use of badges on the number of completed case studies t (24) = -2.5, p =0.01. This study adds empirical evidence to the literature that gamification attributions positively influences student motivation and continued engagement in course content. Findings demonstrated a significant difference in the engagement of nursing students in non-graded coursework during the course where badges were offered as rewards as opposed to the course where badges were not offered as rewards. As technology savvy Millennials fill the classrooms and nursing faculty search for new teaching strategies to engage their students, the results of this study promotes the use of badging as a way to actively engage nursing students in course content. Additional research with a larger sample is recommended to support the findings and examine the effect gamification attributions have on knowledge retention.;1882222254;Dissertations & Theses;;Moritz, Sharon Carol;;;" Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.";; Dissertation/Thesis;; 2017; 978-1-369-64375-6;;; English; English;;;2017;ProQuest Dissertations and Theses;2017;;https://search.proquest.com/docview/1882222254?accountid=11774; 0516 Adult education , 0569 Nursing; 0516 Adult education , 0569 Nursing;; 0516 Adult education , 0569 Nursing;;; 0516 Adult education , 0569 Nursing; Adult education , Nursing; Health and environmental sciences , Education , Badge , Engagement , Game , Gamification , Motivation;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:Nursing+%26+Allied+Health+Database&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Examination+of+badges+to+increase+nursing+student+engagement%3A+A+quasi-experimental+study&amp;issn=&amp;date=2017-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Moritz%2C+Sharon+Carol&amp;isbn=978-1-369-64375-6&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/";ProQuest Central
Unicorn data scientist: the rarest of breeds;Purpose Many organizations are seeking unicorn data scientists, that rarest of breeds that can do it all. They are said to be experts in many traditionally distinct disciplines, including mathematics, statistics, computer science, artificial intelligence, and more. The purpose of this paper is to describe authors' pursuit of these elusive mythical creatures. Design/methodology/approach Qualitative data were collected through semi-structured interviews with managers/directors from nine Australian state and federal government agencies with relatively mature data science functions. Findings Although the authors failed to find evidence of unicorn data scientists, they are pleased to report on six key roles that are considered to be required for an effective data science team. Primary and secondary skills for each of the roles are identified and the resulting framework is then used to illustratively evaluate three data science Master-level degrees offered by Australian universities. Research limitations/implications Given that the findings presented in this paper have been based on a study with large government agencies with relatively mature data science functions, they may not be directly transferable to less mature, smaller, and less well-resourced agencies and firms. Originality/value The skills framework provides a theoretical contribution that may be applied in practice to evaluate and improve the composition of data science teams and related training programs.;1879624006;Scholarly Journals;;"Baskarada, Sasa;Koronios, Andy";;" University of South Australia

Technology Innovation and Engineering’ Education and Entrepreneurship (TIEE) in Engineering Schools: Novel Model for Elevating National Knowledge Based Economy and Socio-Economic Sustainable Development;"The Technology Innovation and Engineering Education (TIEE) is a proposed Unit/Center/Department concept model inside a college of engineering. The TIEE concept has been developed in particular taking in consideration the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) and/or Qatar contextual needs and National Vision in the transformation into a Knowledge Based Economy (KBE). The main purpose of such structure is to enable engineering colleges to better respond to these emerging needs of the GCC countries. In this paper, the concept of TIEE is provisioned as an example of organizational structure development for other engineering education institutions that aim to play a key role in innovation and sustainable socio-economic development. The concept is derived from similar global examples and contextualized regionally; it is generic and can be deployed elsewhere with slight modifications. The TIEE concept is in particular vital for engineering institutions in the Middle East and North Africa as a vehicle for economic and technological development. The paper outlines the organizational structure of TIEE, together with its various programs and activities for implementing its stated vision, mission, and strategic objectives. Within this context, the paper also provides a thorough account on advances in engineering innovation, education, scholarship of engineering education, and developments of similar entities.";1878414541;Scholarly Journals;;Abdulwahed, Mahmoud;;; Copyright MDPI AG 2017; 10.3390/su9020171; Journal Article;; 2017;;;2; English; English;; Basel;2017;Sustainability;2017;9;https://search.proquest.com/docview/1878414541?accountid=11774;;;;;; 171;; Sustainable development , Engineering , Entrepreneurship , Economic models , Vision , Sustainable development , Organizational structure , Engineering education , Economic development , Knowledge base , Innovations , Organizational aspects;;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Assamodule&amp;atitle=Technology+Innovation+and+Engineering%26rsquo%3B+Education+and+Entrepreneurship+%28TIEE%29+in+Engineering+Schools%3A+Novel+Model+for+Elevating+National+Knowledge+Based+Economy+and+Socio-Economic+Sustainable+Development&amp;title=Sustainability&amp;issn=&amp;date=2017-01-01&amp;volume=9&amp;issue=2&amp;spage=171&amp;au=Abdulwahed%2C+Mahmoud&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=Sustainability&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/10.3390%2Fsu9020171";ProQuest Central,SciTech Premium Collection
Lebanon’s 2011 ICT education reform strategy and action plan: Curriculum success or abeyance;The purpose of the present study was to investigate the effectiveness of Lebanon’s Education Reform Strategy and Action Plan (LERSAP) set in 2011 as a form of the educational reform the curriculum underwent through focusing on promoting and employing the information communication technology (ICT) tools. The LERSAP was launched to equip teachers with the expertise and competencies adopted to bridge the disparity between the 1997 curriculum guidelines, general and instructional objectives on the one hand and the curriculum implementation, textbooks, and pedagogical practices on the other hand. The general objectives, introductions, instructional objectives, and activities for grades 3, 6, and 9 of the Lebanese English language curriculum were analyzed using the qualitative design implemented to serve the purposes of the study and to build on the approaches that inform about the theoretical/conceptual and empirical literature on education in Lebanon. The findings of the study indicated that the synthesis of the extant literature underscored the positive effect of the ICT tools in general and that of the WebQuest, Wiki, Google Drive, and Window Live Movie Maker models in particular on improving the pedagogical practices of the teachers and on enhancing the learners’ skills as well as increasing the motivation of the learners.;2127124079;Scholarly Journals; Department of Education, American University of Beirut, Fisk Hall, Room 249, P.O.

Relevance of the Sankofa Teaching and Learning Approach: A Cultural Comparison;  The purpose of this study was to identify the teaching and learning strategies perceived as relevant by students at a historically black university (HBU) versus those at a predominantly white institution (PWI). Volunteers completed an online survey related to culturally relevant pedagogy. Results indicated that cultural relevance of pedagogies varied by the type of institution. Interaction effects of gender and type of institution on the relevance of the items were also identified. Understanding these differences is a step towards being responsive to the increasingly diverse student body and to facilitate positive academic outcomes for this generation of students.;1851056516;Scholarly Journals;;"Talpade, Medha;Talpade, Salil";;; Copyright North American Journal of Psychology Dec 2016;; Feature;; Dec 2016;;1527-7143;3; English; English; 453-468; Winter Garden;Dec 2016;North American Journal of Psychology;2016;18;https://search.proquest.com/docview/1851056516?accountid=11774;;; Tables , References;;; 453;; Learning , Colleges & universities , Teachers , Teaching;;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aabiglobal&amp;atitle=Relevance+of+the+Sankofa+Teaching+and+Learning+Approach%3A+A+Cultural+Comparison&amp;title=North+American+Journal+of+Psychology&amp;issn=15277143&amp;date=2016-12-01&amp;volume=18&amp;issue=3&amp;spage=453&amp;au=Talpade%2C+Medha%3BTalpade%2C+Salil&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=North+American+Journal+of+Psychology&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/";ProQuest Central
Information management model for competencies and learning outcomes in an educational context;  The Bologna Process opened the door to the globalization of higher education, by creating a unified architecture that enhances the potential of higher education and encourages increasing and continuous interconnection among different higher education strategies in the world, and particularly in Europe. This paper introduces and describes an innovative model for a thorough, organized and systematic analysis of the educational context MICRA (model for identifying and classifying Competencies and Learning Outcomes), based on the official documents of the Course Units (syllabus and assessment components). The MICRA model was validated by means of a case study. Competencies and Learning Outcomes were identified in the Computer Science Course Units of the Accounting and Business Administration degree at the Institute of Accounting and Administration of Porto (ISCAP/IPP). We are aware that the adoption of this model by different institutions will contribute to the interoperability of learning outcomes, thus enhancing the mobility of teachers and students in the EHEA (European Higher Education Area) and third countries.;1843255674;Scholarly Journals;;"Gonçalves, Maria José; Angélico;Rocha, Álvaro;Cota, Manuel Pérez";;; Information Systems Frontiers is a copyright of Springer, 2016.; 10.1007/s10796-016-9623-4; Feature;; Dec 2016;;1387-3326;6; English; English; 1051-1061; New York;Dec 2016;Information Systems Frontiers;2016;18;https://search.proquest.com/docview/1843255674?accountid=11774;;;;;; 1051;; Globalization , Higher education , Learning , Semantic web , Information systems , Analysis , Studies; Bologna , Competencies , Learning outcomes , Syllabus , Topics , Interoperability , Semantic web;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aabiglobal&amp;atitle=Information+management+model+for+competencies+and+learning+outcomes+in+an+educational+context&amp;title=Information+Systems+Frontiers&amp;issn=13873326&amp;date=2016-12-01&amp;volume=18&amp;issue=6&amp;spage=1051&amp;au=Gon%C3%A7alves%2C+Maria+Jos%C3%A9%3B+Ang%C3%A9lico%3BRocha%2C+%C3%81lvaro%3BCota%2C+Manuel+P%C3%A9rez&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=Information+Systems+Frontiers&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/10.1007%2Fs10796-016-9623-4";ProQuest Central,SciTech Premium Collection,Social Science Premium Collection
Possibilities and limitations of integrating peer instruction into technical creativity education;  The effects of active peer-peer interaction on the generation of new hypotheses or models and the increase of new solutions have attracted widespread attention. Therefore, the peer discussion portion of peer instruction is supposedly effective in developing students' creativity. However, few empirical research involves how to adapt peer instruction to concrete subject areas to increase different-level students' creativity. This study aimed to assess the possibilities and limitations of peer instruction in teaching technical creativity to different-level students through empirical teachings in authentic high school classrooms. The results showed that peer discussion was effective in improving the creative performances of all (higher-, medium-, and lower-level) students when they have already had original ideas. However, in facilitating lower-level students to generate their own ideas from nothing, peer instruction was not as good as a teacher-centered teaching method--explicit technical creativity teaching. To develop different-level students' creativity, a hybrid-type of peer instruction, i.e., the combination of peer instruction and explicit technical creativity teaching, was suggested.;1832138648;Scholarly Journals;;"Wang, Shijuan;Murota, Masao"; INLSBJ;; Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht 2016; 10.1007/s11251-016-9385-x; Feature;; Dec 2016;;0020-4277;6; English; English; 501-525; Dordrecht;Dec 2016;Instructional Science;2016;44;https://search.proquest.com/docview/1832138648?accountid=11774;;; References;;; 501;; Peer tutoring , Education , Creativity; Peer instruction , Technical creativity , Creativity education , Explicit technical creativity education;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aeducation&amp;atitle=Possibilities+and+limitations+of+integrating+peer+instruction+into+technical+creativity+education&amp;title=Instructional+Science&amp;issn=00204277&amp;date=2016-12-01&amp;volume=44&amp;issue=6&amp;spage=501&amp;au=Wang%2C+Shijuan%3BMurota%2C+Masao&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=Instructional+Science&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/10.1007%2Fs11251-016-9385-x";ProQuest Central,Social Science Premium Collection
Design and evaluation of a DIY construction system for educational robot kits;"  Building a robot from scratch in an educational context can be a challenging prospect. While a multitude of projects exist that simplify the electronics and software aspects of a robot, the same cannot be said for construction systems for robotics. In this paper, we present our efforts to create a low-cost do-it-yourself construction system for small robots. We have created three different construction systems (laser-cut screw connectors, printed friction-fit connectors, and printed hybrid connectors) using small aluminium T-slot extrusions, based on prior work done by Industrial Design college students. Eighty-six secondary school students and 35 teachers tested these three systems during a five-day robotics contest where they had to build firefighting robots. Follow-up questionnaires and an expert evaluation were used to measure the usability, affective appraisal and functionality of the three systems in order to determine which system should serve as a basis for further design iterations. Overall, a clear preference was shown for the hybrid system, which relies on its interlocking shape as well as on a screw connection to create robot frames that are both quick to construct and very rigid once assembled. We believe our work represents a solid first step toward an inexpensive, ""hackable"" construction system for educational robotics.";1828125376;Scholarly Journals;;"Vandevelde, Cesar;Wyffels, Francis;Ciocci, Maria-cristina;Vanderborght, Bram;Saldien, Jelle";;; Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht 2016; 10.1007/s10798-015-9324-1; Journal Article;; Nov 2016;;0957-7572;4; English; English; 521-540; Dordrecht;Nov 2016;International Journal of Technology and Design Education;2016;26;https://search.proquest.com/docview/1828125376?accountid=11774;;;;;; 521;; Instructional design , Do it yourself--DIY , Robots , Education; Educational robotics , STEM , DIY , User experience , Construction system , 3D printing;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aeducation&amp;atitle=Design+and+evaluation+of+a+DIY+construction+system+for+educational+robot+kits&amp;title=International+Journal+of+Technology+and+Design+Education&amp;issn=09577572&amp;date=2016-11-01&amp;volume=26&amp;issue=4&amp;spage=521&amp;au=Vandevelde%2C+Cesar%3BWyffels%2C+Francis%3BCiocci%2C+Maria-cristina%3BVanderborght%2C+Bram%3BSaldien%2C+Jelle&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=International+Journal+of+Technology+and+Design+Education&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/10.1007%2Fs10798-015-9324-1";Art, Design & Architecture Collection,ProQuest Central,SciTech Premium Collection,Social Science Premium Collection
Collaborative Environments in Software Engineering Teaching: A FLOSS Approach;  Open development has emerged as a method for creating versatile and complex products through free collaboration of individuals. This free collaboration gathers globally distributed teams. Similarly, it is common today to view businesses and other human organisations as ecosystems, where several participating companies and organisations cooperate and compete together. As an example, Free/Libre Open Source Software (FLOSS) development is one area where community driven development provides a plausible platform for both development of products and establishing a software ecosystem where a set of businesses contribute their own innovations. Equally, open and informal learning environments and open innovation platforms are also gaining ground. While such initiatives are not limited to any specific area, they typically offer a technological, legal, social, and economic framework for development, relying always on people as open development would not exist without the active participation of them. This paper explores the participation of master students in FLOSS projects, while merging two different settings of learning: formal and open/informal education.;1860070351;Conference Papers & Proceedings;;"Fernandes, Sara;Barbosa, Luis Soares";;; Copyright Academic Conferences International Limited Oct 2016;; Feature;; Oct 2016;;2048-8637;; English; English; 201-206; Kidmore End;Oct 2016;European Conference on e-Learning;2016;;https://search.proquest.com/docview/1860070351?accountid=11774;;; References;;; 201;; Students , Learning , Collaboration , Open source software;;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aeducation&amp;atitle=Collaborative+Environments+in+Software+Engineering+Teaching%3A+A+FLOSS+Approach&amp;title=European+Conference+on+e-Learning&amp;issn=20488637&amp;date=2016-10-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=201&amp;au=Fernandes%2C+Sara%3BBarbosa%2C+Luis+Soares&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=European+Conference+on+e-Learning&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/";ProQuest Central,SciTech Premium Collection,Social Science Premium Collection
Academic - Industry Collaboration;  The main contribution of this article lies in the demonstration of real academic - industry collaboration in the field of Software Quality Assurance. This collaboration between universities and business is showed on the example of the Software Quality Assurance Competence Centre (SQA CC) which is a part of the Faculty of Informatics and Statistics at the University of Economics in Prague since 2012. First, the importance of academic - industry collaboration is outlined. Then, the Software Quality Assurance Competence Centre is introduced. To demonstrate services and core activities provided by the competence centre, two successful projects implemented by the SQA CC are presented. The aim of the REGAN (REGression ANalysis) project was to evaluate the possibility of regression testing automation. The methodology for assessing the suitability of regression testing automation together with a method of estimating the labor intensity of automated testing implementation was developed during this project. The second pro - ject is the development of an Integrated Testing Tool that interconnects test management with bug reporting and functional and performance testing. Finally, the main areas that are specific to the competence centre management and contribute to its demanding nature are identified and further discussed in the lessons learned.;1878044458;Scholarly Journals;;Buchalcevova, Alena;;; Copyright Niculescu Publishing House Sep 2016;; Feature;; Sep 2016;;2344-4088;3; English; English; 40-50; Bucharest;Sep 2016;FAIMA Business & Management Journal;2016;4;https://search.proquest.com/docview/1878044458?accountid=11774;;; Photographs , References;;; 40;; Studies , Quality control , Software , Collaboration , Core competencies , Colleges & universities;;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aabiglobal&amp;atitle=Academic+-+Industry+Collaboration&amp;title=FAIMA+Business+%26+Management+Journal&amp;issn=23444088&amp;date=2016-09-01&amp;volume=4&amp;issue=3&amp;spage=40&amp;au=Buchalcevova%2C+Alena&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=FAIMA+Business+%26+Management+Journal&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/";ProQuest Central
Design Thinking in Teaching: Product Concept Creation in the Devlab Program;  This paper summarizes a case study within which the concept of design thinking (Brown 2009) has been used to construct a practical user-centered process to support rapid product concept creation in an entrepreneurship education program. This process has been established within the DevLAB program at the Oulu University of Applied Sciences in Finland which acts as a permanent pre-incubator program for university level students and professionals accessing re-training. Design thinking was chosen as the basis of the program to support interdisciplinary teams that need to work together effectively. Design thinking is useful in this scenario since it is a suitable methodology for projects in any field. It is especially well suited to ill-defined problems. This paper will summarize the context, curriculum and preliminary outcomes associated with this design thinking process. It will also outline how design thinking has become an integral aspect of the development phases that interdisciplinary teams of students go through to build prototypes and create start-ups as part of their studies. While this program is still relatively new, preliminary feedback from participants suggests that the design thinking is an effective model for supporting the development of project work within entrepreneurship education at the higher education level. Ultimately, this case aims to educate people who can apply the tools of design thinking into their careers.;1860088310;Conference Papers & Proceedings;;Karjalainen, Janne;;; Copyright Academic Conferences International Limited Sep 2016;; Feature;; Sep 2016;;2049-1050;; English; English; 359-364; Reading;Sep 2016;European Conference on Innovation and Entrepreneurship;2016;;https://search.proquest.com/docview/1860088310?accountid=11774;;; References;;; 359;; Product design , Innovations , Problems , Memory expansion boards , Studies , Finland;;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Apqrl&amp;atitle=Design+Thinking+in+Teaching%3A+Product+Concept+Creation+in+the+Devlab+Program&amp;title=European+Conference+on+Innovation+and+Entrepreneurship&amp;issn=20491050&amp;date=2016-09-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=359&amp;au=Karjalainen%2C+Janne&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=European+Conference+on+Innovation+and+Entrepreneurship&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/";ProQuest Central
Critical Success Factors to Improve the Game Development Process from a Developer's Perspective;  The growth of the software game development industry is enormous and is gaining importance day by day. This growth imposes severe pressure and a number of issues and challenges on the game development community. Game development is a complex process, and one important game development choice is to consider the developer's perspective to produce good-quality software games by improving the game development process. The objective of this study is to provide a better understanding of the developer's dimension as a factor in software game success. It focuses mainly on an empirical investigation of the effect of key developer's factors on the software game development process and eventually on the quality of the resulting game. A quantitative survey was developed and conducted to identify key developer's factors for an enhanced game development process. For this study, the developed survey was used to test the research model and hypotheses. The results provide evidence that game development organizations must deal with multiple key factors to remain competitive and to handle high pressure in the software game industry. The main contribution of this paper is to investigate empirically the influence of key developer's factors on the game development process.;1816805164;Scholarly Journals;;"Aleem, Saiqa;Capretz, Luiz Fernando;Ahmed, Faheem";;; Springer Science+Business Media New York 2016; 10.1007/s11390-016-1673-z; Feature;; Sep 2016;;1000-9000;5; English; English; 925-950; Beijing;Sep 2016;Journal of Computer Science and Technology;2016;31;https://search.proquest.com/docview/1816805164?accountid=11774;;;;;; 925;; Software engineering , Computer & video games , Product development , Analysis , Studies; developer's perspective , software game , empirical investigation , good-quality game , game development process , game developer's factor;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aabiglobal&amp;atitle=Critical+Success+Factors+to+Improve+the+Game+Development+Process+from+a+Developer%27s+Perspective&amp;title=Journal+of+Computer+Science+and+Technology&amp;issn=10009000&amp;date=2016-09-01&amp;volume=31&amp;issue=5&amp;spage=925&amp;au=Aleem%2C+Saiqa%3BCapretz%2C+Luiz+Fernando%3BAhmed%2C+Faheem&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=Journal+of+Computer+Science+and+Technology&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/10.1007%2Fs11390-016-1673-z";ProQuest Central,SciTech Premium Collection
Investigating the structural relationship for the determinants of cloud computing adoption in education;  This research is one of the first few to investigate the adoption and usage of cloud computing in higher education in the context of developing countries, in this case Thailand. It proposes extending the technology acceptance model to integrate subjective norm, perceived convenience, trust, computer self-efficacy, and software functionality in order to better understand the degree of influence that each has on the adoption of cloud in an educational setting. The instrument development was modified from past studies on technology adoption. Data was collected from two leading universities in Thailand, Mahidol University International College, and Thammasat University. Structural equation modeling was applied to the research, the results of which illustrated that perceived ease of use, perceived usefulness, intention to use, perceived convenience, trust, and software functionality have a statistically positive relationship towards the adoption of cloud computing. However, it is interesting to note that, contrary to most studies, computer self-efficacy and subjective norm did not posit a positive relationship. The research also presents the conclusions, which include a discussion of the findings, the academic and practical implications, and limitations.;1810976076;Scholarly Journals;;"Bhatiasevi, Veera;Naglis, Michael";;; Springer Science+Business Media New York 2016; 10.1007/s10639-015-9376-6; Journal Article;; Sep 2016;;1360-2357;5; English; English; 1197-1223; New York;Sep 2016;Education and Information Technologies;2016;21;https://search.proquest.com/docview/1810976076?accountid=11774;;;;;; 1197;; Higher education , Cloud computing , Information technology , Technology adoption; Cloud computing , Education , Information technology , Information and communications technology , Technology acceptance model;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aeducation&amp;atitle=Investigating+the+structural+relationship+for+the+determinants+of+cloud+computing+adoption+in+education&amp;title=Education+and+Information+Technologies&amp;issn=13602357&amp;date=2016-09-01&amp;volume=21&amp;issue=5&amp;spage=1197&amp;au=Bhatiasevi%2C+Veera%3BNaglis%2C+Michael&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=Education+and+Information+Technologies&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/10.1007%2Fs10639-015-9376-6";ProQuest Central,Social Science Premium Collection
"Defining, designing for, and measuring ""social constructivist digital literacy"" development in learners: a proposed framework";"  This paper offers a newly conceptualized modular framework for digital literacy that defines this concept as a task-driven ""social constructivist digital literacy,"" comprising 6 practice domains grounded in Constructionism and social constructivism: Create, Manage, Publish, Socialize, Research, Surf. The framework articulates possible instructional design and research operationalizations for the concept, based upon a coordinated set of activities centering on student game design. The paper then reports on results of an implementation study involving game design drawing upon the framework, addressing ways in which the practice domains inter-operate when the specified instruction is offered as a coordinated intervention. The study reports change in student engagement in activities within each of the framework's practice domain, as a result of participating in a comprehensive game design learning program, and reports ways in which change in activities at school contribute to change in activities at home, when no homework is required, suggesting transfer. Findings indicate that the 6 practice domains factor and inter-correlate, and that for several practice domains, change in engagement at school correlates to change in at-home engagement. The theoretical perspectives underscoring the definition and conceptualization presented are supported by the empirical findings. Researchers may draw upon this study's framework approach, and specific definition for social constructivist digital literacy, in building towards a more coordinated agenda of comparative research on this concept.";1813637061;Scholarly Journals;;Reynolds, Rebecca;;; Association for Educational Communications and Technology 2016; 10.1007/s11423-015-9423-4; Journal Article;; Aug 2016;;1042-1629;4; English; English; 735-762; New York;Aug 2016;Educational Technology, Research and Development;2016;64;https://search.proquest.com/docview/1813637061?accountid=11774;;;;;; 735;; Modularity , Literacy , Instructional design , Digital divide; Digital literacy , Information literacy , Game design , Digital divide , Constructionism , Social constructivism , Instructional design , Learning objectives;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Apsychology&amp;atitle=Defining%2C+designing+for%2C+and+measuring+%22social+constructivist+digital+literacy%22+development+in+learners%3A+a+proposed+framework&amp;title=Educational+Technology%2C+Research+and+Development&amp;issn=10421629&amp;date=2016-08-01&amp;volume=64&amp;issue=4&amp;spage=735&amp;au=Reynolds%2C+Rebecca&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=Educational+Technology%2C+Research+and+Development&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/10.1007%2Fs11423-015-9423-4";ProQuest Central,Social Science Premium Collection
Predicting academic performance from behavioural and learning data;The volume and quality of data, but also their relevance, are crucial when performing data analysis. In this paper, a study of the influence of different types of data is presented, particularly in the context of educational data obtained from Learning Management Systems (LMSs). These systems provide a large amount of data from the student activity but they usually do not describe the results of the learning process, i.e., they describe the behaviour but not the learning results. The starting hypothesis states that complementing behavioural data with other more relevant data (regarding learning outcomes) can lead to a better analysis of the learning process, that is, in particular it is possible to early predict the student final performance. A learning platform has been specially developed to collect data not just from the usage but also related to the way students learn and progress in training activities. Data of both types are used to build a progressive predictive system for helping in the learning process. This model is based on a classifier that uses the Support Vector Machine technique. As a result, the system obtains a weekly classification of each student as the probability of belonging to one of three classes: high, medium and low performance. The results show that, supplementing behavioural data with learning data allows us to obtain better predictions about the results of the students in a learning system. Moreover, it can be deduced that the use of heterogeneous data enriches the final performance of the prediction algorithms;2254473071;Scholarly Journals;;"VILLAGRÁ-ARNEDO, CARLOS;GALLEGO-DURÁN, FRANCISCO J;PATRICIA COMPAÑ-ROSIQUE;FARAÓN LLORENS-LARGO;Molina-Carmona, Rafael";;; © 2016.

Cognitive Collaboration Found in Cardiac Physiology: Study in Classroom Environment;It is known that periods of intense social interaction result in shared patterns in collaborators’ physiological signals. However, applied quantitative research on collaboration is hindered due to scarcity of objective metrics of teamwork effectiveness. Indeed, especially in the domain of productive, ecologically-valid activity such as programming, there is a lack of evidence for the most effective, affordable and reliable measures of collaboration quality. In this study we investigate synchrony in physiological signals between collaborating computer science students performing pair-programming exercises in a class room environment. We recorded electrocardiography over the course of a 60 minute programming session, using lightweight physiological sensors. We employ correlation of heart-rate variability features to study social psychophysiological compliance of the collaborating students. We found evident physiological compliance in collaborating dyads’ heart-rate variability signals. Furthermore, dyads’ self-reported workload was associated with the physiological compliance. Our results show viability of a novel approach to field measurement using lightweight devices in an uncontrolled environment, and suggest that self-reported collaboration quality can be assessed via physiological signals.;1804473029;Scholarly Journals;;"Ahonen, Lauri;Cowley, Benjamin;Torniainen, Jari;Ukkonen, Antti;Vihavainen, Arto;Puolamäki, Kai";;" University of Helsinki

Course and Student Management System Based on ABET Computing Criteria;  Accreditation is considered as one of the major aspects of ABET, where educational institutions continuously develop the quality of academic programs to achieve it. For the most part of this continuous development needs, the programs determine definite and measured objectives for their students, evaluate their efforts to achieve these objectives, and amend their programs based on the results of that assessment. In addition to providing educational institutions an organized strategy to appraise and develop their programs. The primary focal point to prepare for accreditation is the learning objectives and program outcomes assessment. So, College of Computer and information Sciences (CCIS) at Princess Nourah Bint Abdulrahman (PNU) needs to fulfill ABET criteria to achieve the outcomes. So, CCIS need a system to achieve course assessment matrix without wasting the time and efforts. This system will help the staff members in identifying student learning objectives that are expected to achieve as well as to identify assessment tools and evaluation feedback for each topic. This paper describes Course and Student Management System (CSMS) established to address a course assessment matrix, and help achieve department-stated objectives. Whereas, CSMS is a web based system provides many features to facilitate the creation of articulation matrix, course assessment based on students learning objectives, the student's evaluation and tracking attendance of students. This system is considered as a new method of creating the course assessment matrix that will help the department head, instructors and course coordinator. It is user friendly and interactive interface, saving the time and efforts.;1884161390;Scholarly Journals;;"Sahar A El_Rahman;Shabanah, Sahar S";;; Copyright Modern Education and Computer Science Press May 2016;; Journal Article;; May 2016;;2074-9023;3; English; English;; Hong Kong;May 2016;International Journal of Information Engineering and Electronic Business;2016;8;https://search.proquest.com/docview/1884161390?accountid=11774;;;;;; 1;;; ABET , Accreditation , Articulation Matrix , Course Assessment Matrix , Learning Objectives , Program Outcomes , Web Based;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Ahightechjournals&amp;atitle=Course+and+Student+Management+System+Based+on+ABET+Computing+Criteria&amp;title=International+Journal+of+Information+Engineering+and+Electronic+Business&amp;issn=20749023&amp;date=2016-05-01&amp;volume=8&amp;issue=3&amp;spage=1&amp;au=Sahar+A+El_Rahman%3BShabanah%2C+Sahar+S&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=International+Journal+of+Information+Engineering+and+Electronic+Business&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/";ProQuest Central,SciTech Premium Collection
Identifying 21st Century STEM Competencies Using Workplace Data;"Gaps between science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education and required workplace skills have been identified in industry, academia, and government. Educators acknowledge the need to reform STEM education to better prepare students for their future careers. We pursue this growing interest in the skills needed for STEM disciplines and ask whether frameworks for 21st&#xa0;century skills and engineering education cover all of important STEM competencies. In this study, we identify important STEM competencies and evaluate the relevance of current frameworks applied in education using the standardized job-specific database operated and maintained by the US Department of Labor. Our analysis of the importance of 109 skills, types of knowledge and work activities, revealed 18 skills, seven categories of knowledge, and 27 work activities important for STEM workers. We investigate the perspectives of STEM and non-STEM job incumbents, comparing the importance of each skill, knowledge, and work activity for the two groups. We aimed to condense dimensions of the 52 key areas by categorizing them according to the Katz and Kahn (1978) framework and testing for inter-rater reliability. Our findings show frameworks for 21st&#xa0;century skills and engineering education do not encompass all important STEM competencies. Implications for STEM education programs are discussed, including how they can bridge gaps between education and important workplace competencies.";2259582459;Scholarly Journals; John A.

Examining Student Satisfaction and Gender Differences in Technology-Supported, Blended Learning;"Recently, blended learning has become popular in higher education. In this study, we aim to investigate influential factors that could impact student learning in this young and relatively immature environment. Factors from three perspectives - students themselves, instructors, and institutional support - were examined. Specifically, these factors are students' computer self-efficacy, instructor characteristics, and facilitating conditions. A research model was developed to systematically assess their impacts on students' perceived accomplishment, perceived enjoyment, and satisfaction toward the blended class. We also explored the gender differences by testing the research model on the two genders respectively. Interestingly, we found that for female students all three factors had significant impacts on their perceived accomplishment and perceived enjoyment, which in turn significantly impacted their learning satisfaction; however, for male students, no significant impact was found from computer self-efficacy to either perceived accomplishment or perceived enjoyment (the other two factors were significant).";1915751097;Scholarly Journals;;"Dang, Yan (Mandy);Zhang, Yulei (Gavin);Ravindran, Sury;Osmonbekov, Talai";;; Copyright EDSIG Spring 2016;; Journal Article;; Spring 2016;;1055-3096;2; English; English; 119-130; West Lafayette;Spring 2016;Journal of Information Systems Education;2016;27;https://search.proquest.com/docview/1915751097?accountid=11774;;;;;; 119;; Gender differences , Gender aspects , Online instruction , Decision support systems , Learning , Students , Effectiveness , Blended learning , Student attitudes , Teachers;;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aabiglobal&amp;atitle=Examining+Student+Satisfaction+and+Gender+Differences+in+Technology-Supported%2C+Blended+Learning&amp;title=Journal+of+Information+Systems+Education&amp;issn=10553096&amp;date=2016-04-01&amp;volume=27&amp;issue=2&amp;spage=119&amp;au=Dang%2C+Yan+%28Mandy%29%3BZhang%2C+Yulei+%28Gavin%29%3BRavindran%2C+Sury%3BOsmonbekov%2C+Talai&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=Journal+of+Information+Systems+Education&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/";ProQuest Central,SciTech Premium Collection,Social Science Premium Collection
Blogging for Self-reflection among Pre-service English Language Teachers in Saudi Arabia: An Exploratory Study of Students' Own Reflections;This study examines the involvement of blogging as a novel practice within a graduation project course for undergraduate students. The course involves writing a sound research proposal followed by accomplishing research in one of three main areas of study: linguistics, literature and translation. The participants consisted of fifty-five students learning E nglish as foreign language. They managed to create their own personal blogs, using Blogger, which were personal journals composed of their reflections and understanding of the process of writing a research paper in the form of multimodal literacy. The analysis of the data was qualitatively based through two means: an analysis of blog content and an open-survey for those who create such blogs. The survey includes questions such as whether the participants want to use blogging for other courses or not and why and what the merits and demerits of integrating blogs are with remaining courses. Through this practice, the students started to build on existing writing experience along with maximizing opportunities for autonomous thinking.

Towards a sustainable open educational resources development model: Tapping into the cognitive surplus of student-generated content;Open Educational Resources (OER) have created opportunities for learners around the world. Previous research investigated different OER development models for higher educational institutions and other educational communities. However, maintaining sustainability remains the main challenge of OER projects, as there is a high demand on raising awareness of the value of OER in higher education, as well as the need for expanding a participation base in the OER development process and improving the quality of OER. As a response to these challenges, the research documented in this thesis presents a new OER development model that establishes communities of practices around OER in higher educational institutions, where the knowledge production that takes place inside classrooms provides sustainable resources for the OER development process. OER literature also shows initiatives on engaging students in the OER development process, however, there is a lack of rigor research that shows the principles of engaging students in this process. Hence, this study is focused on identifying the design principles of the sustainable OER development model that engages students in generating OER. The model was designed to establish communities of practice of students and teachers to work collaboratively in generating learning resources. In the context of computing and information technology studies for undergraduate learning environments, students generate a surplus of projects in different study units with some projects repurposed, however, a surplus of projects that are generated on every academic semester are rarely tapped into. This abundance of knowledge production is described as ‘cognitive surplus’ and tapping into it can maximise the value of these projects. Therefore, the proposed OER development model taps into the cognitive surplus of student-generated content, where instead of generating summaries and portfolios, students create learning resources based on the unit topics using content authoring software tools. In this model, teachers work as facilitators and co-creators, providing evaluation of learning resources in order to be published as OER. To engage students in generating learning resources for OER, the learning assessment approach was taken from assessing student projects on reproducing information to a new level where students engaged in structuring, designing, collecting and evaluating content for generating learning resources which was then shared online as OER. These activities maximised students’ responsibilities, because sharing work online motivated them to improve the quality of the learning content. To be able to design a new OER development model, there was a need to understand the characteristics of the learning environment, including students, teachers and the learning material. In addition, developing a pedagogically informed approach to adopt the OER development model in learning environments, which can help with improving students’ learning performance and advance the teaching practices through open educational practices (OEP), was also required.Therefore, to fulfil these requirements, this thesis elaborates on the literature review of the related areas of the OER development model and provides analysis of the emerging concepts and related theories. The thesis also presents and reflects on the stages of model development, refinements and evaluation over the lifetime of the study, and provides practical evidence on the potential sustainability of the model in real-life learning environments.;1941089493;Dissertations & Theses;;Fatayer, Mais M.;;;" Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.";; Dissertation/Thesis;; 2016; 9781073968152;;; English; English;;;2016;PQDT - Global;2016;;https://search.proquest.com/docview/1941089493?accountid=11774; 0447 Instructional Design , 0710 Educational technology; 0447 Instructional Design , 0710 Educational technology;; 0447 Instructional Design , 0710 Educational technology; N.A.;; 0447 Instructional Design , 0710 Educational technology; Instructional Design , Educational technology; http://hdl.handle.net/1959.7/uws:38470 , (UMI)AAI10582965 , Education , Open educational resources;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:Education+Database&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Towards+a+sustainable+open+educational+resources+development+model%3A+Tapping+into+the+cognitive+surplus+of+student-generated+content&amp;issn=&amp;date=2016-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Fatayer%2C+Mais+M.&amp;isbn=9781073968152&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/";ProQuest Central,Social Science Premium Collection
Perceptions of Teachers in a Texas Charter School District Regarding Administrator Strategies that Contribute to Teacher Retention;The purpose of this narrative phenomenological case study was to explore administrator strategies related to teacher retention as perceived by teachers in one Texas charter school district. Face-to-face interviews with 10 teachers who have been retained for at least five years in the selected public charter school district were analyzed in order to discover common patterns within the perceptions of teachers. The researcher found that teachers perceived 19 administrator strategies as contributing to teacher retention. These strategies included being approachable, providing feedback to teachers, accommodating teachers’ needs, recognizing and appreciating teachers, being in classrooms, maintaining a mentoring program, providing professional development based on teachers’ need and choice, supporting teachers with student discipline, setting high and realistic academic expectations, maintaining parental involvement, maintaining team meetings, maintaining good work conditions, maintaining job security, offering salaries that are competitive with surrounding districts, reducing teacher’s workload, and fair and flexible distribution of duties.;1902208179;Dissertations & Theses;;Akdemir, Cuneyt;;;" Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.";; Dissertation/Thesis;; 2016; 978-1-369-77079-7;;; English; English;;;2016;ProQuest Dissertations and Theses;2016;;https://search.proquest.com/docview/1902208179?accountid=11774; 0449 Educational leadership , 0514 School administration; 0449 Educational leadership , 0514 School administration;; 0449 Educational leadership , 0514 School administration;;; 0449 Educational leadership , 0514 School administration; Educational leadership , School administration; Education , Administrator , Charter , Charter school , Retention , Teacher attrition , Teacher retention;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:Education+Database&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Perceptions+of+Teachers+in+a+Texas+Charter+School+District+Regarding+Administrator+Strategies+that+Contribute+to+Teacher+Retention&amp;issn=&amp;date=2016-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Akdemir%2C+Cuneyt&amp;isbn=978-1-369-77079-7&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/";ProQuest Central,Social Science Premium Collection

Reciprocal Partnership: An intervention to enhance mathematics self-efficacy and achievement of first and second-semester college students;Community colleges are calling to support students who are at risk of restricting their career options because they do not have the mathematical groundings to pursue math-related careers. In response, I conceptualize a mathematics intervention program namely, Reciprocal Partnership, which is defined as the collaboration of student dyads to engage in reciprocal learning and teaching under the influence of constructive and collaborative environments that are structured by the Three Learning Situations framework. Reciprocal Partnership is proposed to enrich college students in their mathematical learning and to support their social development during their secondary-tertiary transition for mathematics knowledge and skills are strongly correlated with students’ college success and career aspiration. Therefrom, the purpose of this research is to investigate the effect of Reciprocal Partnership on the mathematics self-efficacy and achievement of first- and second-semester college students through a mixed methods approach. It also examines the structure of Reciprocal Partnership to inform the design of effective intervention programs for mathematical learning. Data from final examination grade, and pre- and post-surveys were analyzed through descriptive and inferential statistics, and were used to cross-validate findings from semi-structured interviews. Quantitative results reveal significant effect of Reciprocal Partnership on the mathematics self-efficacy of only students in the first semester, and no significant effect on the mathematics achievement of both students in the first and second semester. However, qualitative results identify a number of benefits for both groups of students such as gains in mathematical knowledge and skill, confidence, motivation, social connection, and comfort. Results from this study suggest the emphasis of mathematics intervention programs on all three learning situations (exploratory, explanatory, and extensional) over only the explanatory situation to maximize learning outcomes.;1884299340;Dissertations & Theses;;Kwan, Kerry;;;" Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.";; Dissertation/Thesis;; 2016; 978-1-369-67303-6;;; English; English;;;2016;ProQuest Dissertations and Theses;2016;;https://search.proquest.com/docview/1884299340?accountid=11774; 0280 Mathematics education , 0745 Higher education; 0280 Mathematics education , 0745 Higher education;; 0280 Mathematics education , 0745 Higher education;;; 0280 Mathematics education , 0745 Higher education; Mathematics education , Higher education; Education , Collaborative learning , Mathematics intervention program , Mathematics self-efficacy , Reciprocal peer tutoring , Secondary-tertiary transition , Supplemental instruction;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:Education+Database&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Reciprocal+Partnership%3A+An+intervention+to+enhance+mathematics+self-efficacy+and+achievement+of+first+and+second-semester+college+students&amp;issn=&amp;date=2016-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Kwan%2C+Kerry&amp;isbn=978-1-369-67303-6&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/";ProQuest Central,Social Science Premium Collection
STEM professional volunteers in K-12 competition programs: Educator practices and impact on pedagogy;This mixed methods dissertation study explored how secondary school educators in specific K-12 competition programs recruited and deployed STEM professional volunteers. The study explored which practices were viewed as most important, and how practices related to constructivist pedagogy, all from the viewpoint of educators. The non-positivist approach sought new knowledge without pursuing generalized results. Review of the literature uncovered extensive anecdotal information about current practices, and suggested that large investments are made in engaging volunteers. One National Science Foundation-sponsored study was identified, and its recommendations for a sustained research agenda were advanced. Three study phases were performed, one to explore practices and operationalize definitions, a second to rate practice's importance and their relation to pedagogy, and a third to seek explanations. Educators preferred recruiting local, meaning recruiting parents and former students, versus from industry or other employers. Most educators preferred volunteers with mentoring skills, and placing them in direct contact with students, versus deploying volunteers to help with behind-the-scenes tasks supporting the educator. Relationships were identified between the highest-rated practices and constructivism in programs. In STEM professional volunteers, educators see affordances, in the same way a classroom tool opens affordances. A model is proposed which shows educators considering practicality, pedagogy, knowledge and skills, and rapport when accessing the affordances opened by STEM professional volunteers. Benefits are maximized when programs align with strong industry clusters in the community.;1883718749;Dissertations & Theses;;Zintgraff, Alfred Clifton;;;" Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.";; Dissertation/Thesis;; 2016; 978-1-369-67197-1;;; English; English;;;2016;ProQuest Dissertations and Theses;2016;;https://search.proquest.com/docview/1883718749?accountid=11774; 0280 Mathematics education , 0710 Educational technology , 0714 Science education; 0280 Mathematics education , 0710 Educational technology , 0714 Science education;; 0280 Mathematics education , 0710 Educational technology , 0714 Science education;;; 0280 Mathematics education , 0710 Educational technology , 0714 Science education; Mathematics education , Educational technology , Science education; Education , Competition , Constructivism , Educators , Industry , K-12 , Mentors , Pedagogy , STEM , Teachers , Volunteers;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:Education+Database&amp;atitle=&amp;title=STEM+professional+volunteers+in+K-12+competition+programs%3A+Educator+practices+and+impact+on+pedagogy&amp;issn=&amp;date=2016-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Zintgraff%2C+Alfred+Clifton&amp;isbn=978-1-369-67197-1&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/";ProQuest Central,Social Science Premium Collection
Engineering the Curriculum: Towards an Adaptive Curriculum;The curriculum is one of the most important artefacts produced by higher education institutions, yet it is one of the least studied. Additionally, little is known about the decision-making of academics when designing and developing their curricula, nor how they make use of them. This research investigates how 22 Australian higher education engineering, software engineering, computer science, and information systems academics conceive of curriculum, what approaches they take when designing, and developing course and program curricula, and what use they make of the curriculum. It also considers the implications of these conceptions and behaviour upon their curricula. Data were collected through a series of one-to-one, in-depth, qualitative interviews as well as small focus group sessions and were analysed following Charmaz' (2006) approach to grounded theory. In this thesis, I argue that the development of curricula for new higher degree programs and courses and / or the updating and innovating of an existing curriculum is a design problem. I also argue that curriculum is a complex adaptive system. Surrounding the design and development of a curriculum is a process of design that leads to the creation of a designed object—the official-curriculum. The official-curriculum provides the guiding principles for its implementation, which involves the design and development of the curriculum-in-use, its delivery, and evaluation. Data show that while the participants conceive of curriculum as a problem of design involving a design process leading to the development of the official-curriculum, surprisingly, their behaviour does not match their conceptions. Over a very short period, their behaviour leads to a process I have called curriculum drift where the official-curriculum and the curriculum-in-use drift away from each other causing the curriculum to lose its integrity. Curricular integrity is characterised through the attributes of alignment, coherence, and cohesiveness. Without integrity, a curriculum is unlikely to be able to deliver all its required outcomes. Utilising the concepts of system dynamics and systems thinking I propose that not only is the curriculum a complex adaptive system, it is a multi-dimensional object. Adopting this notion facilitates possible interventions that may be used to monitor the curriculum and to moderate the effects of curriculum drift . I argue that using the articulated purpose of the curriculum to determine the desired outcomes of that curriculum will enhance curricular alignment, leading to improved student learning and outcomes. Furthermore, perceiving the curriculum as a multi-dimensional object reinforces the proposition that aligning the purpose and desired outcomes of each course with those of the program will achieve improved desired outcomes from the program as a whole. The original contributions to knowledge arising from this research are curriculum drift , an enhanced approach to the curricular alignment, and a multi-dimensional view of curriculum. Perhaps the most important implication of this research, is insight into how we might incorporate curriculum drift into curriculum review models. Successful incorporation has the potential to deliver increased quality of educational outcomes by enabling innovation whilst maintaining the integrity of the curriculum.;1883342830;Dissertations & Theses;;Johns-Boast, Lynette Frances;;;" Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.";; Dissertation/Thesis;; 2016; 9781083576477;;; English; English;;;2016;PQDT - Global;2016;;https://search.proquest.com/docview/1883342830?accountid=11774; 0537 Engineering , 0714 Science education , 0727 Curriculum development , 0745 Higher education; 0537 Engineering , 0714 Science education , 0727 Curriculum development , 0745 Higher education;; 0537 Engineering , 0714 Science education , 0727 Curriculum development , 0745 Higher education; N.A.;; 0537 Engineering , 0714 Science education , 0727 Curriculum development , 0745 Higher education; Engineering , Science education , Curriculum development , Higher education; https://openresearch-repository.anu.edu.au/handle/1885/110397 , (UMI)AAI10587496 , Applied sciences , Education , Engineering education;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:Education+Database&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Engineering+the+Curriculum%3A+Towards+an+Adaptive+Curriculum&amp;issn=&amp;date=2016-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Johns-Boast%2C+Lynette+Frances&amp;isbn=9781083576477&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/";ProQuest Central,SciTech Premium Collection,Social Science Premium Collection
Factors influencing parental attitudes toward digital game-based learning;The purpose of this non-positivistic mixed-methods study is to examine parental attitudes towards the use of computer and video games in their child’s classroom and to investigate how the sociocultural contexts in which parents live affect those attitudes. The research was conducted using a mixed-methods triangulation design, including both quantitative and qualitative techniques. First, the study tried to identify which groups of parents were better positioned to accept and support digital game-based learning and which groups were less likely to have a positive attitude toward integrating digital games into the classroom. This study tried to determine if socioeconomic status, age, education level, and/or cultural background could serve as a predictor of parental attitudes toward digital game-based learning. Second, the study tried to recognize how social and cultural contexts in which parents live affect their attitudes toward digital games in the classroom. Many researchers agree that parents play an important role in students’ and eventually, educators’ attitudes toward gaming. It has been argued that if parents accept a certain non-traditional (digital) learning tool, then their children would most likely have a similar attitude toward it. Parents might be the support system that educators need in order to ensure that students are able to see the educational value of video games and are willing to think critically and draw connections between what they learn in a gaming environment and core subject areas.;1871265364;Dissertations & Theses;;Piller, Yulia;;;" Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.";; Dissertation/Thesis;; 2016; 978-1-369-52196-2;;; English; English;;;2016;ProQuest Dissertations and Theses;2016;;https://search.proquest.com/docview/1871265364?accountid=11774; 0515 Education; 0515 Education;; 0515 Education;;; 0515 Education; Education; Education , Attitude theory , Digital game-based learning , Game-based learning , Parental attitudes , Social norm;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:Education+Database&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Factors+influencing+parental+attitudes+toward+digital+game-based+learning&amp;issn=&amp;date=2016-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Piller%2C+Yulia&amp;isbn=978-1-369-52196-2&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/";ProQuest Central,Social Science Premium Collection
Exploring the Influence of Design Thinking on the Decision Making of Army Leaders;Military operations conducted in an asymmetric environment challenges the creative and critical thinking skills of Army leaders. An objective exploration of the influence of design thinking within Army doctrine was clearly appropriate to assess the level of influence experienced by Army leaders as they employed design thinking doctrine during problem solving and decision making activities. The United States Army introduced the concept of design thinking into their doctrine at the Command and General Staff College (CGSC) as a means of educating officers in how to apply critical and creative thinking techniques to solve complex ill-structured problems. The nature of conflict around the world has shifted toward an asymmetric environment as the enemy employs terrorist tactics as a means to further their political or ideological agenda. The U.S. Army responded to this shift in environments by adapting the design thinking concept within their doctrine entitled Army Design Methodology. The fundamental pretext of design thinking better prepares Army leaders by improving their abilities to apply creative and critical thinking skills as they conduct military operations in the ever-changing environment. The purpose of this generic qualitative research was to explore perceptions of how design thinking influenced Army commanders or their staff during problem solving and decision-making efforts in support of military operations. A selection of graduates from the Army School of Advanced Military Studies served as the target population for this survey. This qualitative research study evaluated their perceptions of how Army Design Methodology influenced their abilities to engage in problem solving and decision-making. The finding in this research study indicate Army Design Methodology enjoys a significant level of influence, and was applied to solve large problems and was employed predominantly at the division level and above. Challenges occurred as confusion existed when applying Army Design Methodology on simple problems or applied incorrectly. Resistance to the use of Army Design Methodology appeared to have been influenced in some measure by existing Army culture. Conclusions of this research indicate the implementation of an information campaign, which consists of both training and education is appropriate to institutionalize a better understanding of Army Design Methodology.;1868501434;Dissertations & Theses;;Kitzhaber, Gerry L.;;;" Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.";; Dissertation/Thesis;; 2016; 978-1-369-50951-9;;; English; English;;;2016;ProQuest Dissertations and Theses;2016;;https://search.proquest.com/docview/1868501434?accountid=11774; 0310 Business administration , 0454 Management , 0750 Military studies; 0310 Business administration , 0454 Management , 0750 Military studies;; 0310 Business administration , 0454 Management , 0750 Military studies;;; 0310 Business administration , 0454 Management , 0750 Military studies; Business administration , Management , Military studies; Social sciences , Army design methodology , Decision making , Design thinking;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:Military+Database&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Exploring+the+Influence+of+Design+Thinking+on+the+Decision+Making+of+Army+Leaders&amp;issn=&amp;date=2016-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Kitzhaber%2C+Gerry+L.&amp;isbn=978-1-369-50951-9&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/";ProQuest Central
Exploring the role of community in online learning;Distance education is growing rapidly at the post-secondary level in Canada. Despite the growing popularity of online learning in higher education, distance education often suffers from high dropout rates, which have been attributed to the physical separation of students. Such separation tends to give rise to feelings of isolation and disconnection. According to the literature, these feelings can be overcome by fostering a sense of community, that is a sense of belonging and interactivity among online learners. While a growing body of literature emphasizes the importance of fostering a community in online course communities, it is not clear how this is best accomplished. There is neither an accepted set of rules or strategies nor clearly defined steps in the development of a community in online course communities. In addition, the research on the effects of a community on learning is mixed. A few scholars criticize existing research for failing to demonstrate the role of community in learning through rigorous empirical studies. My research is concerned with this gap in the literature. So far, current research has made little progress in providing answers concerning the role of community. Findings from this study revealed that strong community levels were associated with instructor-facilitated online course communities, whereas weak community levels were associated with peer-facilitated online course communities. Students in the online course communities with stronger community levels, posted more notes, replied to more notes, and reread notes more often. They also spent more time revising the notes that they posted. Most interestingly, students in the online course communities with stronger community levels were more likely to link to and ‘Like’ their classmates’ notes. Furthermore, unlike their peers from online course communities with weaker community levels, students from online course communities with stronger community levels believed that they learned more because they had access to their professor and their peers’ ideas, and also expressed their enjoyment of the online course community discussions. It was also found that instructors from online course communities with stronger community levels were more hands-on than those from online course communities with weaker community levels. Considering these findings, I argue that fostering a sense of community in online course communities enhances social capital through the creation of relationships. This produces better student outcomes, deeper learning and more positive online learning experiences for students.;1868415786;Dissertations & Theses;;Phirangee, Krystle Shivana;;;" Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.";; Dissertation/Thesis;; 2016; 978-1-369-47860-0;;; English; English;;;2016;ProQuest Dissertations and Theses;2016;;https://search.proquest.com/docview/1868415786?accountid=11774; 0710 Educational technology; 0710 Educational technology;; 0710 Educational technology;;; 0710 Educational technology; Educational technology; Education , Community , Facilitation methods , Online behaviours , Online learning;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:Education+Database&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Exploring+the+role+of+community+in+online+learning&amp;issn=&amp;date=2016-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Phirangee%2C+Krystle+Shivana&amp;isbn=978-1-369-47860-0&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/";ProQuest Central,Social Science Premium Collection
Employee Engagement for Change Readiness: A Qualitative Exploration of the Dynamics of Middle Management Communication;Although change management has been a relevant topic in recent literature, the success rate of process changes has been lower than managements’ expectations. This study aimed to provide components of middle management communication, which can increase employee engagement, during the change readiness phase of a process change. This was accomplished through an exploratory qualitative method of data collection and analysis, specifically semi-structured interviews and thematic analysis of a maximum variation sample of employees and middle managers that experienced a process change. The interviews were conducted with 14 practitioners, 11 employees and three middle managers of public organizations, private organizations, and government agencies. These interview data were sorted into five themes of employee engagement and middle management communication, which are employee readiness, communication, social dynamics, trust, and self-efficacy, which were identified in the literature review. This allowed for subthemes to emerge from these sorted data. The process change subthemes from employee and middle manager interview data were compared to identify identical subthemes. These combined subthemes were compared and contrasted with subthemes from the current literature. The study concluded that these interview data supported the five themes. In addition, there are proposed subthemes to consider when creating a change communication strategy to engage employees in the change readiness phase of a process change.;1868415468;Dissertations & Theses;;Ward, Jason L.;;;" Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.";; Dissertation/Thesis;; 2016; 978-1-369-45410-9;;; English; English;;;2016;ProQuest Dissertations and Theses;2016;;https://search.proquest.com/docview/1868415468?accountid=11774; 0454 Management , 0459 Communication; 0454 Management , 0459 Communication;; 0454 Management , 0459 Communication;;; 0454 Management , 0459 Communication; Management , Communication; Social sciences , Communication and the arts , Change management , Change readiness , Communication theory , Employee engagement , Middle management communication , Organizational management;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ABI%2FINFORM+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Employee+Engagement+for+Change+Readiness%3A+A+Qualitative+Exploration+of+the+Dynamics+of+Middle+Management+Communication&amp;issn=&amp;date=2016-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Ward%2C+Jason+L.&amp;isbn=978-1-369-45410-9&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/";ProQuest Central,Social Science Premium Collection
Teachers in the Making: An investigation of pre-service teacher experience in a maker faire setting, and the role of design thinking;This qualitative research project applies a case study approach to investigating the nature of experience and interactions of four pre-service teachers who took part in facilitating an activity for a School Maker Faire. Additionally, the research looks for evidence of design thinking as a pedagogical practice, manifested by pre-service teachers in this environment. Data was collected in the form of stimulated recall interviews and semi-structured interviews. Analysis of the data was guided by the following three questions: • What is the experience of pre-service teachers in a Maker Faire environment? • How do pre-service teachers interact with children in a Maker Faire? • How do pre-service teachers display their pedagogical understanding of design thinking, in a Maker Faire environment? Findings reveal the following four phenomena as being important influences on interaction and experience: pre-Maker Faire preparation, types of questions asked, the role of assessment, and the role of parents. Additionally, evidence suggests relationships between these influences and a pre-service teacher’s level of adopting design thinking, however further research would be necessary in order to substantiate these findings to a degree of applicability for practitioners. This research study contributes to the growing literature on maker education and design thinking, as it applies to teacher education.;1867760132;Dissertations & Theses;;O'Brien, Sean Michael;;;" Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.";; Dissertation/Thesis;; 2016; 978-1-369-57666-5;;; English; English;;;2016;ProQuest Dissertations and Theses;2016;;https://search.proquest.com/docview/1867760132?accountid=11774; 0530 Teacher education; 0530 Teacher education;; 0530 Teacher education;;; 0530 Teacher education; Teacher education; Education , Design thinking , Maker education , Pre-service teachers , Teacher education;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:Education+Database&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Teachers+in+the+Making%3A+An+investigation+of+pre-service+teacher+experience+in+a+maker+faire+setting%2C+and+the+role+of+design+thinking&amp;issn=&amp;date=2016-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=O%27Brien%2C+Sean+Michael&amp;isbn=978-1-369-57666-5&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/";ProQuest Central,Social Science Premium Collection
Gamification in higher education: Not a trivial pursuit;Gamification is being touted as the next innovative wave in education and as a tool that can solve many of the problems faced by higher education today. Increasing student engagement and retention of information are two of the results said to be had through gamification. This study serves as a primer on gamification for tertiary educators. It explores the parameters of gamification (as opposed to game-based learning), the variations and levels of gamification and what results can be expected from differing levels of gamification. This study addresses some of the concerns and issues with gamification. This study also includes a method of gamifying analog-based, higher education courses.;1864629078;Dissertations & Theses;;Campbell, Andrea Ann;;;" Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.";; Dissertation/Thesis;; 2016; 978-1-369-42891-9;;; English; English;;;2016;ProQuest Dissertations and Theses;2016;;https://search.proquest.com/docview/1864629078?accountid=11774; 0459 Communication , 0745 Higher education; 0459 Communication , 0745 Higher education;; 0459 Communication , 0745 Higher education;;; 0459 Communication , 0745 Higher education; Communication , Higher education; Communication and the arts , Education , Game-based learning , Gameful design , Gamification , Structural gamification;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:Education+Database&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Gamification+in+higher+education%3A+Not+a+trivial+pursuit&amp;issn=&amp;date=2016-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Campbell%2C+Andrea+Ann&amp;isbn=978-1-369-42891-9&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/";ProQuest Central,Social Science Premium Collection
International Students' Use of Technology for Improving Writing Skills in College;"Many college-level students choose to study in another country and in a second language, often in English. In this context, a high standard of written English is important to attain good grades in college and earn degrees with distinction, which may lead to successful careers. One international college provided computer tools to students to improve their writing; however, students were reluctant to use the tools provided. This qualitative study explored these college students’ perceptions of their lack of motivation to use computer tools and the barriers that prevent them from improving their English writing. The research questions investigated the technology available for these English as a Second Language students, their motivation to use error correction tools, barriers to their use, and attitudes to writing well in English. This study used the social constructivist theory as its theoretical framework that students learn by interacting with others. Semi structured interviews were conducted with 20 students, and 2 focus groups of 5 participants. All were selected purposefully. Data were open coded and thematically analyzed and 4 themes emerged. The four themes were technology and its uses, user preferences, writing, and motivation. The results indicated that the participants preferred to consult teachers, with technology as an aid, and used error correction tools only as a last resort. A total immersion writing development program with follow-up mentoring was developed to improve incoming international students’ writing skills and to build their confidence in the use of technology. The emergent information from this study is intended for use by students, staff, and faculty to improve international students’ English language acquisition, academic achievement, and professional success.";1864628696;Dissertations & Theses;;Godwin, Margaret;;;" Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.";; Dissertation/Thesis;; 2016; 978-1-369-43891-8;;; English; English;;;2016;ProQuest Dissertations and Theses;2016;;https://search.proquest.com/docview/1864628696?accountid=11774; 0515 Education , 0679 Language; 0515 Education , 0679 Language;; 0515 Education , 0679 Language;;; 0515 Education , 0679 Language; Education , Language , Qualitative research , Academic achievement , Elementary school students , College students , Student attitudes , Motivation , Language attitudes , Occupations , English as an international language , Second language teachers , International languages , Second language writing , English as a second language instruction; Language, literature and linguistics , Education , Motivation , Second language , Technology , Writing skills;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:Education+Database&amp;atitle=&amp;title=International+Students%27+Use+of+Technology+for+Improving+Writing+Skills+in+College&amp;issn=&amp;date=2016-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Godwin%2C+Margaret&amp;isbn=978-1-369-43891-8&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/";ProQuest Central,Social Science Premium Collection
Differences between elementary, middle, and secondary teachers' perceptions and implementation of cooperative learning strategies;The purpose of this quantitative, causal-comparative study was to find potential differences in perceptions toward cooperative learning implementation (expectancy of success, perceived value, and perceived cost) and current teaching practices among groups of teachers, using the Cooperative Learning Implementation Questionnaire (CLIQ) instrument developed by Abrami, Poulsen, and Chambers (1998). The participants were part of a convenience sample of elementary teachers, n = 60, middle school teachers, n = 44, and secondary teachers, n = 45 in seven central Ohio public school districts. The research utilized a MANOVA to determine if there was a statistically significant difference in mean CLIQ subscale scores, (a) overall CLIQ scores, (b) expectancy of success, (c) perceived value, (d) perceived cost, and (e) current teaching practices between three groups of teachers (elementary, middle, secondary). The results for the MANOVA indicated that elementary, middle, and secondary teachers have similar perceptions of cooperative learning and similar current teaching practices for cooperative learning F ( 2, 148 )=1.62, p = .10, η 2 =.05 and no difference was found among the groups. The researcher also provided additional discussion, implications, and suggestions for further research.;1861205735;Dissertations & Theses;;Fausnaugh, Ronald Eugene, III;;;" Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.";; Dissertation/Thesis;; 2016; 978-1-369-40882-9;;; English; English;;;2016;ProQuest Dissertations and Theses;2016;;https://search.proquest.com/docview/1861205735?accountid=11774; 0449 Educational leadership , 0515 Education , 0530 Teacher education; 0449 Educational leadership , 0515 Education , 0530 Teacher education;; 0449 Educational leadership , 0515 Education , 0530 Teacher education;;; 0449 Educational leadership , 0515 Education , 0530 Teacher education; Educational leadership , Education , Teacher education; Education , Cooperative learning , Current teaching practices , Expectancy of success , Perceived cost , Perceived value , Teacher implementation;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:Education+Database&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Differences+between+elementary%2C+middle%2C+and+secondary+teachers%27+perceptions+and+implementation+of+cooperative+learning+strategies&amp;issn=&amp;date=2016-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Fausnaugh%2C+Ronald+Eugene%2C+III&amp;isbn=978-1-369-40882-9&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/";ProQuest Central,Social Science Premium Collection
A case study to determine if HOI-STEM courses influenced students' decisions toward continuing their studies in the HOI-STEM areas;The purpose of this study is to survey the experiences of the 9-12 grade students who have and have not been enrolled in an HOI-STEM curriculum in order to determine how/if enrollment in such a curriculum influences their choices toward continued study in STEM fields. The study found that indeed the students enrolled in the hands-on type of classes were excited about their education and the classes they enrolled in. The students who had not enrolled in HOI-STEM echoed the same sentiment. They may have been enrolled in art, or music, or social studies but they also reported that being able to interact with the curriculum, to be engaged in non-traditional hands-on activities enabled them to become more immersed in their education. The researcher can then report that the concept of “Hands On Integrated-Science Technology Engineering Math”, (HOI-STEM), classes should be expanded and integrated into the curriculum for K-12 classes.;1858815067;Dissertations & Theses;;Kling, Richard R.;;;" Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.";; Dissertation/Thesis;; 2016; 978-1-369-48309-3;;; English; English;;;2016;ProQuest Dissertations and Theses;2016;;https://search.proquest.com/docview/1858815067?accountid=11774; 0280 Mathematics education , 0537 Engineering , 0714 Science education; 0280 Mathematics education , 0537 Engineering , 0714 Science education;; 0280 Mathematics education , 0537 Engineering , 0714 Science education;;; 0280 Mathematics education , 0537 Engineering , 0714 Science education; Mathematics education , Engineering , Science education; Applied sciences , Education , Hands-on interactive , STEM education , Science, technology, engineering and mathematics;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:Matericals+Science+%26+Engineering+Dissertations&amp;atitle=&amp;title=A+case+study+to+determine+if+HOI-STEM+courses+influenced+students%27+decisions+toward+continuing+their+studies+in+the+HOI-STEM+areas&amp;issn=&amp;date=2016-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Kling%2C+Richard+R.&amp;isbn=978-1-369-48309-3&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/";SciTech Premium Collection
Experiential learning in control systems laboratories and engineering project management;Experiential learning is a process by which a student creates knowledge through the insights gained from an experience. Kolb's model of experiential learning is a cycle of four modes: (1) concrete experience, (2) reflective observation, (3) abstract conceptualization, and (4) active experimentation. His model is used in each of the three studies presented in this dissertation. Laboratories are a popular way to apply the experiential learning modes in STEM courses. Laboratory kits allow students to take home laboratory equipment to complete experiments on their own time. Although students like laboratory kits, no previous studies compared student learning outcomes on assignments using laboratory kits with existing laboratory equipment. In this study, we examined the similarities and differences between the experiences of students who used a portable laboratory kit and students who used the traditional equipment. During the 2014- 2015 academic year, we conducted a quasi-experiment to compare students' achievement of learning outcomes and their experiences in the instructional laboratory for an introductory control systems course. Half of the laboratory sections in each semester used the existing equipment, while the other sections used a new kit. We collected both quantitative data and qualitative data. We did not identify any major differences in the student experience based on the equipment they used. Course objectives, like research objectives and product requirements, help provide clarity and direction for faculty and students. Unfortunately, course and laboratory objectives are not always clearly stated. Without a clear set of objectives, it can be hard to design a learning experience and determine whether students are achieving the intended outcomes of the course or laboratory. In this study, I identified a common set of laboratory objectives, concepts, and components of a laboratory apparatus for undergraduate control systems laboratories. During the summer of 2015, a panel of 40 control systems faculty members, from a variety of institutions, completed a multi-round Delphi survey in order to bring them toward consensus on the common aspects of their laboratories. The following winter, 45 additional faculty members and practitioners from the control systems community completed a follow-up survey to gather feedback on the results of the Delphi survey. During the Delphi study, the panelists identified 15 laboratory objectives, 26 concepts, and 15 components that were common in their laboratories. Then in both the Delphi survey and follow-up survey each participant rated the importance of each of these items. While the average ratings differed slightly between the two groups, the order of each set of items was compared with two different tests and the order was found to be similar. Some of the common and important learning objectives include connecting theory to what is implemented and observed in the laboratory, designing controllers, and modeling and simulating systems. The most common component in both groups was Math-Works software. Some of the common concepts include block diagrams, stability, and PID control. Defining common aspects of undergraduate control systems laboratories enables common development, detailed comparisons, and simplified adaptation of equipment and experiments between campuses and programs. Throughout an undergraduate program in engineering, there are multiple opportunities for hands-on laboratory experiences that are related to course content. However, a similarly immersive experience for project management graduate students is harder to incorporate for all students in a course at once. This study explores an experiential learning opportunity for graduate students in engineering management or project management programs. The project management students enroll in a project management course. Undergraduate students interested in working on a project with a real customer enroll in a different projects course. Two students from the project management course function as project managers and lead a team of undergraduate students in the second course through a project. I studied how closely the project management experience in these courses aligns with engineering project management in industry. In the spring of 2015, I enrolled in the project management course at a large Midwestern university. I used analytic autoethnography to compare my experiences in the course with my experiences as a project engineer at a large aerospace company. I found that the experience in the course provided an authentic and comprehensive opportunity to practice most of the skills listed in the Project Management Book of Knowledge (an industry standard) as necessary for project managers. Some components of the course that made it successful: I was the project manager for the whole term, I worked with a real client, and the team defined and delivered the project before the end of the semester.;1857503045;Dissertations & Theses;;Reck, Rebecca Marie;;;" Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.";; Dissertation/Thesis;; 2016; 978-1-369-46769-7;;; English; English;;;2016;ProQuest Dissertations and Theses;2016;;https://search.proquest.com/docview/1857503045?accountid=11774; 0537 Engineering , 0714 Science education , 0745 Higher education; 0537 Engineering , 0714 Science education , 0745 Higher education;; 0537 Engineering , 0714 Science education , 0745 Higher education;;; 0537 Engineering , 0714 Science education , 0745 Higher education; Engineering , Science education , Higher education; Applied sciences , Education , Control systems , Delphi survey , Education , Engineering , Engineering and mathematics , Engineering education , Experiential learning , Lab kit , Laboratories , Project management , Science , Technology;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:Education+Database&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Experiential+learning+in+control+systems+laboratories+and+engineering+project+management&amp;issn=&amp;date=2016-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Reck%2C+Rebecca+Marie&amp;isbn=978-1-369-46769-7&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/";ProQuest Central,SciTech Premium Collection,Social Science Premium Collection
Persistence, Major, Vocational Technical Preparation, and Provisional Acceptance at a Private For-Profit Hospitality College;At a private for-profit hospitality college in Philadelphia, there are rising percentages of students not persisting to the sophomore year. The study was grounded by the theoretical framework of Tinto’s model of student retention. The purpose of this causal comparative study was to examine the relationship between student persistence and the academic variables of major, vocational technical preparation, and provisional acceptance. The relationship was analyzed using a chi-square test of independence. The data collected for the study came from archival data based upon the sample of 162 full-time students enrolled during the August 2014 class start in the majors of Culinary Arts, Pastry Arts, Restaurant Management, and Hotel Management. The results displayed that persistence is dependent on the student major of choice and students who had vocational technical preparation. However, the results displayed that persistence was most likely independent of students who were provisionally accepted, suggesting that provisional acceptance had no influence on whether students persisted from freshmen to sophomore year or not. The implications for positive social change on the local level include providing research-based findings on variables associated with first-year student persistence to inform targeted student support services and ultimately improve student persistence at the institution studied. A professional development workshop has been created to educate faculty and staff at the college about the results of the study. The implications for positive social change outside of the institution include a higher number of students who are qualified to obtain jobs and positively help their communities grow and develop.;1848269056;Dissertations & Theses;;Seery, Joshua L.;;;" Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.";; Dissertation/Thesis;; 2016; 978-1-369-24517-2;;; English; English;;;2016;ProQuest Dissertations and Theses;2016;;https://search.proquest.com/docview/1848269056?accountid=11774; 0443 Educational evaluation , 0446 Higher Education Administration , 0515 Education; 0443 Educational evaluation , 0446 Higher Education Administration , 0515 Education;; 0443 Educational evaluation , 0446 Higher Education Administration , 0515 Education;;; 0443 Educational evaluation , 0446 Higher Education Administration , 0515 Education; Educational evaluation , Higher Education Administration , Education; Education , Hospitality college , Major , Persistence , Provisional acceptance , Retention , Vocational technical education;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:Education+Database&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Persistence%2C+Major%2C+Vocational+Technical+Preparation%2C+and+Provisional+Acceptance+at+a+Private+For-Profit+Hospitality+College&amp;issn=&amp;date=2016-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Seery%2C+Joshua+L.&amp;isbn=978-1-369-24517-2&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/";ProQuest Central,Social Science Premium Collection
Peer review in design: Understanding the impact of collaboration on the review process and student perception;A cornerstone of design and design education is frequent situated feedback. With increasing class sizes, and shrinking financial and human resources, providing rich feedback to students becomes increasingly difficult. In the field of writing, web-based peer review—the process of utilizing equal status learners within a class to provide feedback to each other on their work using networked computing systems—has been shown to be a reliable and valid source of feedback in addition to improving student learning. Designers communicate in myriad ways, using the many languages of design and combining visual and descriptive information. This complex discourse of design intent makes peer reviews by design students ambiguous and often not helpful to the receivers of this feedback. Furthermore, engaging students in the review process itself is often difficult. Teams can complement individual diversity and may assist novice designers collectively resolve complex task. However, teams often incur production losses and may be impacted by individual biases. In the current work, we look at utilizing a collaborative team of reviewers, working collectively and synchronously, in generating web based peer reviews in a sophomore engineering design class. Students participated in a cross-over design, conducting peer reviews as individuals and collaborative teams in parallel sequences. Raters coded the feedback generated on the basis of their appropriateness and accuracy. Self-report surveys and passive observation of teams conducting reviews captured student opinion on the process, its value, and the contrasting experience they had conducting team and individual reviews. We found team reviews generated better quality feedback in comparison to individual reviews. Furthermore, students preferred conducting reviews in teams, finding the process ‘fun’ and engaging. We observed several learning benefits of using collaboration in reviewing including improved understanding of the assessment criteria, roles, expectations, and increased team reflection. These results provide insight into how to improve the review process for instructors and researchers, and forms a basis for future research work in this area. With respect to facilitating peer review process in design based classrooms, we also present recommendations for creating effective review system design and implementation in classroom supported by research and practical experience.;1847031982;Dissertations & Theses;;Mandala, Mahender Arjun;;;" Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.";; Dissertation/Thesis;; 2016; 978-1-369-41826-2;;; English; English;;;2016;ProQuest Dissertations and Theses;2016;;https://search.proquest.com/docview/1847031982?accountid=11774; 0443 Educational evaluation , 0537 Engineering , 0714 Science education; 0443 Educational evaluation , 0537 Engineering , 0714 Science education;; 0443 Educational evaluation , 0537 Engineering , 0714 Science education;;; 0443 Educational evaluation , 0537 Engineering , 0714 Science education; Educational evaluation , Engineering , Science education; Applied sciences , Education , Collaboration , Collective , Design , Feedback , Learning , Peer review;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:Education+Database&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Peer+review+in+design%3A+Understanding+the+impact+of+collaboration+on+the+review+process+and+student+perception&amp;issn=&amp;date=2016-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Mandala%2C+Mahender+Arjun&amp;isbn=978-1-369-41826-2&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/";ProQuest Central,SciTech Premium Collection,Social Science Premium Collection
Learners' Perspectives on How Mobile Computing Devices Usage Interacts with Their Learning;"Because of today’s ever-evolving complex society, lifelong, self-managed, learning has become prominent. Mobile computing devices hold promising options for high school learners studying in conventional and technology-enhanced learning environments. Full-scale technology intervention in schools can be costly, problematic, and controversial, especially when there lacks substantial empirical evidence that students’ learning will be enhanced. Mobile computing technology, while not a panacea for all, is just one intervening mechanism, particularly in helping students develop independent learning skills to navigate their learning pursuits. Knowing and understanding students’ experiences of how mobile devices interact with and influence learning may help school leaders justify and validate funding allocations for mobile computing technology tools as an intervention to improve student achievement. This qualitative exploratory study included an investigation of students’ perceptions on how their use of mobile devices influenced and interacted with their learning approaches and strategies. Using a semi-structured interview protocol to obtain learners’ views, the researcher interviewed 14 key participants—students who use mobile devices and also participated in their high school’s iPad Technology Implementation Program. Common and divergent themes that emerged were: the learners’ primary personal uses of mobile devices (social media, texting, and talking); the limited “hands-on” use of the iPad device; the school district’s no cell phone use in class policy; internet access issues and work-arounds; and use of mobile devices for school-related assignments and related academic purposes. Results revealed an overall assertion that mobile devices have far-reaching benefits to students. Participants lauded school leaders’ technology efforts, but suggested that program refinement and expansion must continue cultivating a school environment where mobile technology use is comprehensively integrated into the total school operations, curricula and learning culture. Ascertaining learner perspectives is vital, considering school leaders’ fiduciary responsibilities regarding investment in technology implementation and sustainment to benefit learners, the workforce, taxpayers and stakeholders. Future research should include middle school students. This data may offer further insight into or corroboration with high school learners’ perspectives.

The Human and Social Aspects of Software Engineering;Researchers in the field of Empirical Software Engineering have been studying software development for a long time. While many of these studies have focused on the artifact of this process, only some have discussed issues that revolve around developers. Even among those studies, most of them view the software development either as a whole (black box) or as a number of individuals. However, we all know that good software is a result of ”teamwork” and ”collaboration”, thus how developers - and other individuals involved in the process - interact with each other and its dynamics have an impact on the artifact. We attempt to answer a few questions within this context with the generic theme of developer interaction and collaboration, and in the same time within the range/interest of Empirical Software Engineering field.;1845291163;Dissertations & Theses;;Gharehyazie, Mohammad;;;" Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.";; Dissertation/Thesis;; 2016; 978-1-369-20201-4;;; English; English;;;2016;ProQuest Dissertations and Theses;2016;;https://search.proquest.com/docview/1845291163?accountid=11774; 0626 Sociology , 0984 Computer science; 0626 Sociology , 0984 Computer science;; 0626 Sociology , 0984 Computer science;;; 0626 Sociology , 0984 Computer science; Sociology , Computer science; Social sciences , Applied sciences , Empirical software engineering , Human interaction , Open-source software , Software engineering;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:Sociology+Database&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+Human+and+Social+Aspects+of+Software+Engineering&amp;issn=&amp;date=2016-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Gharehyazie%2C+Mohammad&amp;isbn=978-1-369-20201-4&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/";ProQuest Central,SciTech Premium Collection,Social Science Premium Collection
Self-efficacy and sense of belonging: A comparative analysis of factors that affect differences in participation in information technology education by gender;"The recruitment and retention of women is a continuing problem in the Information Technology (IT) profession. Despite positive labor statistics for the IT field, American women are underrepresented. The belief that their skill sets are not as credible as their male counterparts keeps qualified women candidates from attaining key IT positions. There will be no growth in representation if women are not enrolling in the advanced degree programs necessary to end the cycle of underrepresentation. While there are a number of studies investigating the reasons for the underrepresentation of women in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) disciplines; there is not an abundance of research that considers the combined role that gender and self-efficacy play. The literature dealing with these issues in IT educational and the IT workforce separately is even more limited and particularly evident is the lack of research on the underrepresentation of women in IT. This dissertation research study explored the sense of inclusion and factors that affect differences in participation in Information Technology (IT) education by gender. An explanatory sequential mixed methods design was used, and it will involve collecting quantitative data via an online survey and then explaining the quantitative results with in-depth qualitative data with interviews.";1842423390;Dissertations & Theses;;Colson, Lenese Michelle;;;" Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.";; Dissertation/Thesis;; 2016; 978-1-369-16064-2;;; English; English;;;2016;ProQuest Dissertations and Theses;2016;;https://search.proquest.com/docview/1842423390?accountid=11774; 0489 Information Technology , 0733 Gender studies , 0745 Higher education; 0489 Information Technology , 0733 Gender studies , 0745 Higher education;; 0489 Information Technology , 0733 Gender studies , 0745 Higher education;;; 0489 Information Technology , 0733 Gender studies , 0745 Higher education; Information Technology , Gender studies , Higher education; Social sciences , Applied sciences , Education , Belonging , STEM , Self-efficacy;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:Education+Database&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Self-efficacy+and+sense+of+belonging%3A+A+comparative+analysis+of+factors+that+affect+differences+in+participation+in+information+technology+education+by+gender&amp;issn=&amp;date=2016-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Colson%2C+Lenese+Michelle&amp;isbn=978-1-369-16064-2&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/";ProQuest Central,Social Science Premium Collection
A Meta-Analysis of Middle School Science Engagement;"Researchers and educational practitioners have long been concerned with declines in science engagement reported by students as they transition into the middle school setting. Though the operationalization of engagement is still nascent, an emerging consensus on a three-faceted model of student engagement has recently emerged in the research literature (Fredricks, Blumenfeld, &amp; Paris, 2004). Thus, a synthesis of existing primary research of early adolescents’ science engagement under this emerging conceptualization was warranted. The results of this meta-analysis indicate that instructional methods, class characteristics and competence predictors had the strongest relationship with self-reported science engagement in early adolescence. These predictors also show the strongest relationship with affective and cognitive engagement sub-types. Though affective and cognitive engagement were well represented in primary studies, behavioral engagement was underrepresented in student self-reports.";1837110561;Dissertations & Theses;;Aker, Leanna B.;;;" Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.";; Dissertation/Thesis;; 2016; 978-1-369-12356-2;;; English; English;;;2016;ProQuest Dissertations and Theses;2016;;https://search.proquest.com/docview/1837110561?accountid=11774; 0450 Middle School education , 0714 Science education; 0450 Middle School education , 0714 Science education;; 0450 Middle School education , 0714 Science education;;; 0450 Middle School education , 0714 Science education; Middle School education , Science education; Education , Early adolescence , Engagement , Meta-analysis , Science , Self-determination theory , Stage-environment fit theory;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:Education+Database&amp;atitle=&amp;title=A+Meta-Analysis+of+Middle+School+Science+Engagement&amp;issn=&amp;date=2016-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Aker%2C+Leanna+B.&amp;isbn=978-1-369-12356-2&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/";ProQuest Central,Social Science Premium Collection

Women in computer science: An interpretative phenomenological analysis exploring common factors contributing to women's selection and persistence in computer science as an academic major;The purpose of this study is to understand the meaning that women make of the social and cultural factors that influence their reasons for entering and remaining in study of computer science. The twenty-first century presents many new challenges in career development and workforce choices for both men and women. Information technology has become the driving force behind many areas of the economy. As this trend continues, it has become essential that U.S. citizens need to pursue a career in technologies, including the computing sciences. Although computer science is a very lucrative profession, many Americans, especially women, are not choosing it as a profession. Recent studies have shown no significant differences in math, technical and science competency between men and women. Therefore, other factors, such as social, cultural, and environmental influences seem to affect women’s decisions in choosing an area of study and career choices. A phenomenological method of qualitative research was used in this study, based on interviews of seven female students who are currently enrolled in a post-secondary computer science program. Their narratives provided meaning into the social and cultural environments that contribute to their persistence in their technical studies, as well as identifying barriers and challenges that are faced by female students who choose to study computer science. It is hoped that the data collected from this study may provide recommendations for the recruiting, retention and support for women in computer science departments of U.S. colleges and universities, and thereby increase the numbers of women computer scientists in industry.

Responding to the needs of linguistically different students: Informing the Rio Grande Valley principalship of effective teaching practices;The purpose of this study was to inform the principalship of how teachers’ lived experiences contribute to the academic development of linguistically different students currently enrolled in a Rio Grande Valley secondary school. This study was intended to offer insight into the challenges this student population faces and to understand the factors teachers believe improve academic achievement of the students they serve. The researcher conducted a qualitative study using a narrative inquiry to collect data. The narrative design allowed participants time to offer an account of their lived experiences when working with linguistically different students. Data collected for this narrative inquiry were used to gain a better understanding of educators’ experiences with linguistically different students whose primary language is Spanish and to provide the principalship instructional practices that teachers believed help this population. Results of this study can be used by the principalship to develop teaching strategies that help minimize the achievement gap that exists among student populations and enhance good teaching practices to improve the academic success of all student populations.;1830493737;Dissertations & Theses;;Gamboa, David A.;;;" Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.";; Dissertation/Thesis;; 2016; 978-1-369-17814-2;;; English; English;;;2016;ProQuest Dissertations and Theses;2016;;https://search.proquest.com/docview/1830493737?accountid=11774; 0441 English as a Second Language , 0449 Educational leadership; 0441 English as a Second Language , 0449 Educational leadership;; 0441 English as a Second Language , 0449 Educational leadership;;; 0441 English as a Second Language , 0449 Educational leadership; English as a Second Language , Educational leadership , Qualitative research , Academic achievement , Narratives , Elementary school students , Spanish , Teaching , Secondary schools , Language teaching methods , Teachers , Secondary school students , Rio Grande Valley; Education , Grande , Informing , Linguistically , Linguistically different , Principalship , Responding , Rio , Teaching , Valley;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:Education+Database&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Responding+to+the+needs+of+linguistically+different+students%3A+Informing+the+Rio+Grande+Valley+principalship+of+effective+teaching+practices&amp;issn=&amp;date=2016-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Gamboa%2C+David+A.&amp;isbn=978-1-369-17814-2&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/";ProQuest Central,Social Science Premium Collection
Social gamification in multimedia instruction: Assessing the effects of animation, reward strategies, and social interactions on learners motivation and academic performance in online settings;"Gamification is the strategy of using game elements and game-design mechanics in nongaming contexts. Many companies have gamified their online applications to increase customers’ motivation and engagement. Increased motivation is also a critical factor that influences learning performance in online settings; however, the question of how to retain newly gained motivation and transfer it into learning efforts is still a challenge in educational technology. This study investigated the ways that social interactions can be used to facilitate students’ self-regulated learning in online education. The fundamental hypothesis underlying this research is that an integrative model of social gamification and multimedia instruction will promote students’ self-discipline during the online learning process, which in turn assures a better learning performance within online education. This study has designed and developed a socially gamified animation to examine whether social gamification can increase the motivation and engagement of students and to facilitate students’ learning of polar science knowledge in an online learning environment. This study employed a between-subject design as an experimental design method to investigate the effect of the proposed socially gamified animation. In general, findings indicated that social gamification could improve students’ content knowledge. In addition, students’ increased cognitive engagement during the learning process has a positive impact on their learning performance. Discriminant analyses, however, did not support significant differences in cognitive engagement between students who learned with socially gamified animations and those students who did not. It is unclear whether the implementation of social gamification could promote higher level of motivation and cognitive engagement and whether this motivation and cognitive engagement subsequently results in advanced learning performance in online settings. These findings have implications for understanding the motivational and instructional effect of social gamification in online learning. In addition, the design and development of the socially gamified animation investigated in this study provides an example of bridging the theory-practice gap in gamification of online education.";1830464088;Dissertations & Theses;;Hsu, Kuang-Chen;;;" Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.";; Dissertation/Thesis;; 2016; 978-1-369-17837-1;;; English; English;;;2016;ProQuest Dissertations and Theses;2016;;https://search.proquest.com/docview/1830464088?accountid=11774; 0447 Instructional Design , 0633 Cognitive psychology , 0710 Educational technology; 0447 Instructional Design , 0633 Cognitive psychology , 0710 Educational technology;; 0447 Instructional Design , 0633 Cognitive psychology , 0710 Educational technology;;; 0447 Instructional Design , 0633 Cognitive psychology , 0710 Educational technology; Instructional Design , Cognitive psychology , Educational technology; Psychology , Education , Elearning , Gamification , Instructional design , Motivation , Multimedia instruction , Science education;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:Psychology+Database&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Social+gamification+in+multimedia+instruction%3A+Assessing+the+effects+of+animation%2C+reward+strategies%2C+and+social+interactions+on+learners+motivation+and+academic+performance+in+online+settings&amp;issn=&amp;date=2016-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Hsu%2C+Kuang-Chen&amp;isbn=978-1-369-17837-1&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/";ProQuest Central,Social Science Premium Collection
Soft Skills Development of Engineering Students through Mentoring in Cooperative Education;Despite extensive research on soft skills development and mentoring in cooperative education, no identifiable study provides assessed the effectiveness of mentorship on developing soft skills, especially in engineering cooperative education. This study examines: (a) the difference between formally assigned mentors (supervisors) and informal, unassigned mentors (non-supervisors) in mentoring their students in developing soft skills and (b) which mentoring function—psychosocial or career— better helps students improve soft skills during their cooperative education program. Methodologically, this study used a longitudinal survey distributed both before and after the cooperative education program. From Summer 2014 through Fall 2014, eight universities with engineering cooperative education programs agreed to participate in the study with a total of 11 cooperative education cycles (three universities participated both in summer and fall cycles). Study participants were engineering students as they participated in their cooperative education programs. This research examined the participants’ experiences during the cooperative education program as well as participants' soft skills performance development. The study identified the significant factors that affect mentorship experiences associated with engineering cooperative education. The study included a survey developed based on Noe’s mentoring function scale (Noe, 1988) and Kantrowitz’s Soft Skills Performance Measurement (SSPM) (Kantrowitz, 2005). The results were used to build a predictive model for testing the two hypotheses in the engineering education program setting: (a) Students who have informal, unassigned mentors (non-supervisors) are more likely to improve soft skills compared to those who have formally assigned mentors (supervisors), and (b) Psychosocial mentoring functions improves soft skills performance more effectively than career mentoring functions. Results indicate that there is no significant difference between informal, unassigned mentors (non-supervisors) and formally assigned mentors (supervisors), and psychosocial mentoring is a better mentoring function to help engineering students in developing their soft skills during a cooperative education program.;1828879424;Dissertations & Theses;;Hening, Dyah A.;;;" Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.";; Dissertation/Thesis;; 2016; 978-1-369-00582-0;;; English; English;;;2016;ProQuest Dissertations and Theses;2016;;https://search.proquest.com/docview/1828879424?accountid=11774; 0537 Engineering , 0745 Higher education; 0537 Engineering , 0745 Higher education;; 0537 Engineering , 0745 Higher education;;; 0537 Engineering , 0745 Higher education; Engineering , Higher education; Applied sciences , Education , Communication skills , Engineering cooperative education , Hierarchical regression , Leadership skills , Mentoring , Soft skills;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:Education+Database&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Soft+Skills+Development+of+Engineering+Students+through+Mentoring+in+Cooperative+Education&amp;issn=&amp;date=2016-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Hening%2C+Dyah+A.&amp;isbn=978-1-369-00582-0&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/";ProQuest Central,SciTech Premium Collection,Social Science Premium Collection
Prospective Science Teachers' Field Experiences in K-12 STEM Academy Classrooms: Opportunities to Learn High-Leverage Science Teaching Practices;"Science education reform efforts in the U.S. have emphasized shifting away from teacher-centered instruction and teaching science as isolated facts, to more student-centered instruction where students engage in disciplinary discourse and science and engineering practices to learn more connected concepts. As such, teachers need to be prepared to teach science in these reform-based ways; however, many teachers have neither experienced reform-based science instruction in their own science learning, nor witnessed reform-based science instruction in their preservice classroom field experiences. At the same time, there has been an emphasis in teacher education on organizing the preparation of new teachers around high-leverage teaching practices—equitable teaching practices that are known to result in student learning and form a strong base for future teacher learning. In this qualitative study, I investigated eight prospective secondary science teachers as they participated in the unique field experience contexts of classrooms in STEM-focused high school academies. Using a lens of situated learning theory, I examined how prospective teachers from two classroom-based field experiences engaged in high-leverage teaching practices and how their experiences in these classrooms shaped their own visions of science teaching. I analyzed video data of classroom instruction, along with prospective and mentor teacher interviews and surveys, to determine the instructional contexts of each academy and the science teaching strategies (including high-leverage practices) that prospective teachers had opportunities to observe and participate in. I also analyzed prospective teacher interviews and surveys to determine their visions of effective science teaching, what high-leverage science teaching practices prospective teachers included in their visions, and how their visions changed throughout the experience. I found that both academy contexts featured more student work, particularly group work, than teacher talk. Small group work was an important instructional context: Mentor and prospective teachers most often employed high-leverage science teaching practices as students engaged in small group work. Additionally, prospective teachers most frequently interacted with and helped students as students worked in groups or on individual tasks. Prospective teachers from both academies incorporated ideas aligned with high-leverage teaching practices into their visions of effective science of teaching. However, prospective teachers also maintained less sophisticated conceptions of science teaching in their visions.

Teaching employability skills to post-secondary students through e-learning: A case study of online curriculum;"Employability skills, also known as soft-skills and 21st century skills, are defined as a set of attributes, skills, and knowledge that all labor market participants should possess to ensure they have the capability to be effective in the workplace. Traditionally, employability skill development took place in the on-site classroom setting. With the widespread adoption of online learning there have been theoretical models for developing employability skills in the online environment yet the empirical research to support the theoretical models is insufficient. The purpose of this qualitative descriptive case study was to discover how curricular activities are being used in the online course-room to develop employability skills, which are highly necessary to tackle the challenges in the global economic market. Specifically, the manner in which employability skill development activities are being integrated into e-learning curriculum will be examined. This study included six veteran online instructors, who are employed within three colleges of study at a Nebraska post-secondary institution. Participants in this study provided their perceptions of current practices that promote the development of employability skills within the online environment. Common themes found include current institutional practices that support instructors to include employability skill development in e-learning, curriculum practices that support a student's development of employability skills in the e-learning environment, institutional procedures that promote faculty training in the deployment of employability skills, and barriers to incorporating employability skills into the online environment. Based upon the data analysis, leadership and institutional-wide practices are in place which support the integration of employability skills into the e-learning environment. Implementation of practices that support employability skill development are evident across multiple schools of study. Methods for professional development are in place and are focused on employability skill development practices for both faculty and students. Additionally, barriers to the integration of employability skill development were found at all hierarchical levels: leadership/institution-wide, faculty, and student. This study will help guide future research in the area of employability skill development within the online environment. Specifically, a close analysis of current practices across all hierarchical levels is needed; leadership/institution-wide, faculty, and student.";1811444140;Dissertations & Theses;;Olson, Jonathan D.;;;" Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.";; Dissertation/Thesis;; 2016; 978-1-339-92832-6;;; English; English;;;2016;ProQuest Dissertations and Theses;2016;;https://search.proquest.com/docview/1811444140?accountid=11774; 0447 Instructional Design , 0456 Pedagogy , 0710 Educational technology; 0447 Instructional Design , 0456 Pedagogy , 0710 Educational technology;; 0447 Instructional Design , 0456 Pedagogy , 0710 Educational technology;;; 0447 Instructional Design , 0456 Pedagogy , 0710 Educational technology; Instructional Design , Pedagogy , Educational technology; Education , 21st century skills , E-learning , Employability skills , Online learning , Post-secondary , Soft skills;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:Education+Database&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Teaching+employability+skills+to+post-secondary+students+through+e-learning%3A+A+case+study+of+online+curriculum&amp;issn=&amp;date=2016-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Olson%2C+Jonathan+D.&amp;isbn=978-1-339-92832-6&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/";ProQuest Central,Social Science Premium Collection
Implementing Agile Development At Scale : An Industry Case Study;"Agile software development methodologies are extremely popular. Their dynamic restructuring of the development process has been seen as the silver bullet for increasing the productivity of software development. A significant number of studies have analyzed the impact of implementing agile techniques. However these are mostly evaluated only in smaller team settings. There is very little reporting done on how agile development methods can be implemented at the team level and scaled up at the program/portfolio level in large software organizations. We present the results of an empirical study conducted at Pearson Education. The study focuses on the penetration of agile development in the organization, agile development practices followed at the team and program level and the perception of agile development by the people in diverse roles. The study shows that about 90% of the respondents use agile development. Of those working in agile development 13% work at the program level and 87% work at the team level. Similar to the practices at the team level, there are standard practices followed at the program level with varying rigor. Most view agile development favorably due to the benefits of agile development. Top benefits reported are improved communication between team members, quick releases and the increased flexibility to changes. Our analysis also indicates that among the population using the non-agile methods, 83% would like to switch to agile methods, while 11% of the agile users would like to switch to non-agile methods. Agile practices are followed more rigorously in larger teams. Respondents who only have experience working with agile methods practice agile techniques more rigorously and perceive it more positively. Respondents with training in agile methods are significantly more inclined to adhere to the process and have an overwhelmingly positive opinion about it. However, challenging conventional wisdom is the finding that experience does not impact the rigor or perception of agile methods. Dependencies among projects seem to have negative impact on the success at the program level due to the challenges in coordination. There is an increased need to focus on testing at the project level; however the rest of the aspects like estimation, prioritization, productivity and time tracking, reviews and continuous integration are working well at the project level. There can be an increased focus on some of the less rigorously used practices at the program level. As training seems to have a significant positive impact on the overall experience of agile development, it would help to increase the focus on training at an organizational level. In conclusion the data indicates that there is a way of successfully scaling up agile methods from the team/project level to the program level by following a disciplined approach. Teams and programs have dependencies, so better synchronization and coordination can be achieved if the agile methods are implemented across all the teams and programs. Training resources, defining and rigorously practicing agile techniques at the program and project level and reducing dependencies are key factors in the success of scaling agile methodologies.";1811433824;Dissertations & Theses;;Kataria, Nikita;;;" Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.";; Dissertation/Thesis;; 2016; 978-1-339-92809-8;;; English; English;;;2016;ProQuest Dissertations and Theses;2016;;https://search.proquest.com/docview/1811433824?accountid=11774; 0984 Computer science; 0984 Computer science;; 0984 Computer science;;; 0984 Computer science; Computer science; Applied sciences , Agile , Case study , Scaling , Software development;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:Matericals+Science+%26+Engineering+Dissertations&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Implementing+Agile+Development+At+Scale+%3A+An+Industry+Case+Study&amp;issn=&amp;date=2016-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Kataria%2C+Nikita&amp;isbn=978-1-339-92809-8&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/";SciTech Premium Collection
Higher Education Faculty Perceptions of the Infusion of Virtual Labs in IT Degree Programs: An Exploratory Multi-Case Study;Laboratory-based courses play an increasingly pivotal role in all aspects of engineering and information technology education. In online and web-enhanced learning environments, higher education faculty teaching technology-based courses must engage students to acquire real-world skills through virtual (simulation-based) hands-on labs. Virtual laboratory, also known as virtual labs, prepare students by allowing them to practice in authentic, simulated environments with the tools they will need in the workplace. For teaching technology-based degree courses, hands-on labs are tremendously important in the information technology (IT) curriculum. The specific problem is this: as faculty continue to feel pressure from students and educational systems to adopt new technologies, there are still questions guided by Rogers’ (2003) theory of DOI on how to best infuse virtual laboratories in online courses for IT curricula. The purpose of this qualitative case study was to explore the perceptions of undergraduate IT faculty on how, why, and at what rate virtual labs were infused in web-enhanced and online courses. A multiple-case research design was used and the data was collected through interviewing eight undergraduate IT faculty through online survey questionnaire from four-year degree granting institutions within the United States (U.S.). Data triangulation was used for validity by the use of multiple sources and a quality audit was done through subject matter expert (SME) examination and reflection on the data. Results indicate that faculty expressed a higher overall satisfaction with using virtual labs and strongly perceived simulation followed with hands-on onsite labs as the balanced approach in adding value for students’ learning. Implications for practice are shared and recommendations for future research are proposed in the conclusion.;1805170174;Dissertations & Theses;;Jagannathan, Usha;;;" Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.";; Dissertation/Thesis;; 2016; 978-1-339-80119-3;;; English; English;;;2016;ProQuest Dissertations and Theses;2016;;https://search.proquest.com/docview/1805170174?accountid=11774; 0489 Information Technology , 0745 Higher education; 0489 Information Technology , 0745 Higher education;; 0489 Information Technology , 0745 Higher education;;; 0489 Information Technology , 0745 Higher education; Information Technology , Higher education; Applied sciences , Education , E-learning , Hands-on labs , Online education , Virtual labs;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:Education+Database&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Higher+Education+Faculty+Perceptions+of+the+Infusion+of+Virtual+Labs+in+IT+Degree+Programs%3A+An+Exploratory+Multi-Case+Study&amp;issn=&amp;date=2016-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Jagannathan%2C+Usha&amp;isbn=978-1-339-80119-3&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/";ProQuest Central,Social Science Premium Collection
Unique and Diverse Voices of African American Women in Engineering at Predominately White Institutions: Unpacking Individual Experiences and Factors Shaping Degree Completion;In 2012, 1% of the African American women who enrolled in an undergraduate engineering program four years prior graduated, amounting to 862 African American women graduating with engineering degrees. This qualitative study, anchored in interpretive phenomenological methodology, utilized undergraduate socialization with an overarching critical race theory lens to examine the manner in which African American women in engineering, such as the 862, make meaning of their experiences at predominately White institutions. The findings of the study are important because they corroborated existing research findings and more importantly, the findings in this study emphasize the importance of faculty and institutional agent support, self-efficacy leading to motivation, academic achievement goals and the development of science identities. These factors were significant to the persistence of African American women in this study. Moreover, this study’s findings suggest that these factors must work in concert to be most effective. The findings demonstrated that students need to develop relationships with faculty, administrators and peers. The administrators provide access to resources that assist with persistence and peers are needed for group work and academic support. The faculty relation is most important because the faculty members provide access to information, research opportunities, grades and research and industry contacts. The research also found that the women carried the responsibility of developing and nurturing the relation with the faculty. Moreover, all of the African American women in the study acknowledge racism and sexism however, they responded to these deterrents differently. Some of the women were negatively affected while others chose to ignore the deterrents. However, with the presence of these obstacles, the study validated the notion that these African American women in engineering had a strong sense of self-efficacy which provided a foundation for the women to possess science identities: research scientist, altruistic or disruptive. With these identities, the African American women sought to engage their scientific knowledge further in graduate school, the workplace and altruistically to improve upon society. These findings produce implications for policy and practice, suggesting that engineering colleges commit to transforming academic environments to reflect an atmosphere that is inclusive and supportive of racial and gender differences. This transformation should encompass pedagogy, curriculum, composition of faculty and student populations as well as the academic culture, allowing for a more welcoming and supportive atmosphere, where African American women can persist without concern for proving themselves because of their race or gender.;1803940504;Dissertations & Theses;;LaMotte, Ellise M.

Playing for real: Designing alternate reality games in learning contexts;Alternate Reality Game (ARG) represent a new genre of transmedia practice where players hunt for scattered clues, make sense of disparate information, and solve puzzles to advance an ever-evolving storyline. Players participate in ARGs using multiple communications technologies, ranging from print materials to mobile devices. However, many interaction design challenges must be addressed to weave these everyday communication tools together into an immersive, participatory experience. Transmedia design is not an everyday process. Designers must create and connect story bits across multiple media (video, audio, text) and multiple platforms (phones, computers, physical spaces). Furthermore, they must engage with players of varying skill levels. Few studies to-date have explored the design process of ARGs in learning contexts. Fewer still have focused on challenges involved in designing for youth (13-17 years old). In this study, I explore the process of designing ARGs as vehicles for promoting information literacy and participatory culture for adolescents (13-17 years old). Two ARG design scenarios, distinguished by target learning environment (formal and informal context) and target audience (adolescents), comprise the two cases that I examine. Through my analysis of these two design cases, I articulate several unique challenges faced by designers who create interactive, transmedia stories for – and with – youth. Drawing from these design challenges, I derive a repertoire of design strategies that future designers and researchers may use to create and implement ARGs for teens in learning contexts. In particular, I propose a narrative design framework that allows for the categorization of ARGs as storytelling constructs that lie along a continuum of participation and interaction. The framework can serve as an analytic tool for researchers and a guide for designers. In addition, I establish a framework of social roles that designers may employ to craft transmedia narratives before live launch and to promote and scaffold player participation after play begins. Overall, the contributions of my study include theoretical insights that may advance our understanding of narrative design and analysis as well as more practical design implications for designers and practitioners seeking to incorporate transmedia features into learning experiences that target youth.;1799101119;Dissertations & Theses;;Bonsignore, Elizabeth Marie;;;" Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.";; Dissertation/Thesis;; 2016; 978-1-339-86711-3;;; English; English;;;2016;ProQuest Dissertations and Theses;2016;;https://search.proquest.com/docview/1799101119?accountid=11774; 0389 Design , 0515 Education , 0723 Information science; 0389 Design , 0515 Education , 0723 Information science;; 0389 Design , 0515 Education , 0723 Information science;;; 0389 Design , 0515 Education , 0723 Information science; Design , Education , Information science; Communication and the arts , Education , Adolescents , Alternate reality games , Human-computer interaction , Learning , Teenagers , Transmedia;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:Education+Database&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Playing+for+real%3A+Designing+alternate+reality+games+in+learning+contexts&amp;issn=&amp;date=2016-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Bonsignore%2C+Elizabeth+Marie&amp;isbn=978-1-339-86711-3&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/";ProQuest Central,Social Science Premium Collection
From Exceptional to Expelled: Exploring the Psychological Types of Exceptionally Bright but Academically 'At-Risk' University Learners;This research identifies characteristics of exceptionally bright but academically ‘at-risk’ university learners using Jung’s Theory of Psychological Type (1921). This theory is examined in relation to academic success rates in a southwestern Ontario university. This case study highlights students whose secondary school averages were above 85% when they entered university, but were required to withdraw from the university after their first year. Quantitative data including MBTI self-assessment results and end of term grades were collected from 420 students. Qualitative data were collected from nine semi-structured interviews with instructors and advisors who worked with these students. A mixed methods approach and transformative research design inform the data collection and analysis process. Quantitative results highlight patterns in student characteristics based on Jung’s Theory of Psychological Type. Qualitative results identified student learning approaches and the administration of the retention program as barriers to students’ academic success. Finally, binary logistic regressions identified direct correlations between students’ Strategies and Skills for Academic Success course grades, their Psychological Types (as noted by the MBTI self-assessment tool) and their persistence to continue in university studies. Practical implications from this study add another analytical dimension to the conversation between the advisor and their ‘at-risk’ student who is considering retention programming. Jung’s Theory of Psychological Type is incorporated into a screening process that advisors can use. Finally, a theoretical model suggests the dynamic interplay between how students learn, how they process information and make decisions and the need to be cognizant of the environmental, personal and behavioural factors when designing interventions that are in-line with students’ Psychological Types.;1796990235;Dissertations & Theses;;Prier, Andrea;;;" Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.";; Dissertation/Thesis;; 2016; 978-1-339-83978-3;;; English; English;;;2016;ProQuest Dissertations and Theses;2016;;https://search.proquest.com/docview/1796990235?accountid=11774; 0288 Educational tests & measurements , 0515 Education , 0516 Adult education; 0288 Educational tests & measurements , 0515 Education , 0516 Adult education;; 0288 Educational tests & measurements , 0515 Education , 0516 Adult education;;; 0288 Educational tests & measurements , 0515 Education , 0516 Adult education; Educational tests & measurements , Education , Adult education; Education , Advisors , At-risk students , Exceptionally bright , Mbti , Metacognition , Psychological type;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:Education+Database&amp;atitle=&amp;title=From+Exceptional+to+Expelled%3A+Exploring+the+Psychological+Types+of+Exceptionally+Bright+but+Academically+%27At-Risk%27+University+Learners&amp;issn=&amp;date=2016-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Prier%2C+Andrea&amp;isbn=978-1-339-83978-3&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/";ProQuest Central,Social Science Premium Collection
Science, Technology, Engineering, Math (STEM) in Higher Education from the Perspective of Female Students: An Institutional Ethnography;"A persistent disadvantage for females is systemically embedded in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math (STEM) education in postsecondary institutions. As a result, undergraduate women majoring in STEM fields face a uniquely difficult path; yet, for the most part, recommendations made and supported in the literature have focused on recruitment of women to STEM fields or on ways to make women more successful and comfortable in their STEM major. These recommendations have so far proved to be insufficient to remedy a gender gap and serve to replicate the existing male hierarchy. In order to truly make the STEM classroom one in which women are welcome and comfortable and to challenge the existing social and scientific systems, it is necessary to explore and understand the social and political implications embedded within teaching and learning choices. This institutional ethnography addresses that gap. The purpose of this study was to uncover and describe the institutional practices of STEM education at a Midwest research university (MRU) from the standpoint of female undergraduate students. Using the framework of feminist standpoint theory, this study explored the everyday “work” of female undergraduate STEM students to provide a unique perspective on the STEM education teaching and learning environment. Data collection began with in-depth interviews with female undergraduate math and physics students. As the institutional processes shaping undergraduate participant experiences were identified, subsequent data collection included classroom observations, additional interviews with students and faculty, and analysis of the texts that mediate these processes (e.g., syllabi and student handbooks). Data analysis followed Carspecken’s process of ethnographic data analysis that began with low-level coding, followed by high-level coding, and concluded by pulling codes together through the creation of themes. Analysis of data led to three key findings. First, undergraduate participants reported being challenged by difficult and intimidating aspects of the teaching and learning environment. Second, undergraduate participants reported challenges meeting some of the characteristics of successful math and physics students (e.g., taking risks, asking questions, putting school first) and preferred a collectivistic environment. Third, participants described challenges from conflicting STEM academic expectations and institutional policies, which made it harder for them to meet STEM expectations. Findings indicate that efforts to reduce the “chilly” climate have been unsuccessful, largely because discourses that motivate the chilly climate have not changed. Those discourses are evidence of a masculine STEM institution, which also creates a male ideal that female students are expected to meet, further exacerbating their discomfort in the STEM environment. The masculinized nature of a STEM institution is reinforced by neoliberal policies that emphasize the importance of meeting gendered ideal STEM student characteristics. The result is that while women persist, they face stress, anxiety, and discomfort. Recommendations to improve the chilly climate include: revising the STEM institution from one that is masculine to one that is inclusive of women; and, to create a STEM educational environment that supports, validates, and gives women an equal voice.";1796968903;Dissertations & Theses;;Parson, Laura J.;;;" Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.";; Dissertation/Thesis;; 2016; 978-1-339-83631-7;;; English; English;;;2016;ProQuest Dissertations and Theses;2016;;https://search.proquest.com/docview/1796968903?accountid=11774; 0280 Mathematics education , 0714 Science education , 0745 Higher education; 0280 Mathematics education , 0714 Science education , 0745 Higher education;; 0280 Mathematics education , 0714 Science education , 0745 Higher education;;; 0280 Mathematics education , 0714 Science education , 0745 Higher education; Mathematics education , Science education , Higher education; Education , Feminist standpoint theory , Higher education , Institutional ethnography , Stem education;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:Education+Database&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Science%2C+Technology%2C+Engineering%2C+Math+%28STEM%29+in+Higher+Education+from+the+Perspective+of+Female+Students%3A+An+Institutional+Ethnography&amp;issn=&amp;date=2016-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Parson%2C+Laura+J.&amp;isbn=978-1-339-83631-7&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/";ProQuest Central,Social Science Premium Collection
Culturally responsive computing for American Indian youth: Making activities with electronic textiles in the native studies classroom;By providing access to hands-on activities and the physical and digital tools necessary to complete them, maker activities encourage cross-disciplinary, interest-driven learning and problem solving in schools. However, maker movement efforts to broaden participation into computer science have largely ignored Indigenous populations. In this dissertation, I examine how electronic textiles (e-textiles) materials connects to the heritage craft practices found in many Indigenous communities. By design, e-textiles materials combine low-tech craft practices like sewing with high-tech engineering and programming. Framing learning computing within these two distinct but overlapping cultural contexts provides youth will a familiar context in which to learn something new (programming), promotes positive identity development, and fosters connections across multiple dimensions of youth’s lives. At the core of this work is design-based research into the development and implementation of a three-week electronic textiles unit in gender-segregated Native Studies class with American Indian youth (12-14 years old) at a charter school located on tribal lands in the Southwest. This unit was implemented four times over the course of the school year. Findings highlight how different groups of students (American Indian girls and American Indian boys) engaged with e-textiles activities and how their perspectives on computing developed through participation in the unit. In addition, the teacher’s perspective on integrating digital technologies in the Native Studies classroom is explored within the context of contemporary Federal Indian educational policy and practice. This work makes three significant contributions to ethnography, computing education, and American Indian education. First, it proposes a new methodology through the integration of ethnography with design-based research and critical Indigenous research approaches. Second, it contributes to the emerging field of culturally responsive computing by exploring what happens when computing moves beyond the screen and into the tangible realm. Third, it furthers our understandings of the role of digital technologies in American Indian education, with a particular focus on how making activities might contribute to increased educational sovereignty for Indigenous peoples throughout the United States.;1796359054;Dissertations & Theses;;Searle, Kristin A.;;;" Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.";; Dissertation/Thesis;; 2016; 978-1-339-82733-9;;; English; English;;;2016;ProQuest Dissertations and Theses;2016;;https://search.proquest.com/docview/1796359054?accountid=11774; 0455 Multicultural Education , 0740 Native American studies , 0984 Computer science; 0455 Multicultural Education , 0740 Native American studies , 0984 Computer science;; 0455 Multicultural Education , 0740 Native American studies , 0984 Computer science;;; 0455 Multicultural Education , 0740 Native American studies , 0984 Computer science; Multicultural Education , Native American studies , Computer science; Social sciences , Applied sciences , Education , American indian , Electronic textiles , Making;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:Matericals+Science+%26+Engineering+Dissertations&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Culturally+responsive+computing+for+American+Indian+youth%3A+Making+activities+with+electronic+textiles+in+the+native+studies+classroom&amp;issn=&amp;date=2016-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Searle%2C+Kristin+A.&amp;isbn=978-1-339-82733-9&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/";SciTech Premium Collection
Making In Education: A Study Of Teachers Decisions To Participate In Professional Development, Their Emerging Understandings Of Making, And Teacher Plans For Implementation;"There is great hope that the implementation of the maker-based education within school-based learning will help bridge the ever-growing gap between formal classroom knowledge and real world problem solving. However, there is little known about the ways in which teachers perceive making in education, as well as what their essential needs are with respect to implementation of maker programming and overall professional development in maker education. Through a qualitative grounded theory research design, this dissertation examines the experiences of K-12 Northern California educators as they engaged in a professional development opportunity in maker education, and subsequently their intention to implement maker-based practices at their school sites. As part of the main research question for this study, there was a focus on discovering the perceived reasons K-12 teachers chose to participate in a maker certificate program. The purpose for this focus was to highlight similarities and inconsistencies behind the motivations, needs, and plans of maker educators. Participant responses centered around three main categories: (A.1) Maker Educator Network; (A.2) Student Engagement in Making; and (A.3) Innate Maker Philosophy. Several subcategories emerged consistently as secondary themes though the analysis of the interviews. Findings highlight the unique role that teachers play as stewards of maker education. Participants in this study expressed a need for leadership training in maker education as they exhibited an entrepreneurial commitment and passion for maker education and advocacy at their school sites and beyond. As the key informants in this investigation, participants revealed important insights into the ways in which professional development opportunities in maker education can support implementation of making in formal education.";1796041252;Dissertations & Theses;;Somerville, Rachel E.;;;" Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.";; Dissertation/Thesis;; 2016; 978-1-339-82484-0;;; English; English;;;2016;ProQuest Dissertations and Theses;2016;;https://search.proquest.com/docview/1796041252?accountid=11774; 0449 Educational leadership , 0530 Teacher education , 0727 Curriculum development; 0449 Educational leadership , 0530 Teacher education , 0727 Curriculum development;; 0449 Educational leadership , 0530 Teacher education , 0727 Curriculum development;;; 0449 Educational leadership , 0530 Teacher education , 0727 Curriculum development; Educational leadership , Teacher education , Curriculum development; Education , Constructionism , Innovation , Maker education , Maker educators , Maker professional development , Steam;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:Education+Database&amp;atitle=Association+Between+Lumbar+Disc+Degeneration+and+Propionibacterium+acnes+Infection%3A+Clinical+Research+and+Preliminary+Exploration+of+Animal+Experiment.&amp;title=Spine&amp;issn=1528-1159&amp;date=2016-07-01&amp;volume=41&amp;issue=13&amp;spage=E764&amp;au=Li%2C+Bo%3BDong%2C+Zhe%3BWu%2C+Yongchao%3BZeng%2C+Ji%3BZheng%2C+Qixin%3BXiao%2C+Baojun%3BCai%2C+Xianyi%3BXiao%2C+Zhiyong&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=Spine&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/26656049&amp;rft_id=info:doi/10.1097%2FBRS.0000000000001383";ProQuest Central,Social Science Premium Collection
Videogames, Informal Teaching, and the Rhetoric of Design;This dissertation is about videogames. It is also about teaching, and the ways videogame design represents good teaching. However, this dissertation is not about videogames alone. It makes broad claims about teaching in- and out-of-schools in the 21 st Century. Over the last few decades many scholars have been impressed by the rich forms of learning going on out-of-school. In particular, the emergence of digital and social media has fueled interest in informal learning while often ignoring or effacing the critical role of teaching. Indeed, the term informal learning is common while the term “informal teaching” barely exists. At the same time, the learning sciences have made progress on understanding how learning works based on empirical evidence of how the mind operates. While this research is not well implemented in many of our schools, it is well represented in much out-of-school learning (such as in videogames). This dissertation argues that there is a body of evidence germane to good teaching, that many learning principles celebrated today in out-of-school learning are actually teaching principles, and that good videogames can give us insights into how teaching can work as a form of design with or without games. The dissertation then develops a model of distributed teaching and learning systems which involve designed- and emergent organization of various teaching and learning “sites”. Finally, the dissertation looks at the rhetorical function of teaching in building a “deliberate learner”, one whose goal is not simply to know and do things, but to become a certain type of person committed to new ways with words, forms of interaction, and values. Rhetoric, teaching, learning, and design of all sorts have been set free from institutions and turned loose into a market place of ideas and sites. In the face of this market place we need to engage in discussions about who we want to be, who we want others to be, and what world we want all of us to live in. These discussions will center not just on “truth”, but on values as well—which is exactly where, in a high-risk imperiled world, they should be centered.;1793941013;Dissertations & Theses;;Holmes, Jeffrey Brandon;;;" Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.";; Dissertation/Thesis;; 2016; 978-1-339-72334-1;;; English; English;;;2016;ProQuest Dissertations and Theses;2016;;https://search.proquest.com/docview/1793941013?accountid=11774; 0681 Rhetoric , 0710 Educational technology , 0998 Education philosophy; 0681 Rhetoric , 0710 Educational technology , 0998 Education philosophy;; 0681 Rhetoric , 0710 Educational technology , 0998 Education philosophy;;; 0681 Rhetoric , 0710 Educational technology , 0998 Education philosophy; Rhetoric , Educational technology , Education philosophy; Language, literature and linguistics , Education , Design , Informal learning , Rhetoric , Teaching , Technology , Video games;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:Education+Database&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Videogames%2C+Informal+Teaching%2C+and+the+Rhetoric+of+Design&amp;issn=&amp;date=2016-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Holmes%2C+Jeffrey+Brandon&amp;isbn=978-1-339-72334-1&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/";ProQuest Central,Social Science Premium Collection
Exploring teachers' practices to develop students' self-regulated learning in U.S. K-12 online schools;Students’ ability to be engaged in self-regulated learning (SRL) has become more important in the emerging information age paradigm of education where learners have more control over their learning process. With growing interest in and popularity of online learning and lifelong learners, SRL is becoming more and more important for learners’ successful learning experience. In addition, online learning in K-12 is the area that is becoming more popular followed by higher education and corporate. Although SRL has known to be a teachable skill, little research has been done on how teachers develop their students’ SRL in online learning environments, and especially online K-12 school contexts. This dissertation aimed at 1) examining how teachers at online K-12 schools in the U.S. perceive the importance of SRL for their students and the importance of teachers’ teaching SRL skills to their online students, 2) examining how frequently teachers are providing supports for their students to develop SRL skills, 3) identifying what types of supports teachers are providing for their students to develop SRL skills, 4) examining how technology is being utilized to support teachers’ practices of developing students’ SRL, and 5) identifying whether teachers need to see more functions from technology in supporting their practices of developing SRL skills of their students. Survey responses of 112 teachers who were teaching at K-12 online schools in the U.S. revealed that they perceived that it was important for their online students to have self-regulated learning skills to be successful in their online learning experience. Moreover, they also perceived that it was very important for the teachers to teach their students SRL skills at K-12 online schools. In general, the teachers indicated they were frequently providing some supports for their students to develop SRL skills through their practices. Follow-up interviews and content analysis results showed the types of supports provided by teachers or institutions for students to develop SRL skills such as direct guidance, prompting, institutional support, and so on. Although there was little direct instruction support, teachers utilized various supports to develop their students’ SRL skills, and implications such as personalization, creating a learning community, and maintaining a balance between teacher-regulated learning and SRL were derived.;1786952500;Dissertations & Theses;;Huh, Yeol;;;" Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.";; Dissertation/Thesis;; 2016; 978-1-339-66873-4;;; English; English;;;2016;ProQuest Dissertations and Theses;2016;;https://search.proquest.com/docview/1786952500?accountid=11774; 0525 Educational psychology , 0710 Educational technology; 0525 Educational psychology , 0710 Educational technology;; 0525 Educational psychology , 0710 Educational technology;;; 0525 Educational psychology , 0710 Educational technology; Educational psychology , Educational technology; Education , Learning technologies , Online k-12 , Self-regulated learning , Teacher support;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:Education+Database&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Exploring+teachers%27+practices+to+develop+students%27+self-regulated+learning+in+U.S.+K-12+online+schools&amp;issn=&amp;date=2016-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Huh%2C+Yeol&amp;isbn=978-1-339-66873-4&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/";ProQuest Central,Social Science Premium Collection
An Analysis of In-house and Offshore-outsourced Software Development Projects Utilizing Waterfall versus Agile Methodologies: A Simulation Study;Software is an integral part of each and every business model, whether it is banking, manufacturing, insurance, hospitality, aviation, education, healthcare, social networking or any other domain. The design and development of any software system can require significant investments in capital, time, domain expertise, tools and infrastructure. Despite improvements in the software industry over the past decades, the percentage of software failures has also increased, which led to loss of capital, time and information. Software development projects continue to fail due to the use of ineffective development and management processes, commonly found in waterfall-like development, that inject faults into various stages of the software development life cycle. Repeated use of a development process that does not produce software that performs as intended can impose serious problems on a software development project. Hence, it is essential that organizations employ a consistent and adaptable process that allows for the creation and delivery of quality software that satisfies customer’s expectations. Such a process offers a framework that could help to plan new projects, avoid repeating the mistakes of past projects, and improve on successful elements. Traditional, sequential development methodologies such as waterfall differ from later adaptive and iterative methods like agile. Many of the practices of traditional methods are not effective in software development projects created today. However, because of their failure to accept this reality, many organizations continue to use software development processes that do not produce desired results. Still, today popular belief is that offshore development is the ‘fix’ for in-house or onshore project problems. This dissertation analyzes in-house and offshore- outsourced software projects utilizing waterfall versus agile development to identify the real determinants of the problems. It concludes with an agile simulation of the problems to show the difference had the projects been done in an agile manner. The study will provide useful insights that can be adopted to institute an effective software development process that produces successful, high quality software that can be used.;1781242041;Dissertations & Theses;;Maxwell-Sinclair, Novelle;;;" Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.";; Dissertation/Thesis;; 2016; 978-1-339-61995-8;;; English; English;;;2016;ProQuest Dissertations and Theses;2016;;https://search.proquest.com/docview/1781242041?accountid=11774; 0489 Information Technology , 0984 Computer science; 0489 Information Technology , 0984 Computer science;; 0489 Information Technology , 0984 Computer science;;; 0489 Information Technology , 0984 Computer science; Information Technology , Computer science; Applied sciences , Agile , In-house , Offshoring , Software development , Software quality , Waterfall;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:Matericals+Science+%26+Engineering+Dissertations&amp;atitle=&amp;title=An+Analysis+of+In-house+and+Offshore-outsourced+Software+Development+Projects+Utilizing+Waterfall+versus+Agile+Methodologies%3A+A+Simulation+Study&amp;issn=&amp;date=2016-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Maxwell-Sinclair%2C+Novelle&amp;isbn=978-1-339-61995-8&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/";SciTech Premium Collection
A Study of the Success of Group Formation in Virtual Teams Using Computer-Mediated Communications;In the digital domain, virtual teams within organizations and corporations are becoming common. Restructuring an organization or corporation is vital because competition and globalization are increasing. In this era of globalization, distributed working groups need to develop a competitive advantage in these ever-changing environments. Historically, teams had experienced problems stemming from geographical and temporal limitations. With the increase of technology in telecommunications, organizations are increasingly forming virtual teams, which have become critical to the survival of nearly any corporate entity. Virtual teams have some of the same problems that regular teams have. One of the key challenges is the method of forming teams, while such challenge is exacerbated in digital environments. Despite the difficulties, the digital environment has made successful team development all the more challenging. The variation in people's skills makes the formation of teams even more difficult. This is why organizations cannot determine in advance if a virtual team will be a success. To evaluate the success of team formation in a virtual setting, this research study assessed the role of different computer-mediated communications (CMC) levels employed (no-CMC/face-to-face, online learning system, online learning system + social networking site) on the success of team formation measured by the level of task performance (TP), team cohesiveness (TC), computer skills (CS) and social bond (SB), while assessing the differences on such relationships when controlled for demographic information such as gender, age, education level, academic major, as well as academic year. Empirical data was collected from students at the Medical Sciences Campus in the University of Puerto Rico with 140 usable records. Using three teams and 140 participants, the results indicated that there is a statistically significance difference in the role of CMC levels employed (no-CMC/face-to-face, online learning system, online learning system + social networking site) on the level of perception of CS in team formation. Significant differences were also found in the role of CMC levels employed on the levels of TP, when controlled for gender. In addition, there is a significance difference in the role of CMC levels employed (no-CMC/face-to-face, online learning system, online learning system + social networking site) on the levels of CS, when controlled for education, academic major and academic year. The outcomes of the study contributed to the body of knowledge for both practice and research, to help organizations identify ways to support effective team formations in virtual environments.;1780296412;Dissertations & Theses;;Melon-Melon, Eliel;;;" Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.";; Dissertation/Thesis;; 2016; 978-1-339-59724-9;;; English; English;;;2016;ProQuest Dissertations and Theses;2016;;https://search.proquest.com/docview/1780296412?accountid=11774; 0464 Computer Engineering , 0489 Information Technology , 0984 Computer science; 0464 Computer Engineering , 0489 Information Technology , 0984 Computer science;; 0464 Computer Engineering , 0489 Information Technology , 0984 Computer science;;; 0464 Computer Engineering , 0489 Information Technology , 0984 Computer science; Computer Engineering , Information Technology , Computer science; Applied sciences , Computer-mediated communications in teams , Social networking sites in teams , Task performance , Team cohesion , Team formation , Virtual teams;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:Matericals+Science+%26+Engineering+Dissertations&amp;atitle=&amp;title=A+Study+of+the+Success+of+Group+Formation+in+Virtual+Teams+Using+Computer-Mediated+Communications&amp;issn=&amp;date=2016-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Melon-Melon%2C+Eliel&amp;isbn=978-1-339-59724-9&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/";SciTech Premium Collection
An Analysis of Game-Based Learning for the Design of Digital Science Games;As science becomes increasingly data-driven, there is a need to prepare the next generation of youth with the wide variety of skills and tools necessary for future scientific careers. In this dissertation, I address the diverse gameplay capabilities present in youth, arguing that educators and designers can and should leverage these in the design of educational science games. I employ both quantitative and qualitative approaches to examine gameplay within the context of the bioinformatics game, MAX5. Two initial studies are presented showing that a player’s previous experience with a game’s genre and the types of messages shared between players during social gameplay are significant predictors for learning outcomes. A qualitative data analysis then identifies themes of gameplay that are compared and contrasted with existing theories to lay the building blocks for a new complex systems model of game-based learning. Components of this model exist within five interlinked layers: the input, the sensory sphere, the structural dynamics, semiotic translation, and memory-action patterns, all existing within a larger dynamic network of games and players. These research findings provide a means for game designers to broaden the participation of youth in the sciences by matching player capabilities with appropriate game elements and learning content. This research further highlights the need for more adaptive science games that reflect not only players’ varied capabilities, but also the increasingly multidisciplinary and collaborative nature of scientific practice.;1778496974;Dissertations & Theses;;Perry, Daniel;;;" Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.";; Dissertation/Thesis;; 2016; 978-1-339-58750-9;;; English; English;;;2016;ProQuest Dissertations and Theses;2016;;https://search.proquest.com/docview/1778496974?accountid=11774; 0489 Information Technology , 0710 Educational technology , 0715 Bioinformatics; 0489 Information Technology , 0710 Educational technology , 0715 Bioinformatics;; 0489 Information Technology , 0710 Educational technology , 0715 Bioinformatics;;; 0489 Information Technology , 0710 Educational technology , 0715 Bioinformatics; Information Technology , Educational technology , Bioinformatics; Biological sciences , Applied sciences , Education , Game-based learning , Human-computer interaction , Science education , Video games;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:Education+Database&amp;atitle=&amp;title=An+Analysis+of+Game-Based+Learning+for+the+Design+of+Digital+Science+Games&amp;issn=&amp;date=2016-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Perry%2C+Daniel&amp;isbn=978-1-339-58750-9&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/";ProQuest Central,SciTech Premium Collection,Social Science Premium Collection
Student Perceptions of Flipped Learning in a High School Math Classroom;Flipped classrooms are implemented in more schools each year, particularly in courses requiring increased teacher guidance for mastery. While a foundation of research related to pedagogy and academic outcomes exists, research is limited surrounding student perceptions of the social and learning culture during flipped learning. The purpose of this study was to explore high school math students’ lived experiences of flipped learning related to content and instruction, critical thinking, and collaboration and interactions. A phenomenological design was employed using a conceptual framework combining cognitive load theory, sociocultural learning theory, and schema theory. Students from two public high schools in the Midwest participated. Seven students participated in interviews, and nine students participated in two focus group discussions. Data analysis involved in vivo coding of transcribed interviews and focus groups. Key results included students’ perceptions of increased engagement and interactions, as well as more in-depth learning in flipped environments. Increased critical thinking was related to both instructional strategies employed and students’ ability to self-regulate learning. Concepts of peer collaboration shifted as students viewed learning environments and sources of expertise as more extensive in the flipped environment. This study contributes to positive social change by providing educators and researchers with a deeper understanding of the importance of ensuring students are competent in using social technology tools that encourage students to interact both socially and academically in order to help them become more self-directed learners.;1776469846;Dissertations & Theses;;Strohmyer, Daniel A.;;;" Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.";; Dissertation/Thesis;; 2016; 978-1-339-56443-2;;; English; English;;;2016;ProQuest Dissertations and Theses;2016;;https://search.proquest.com/docview/1776469846?accountid=11774; 0525 Educational psychology , 0530 Teacher education , 0710 Educational technology; 0525 Educational psychology , 0530 Teacher education , 0710 Educational technology;; 0525 Educational psychology , 0530 Teacher education , 0710 Educational technology;;; 0525 Educational psychology , 0530 Teacher education , 0710 Educational technology; Educational psychology , Teacher education , Educational technology; Education , Critical thinking , Flipped classroom , Flipped learning , Flipped teaching , Inverted teaching , Mathematics;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:Education+Database&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Student+Perceptions+of+Flipped+Learning+in+a+High+School+Math+Classroom&amp;issn=&amp;date=2016-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Strohmyer%2C+Daniel+A.&amp;isbn=978-1-339-56443-2&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/";ProQuest Central,Social Science Premium Collection
Exploring the Flipped Classroom in a Community College Setting;"The purpose of this study was to explore the flipped classroom approach in a community college setting and assess its impact on students’ learning experience and performance. Participants in this study were second semester computer programming students (n = 103) at a mid-sized community college of applied arts and technology. This study used a convergent parallel mixed method design to compare three different teaching methodologies: a flipped classroom approach, an active/collaborative approach, and a conventional lecture/assignment approach. Garrison’s (2012) Community of Inquiry framework was used to assess the student learning experience afforded by each approach. The flipped classroom approach was rated significantly higher than the lecture/assignment approach in terms of the overall learning experience ( p &lt; .05, d = 0.39) and social presence ( p &lt; .05, d = 0.53). The active/collaborative approach was rated significantly higher than the lecture/assignment approach for the overall learning experience ( p &lt; .05, d = 0.54), overall attitudes and preferences ( p &lt; .05, d = 0.49), teaching presence ( p &lt; .05, d = 0.43), and social presence ( p &lt; .05, d = 0.71). There was no significant difference in student performance with regard to content knowledge among the three approaches.";1765205006;Dissertations & Theses;;MacDonald, William-Thomas F.;;;" Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.";; Dissertation/Thesis;; 2016; 978-1-339-44390-4;;; English; English;;;2016;ProQuest Dissertations and Theses;2016;;https://search.proquest.com/docview/1765205006?accountid=11774; 0275 Community college education , 0456 Pedagogy , 0710 Educational technology; 0275 Community college education , 0456 Pedagogy , 0710 Educational technology;; 0275 Community college education , 0456 Pedagogy , 0710 Educational technology;;; 0275 Community college education , 0456 Pedagogy , 0710 Educational technology; Community college education , Pedagogy , Educational technology; Education , Blended learning , Community college , Flipped classroom , Inverted teaching , Postsecondary education;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:Education+Database&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Exploring+the+Flipped+Classroom+in+a+Community+College+Setting&amp;issn=&amp;date=2016-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=MacDonald%2C+William-Thomas+F.&amp;isbn=978-1-339-44390-4&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/";ProQuest Central,Social Science Premium Collection
An academic home for play: games as unifying influences in higher education;"  Purpose - This paper aims to address opportunities and tensions when creating game-based learning practices in higher education. By detailing examples from a university in the Southeastern USA and the communities it serves, we suggest game-based research and learning be approached as a unifying influence adaptable across contexts. Design/methodology/approach - We use a working example methodology where someone with expertise ""works through"" a well-known issue while making the thinking overt. In this manner, we reveal processes, successes and challenges infusing game-based learning in higher education to deepen understanding between fields and encourage research and practice with games across disciplines. Findings - The working example demonstrates that games served as a unifying influence in three primary ways, which included redesigning courses and implementing programmatic changes; using existing programs to promote interdisciplinary teaching and research; and increasing outreach and partnerships. In each example, games served to strengthen or support the initiatives. Originality/value - This paper extends literature on the value of games to promote research and learning.

Curriculum development through understanding the student nurse experience of suicide intervention education - A phenomenographic study;Suicide remains a global public health issue and a major governmental concern. The World Health Organisation argues for continued investment in education for front-line professionals, with a particular focus on nurses, to address the rising suicide levels. Considering this rate, it could be argued that suicide has impacted on the lives of many, including the student nurse population. Understanding the psychological impact, and influence on learning, whilst developing suicide intervention knowledge is crucial. However, little is known of the student experience in this complex and challenging area of skills development. This phenomenographic study examines the experiences of second year Bachelor of Nursing (mental health) students who participated in the Applied Suicide Intervention Skills Training (ASIST). Experiences were illuminated through two focus groups, Experiences were distilled and categorised through hierarchically relationships to construct a group experiential field to illustrate understandings of the impact this approach has on learning Students found ASIST to be emotionally challenging yet an extremely positive experience through bonding, peer learning, and class cohesion. The supportive workshop facilitation was essential allowing for full immersion into role simulation thus developing student confidence. Appropriate pedagogy and student support must be considered whilst developing suicide intervention in the pre -registration curricula.;1762710145;Scholarly Journals;;"Heyman, Inga;Webster, Brian J;Tee, Stephen";;" World Health Organization

Acceptability and Satisfaction of an ICT-based Training for University Teachers;"E-learning can be defined as learning facilitated and supported through the use of ICTs. ICTs can increase students’ motivation, accelerate the knowledge process and facilitate the information access. The aim of this paper is to analyze the acceptability of three tools presented in a workshop carried out during six weeks, with university teachers (N = 22), taking into account their opinion about the usefulness of the workshop. Two researchers/teachers specializing in the field of educational technologies taught the three tools presented. Before the workshop, we administered a technology profile questionnaire; after it, we asked the teachers to fill in a questionnaire about the workshop and the tools used. We then carried out a non-parametric Friedman test to compare the differences found in the evaluation of the tools. The results show that the acceptability of the technologies and the methodology used during the workshop was high: teachers’ assessment and opinion has been favorable for both pedagogy and teaching methodology, which facilitated the understanding of the tools and the innovative nature of the contents of the workshop. The participants also evaluated the technologies as appropriate and easy to use.

From Hiscore to High Marks: Empirical Study of Teaching Programming Through Gamification;"  Unlike conventional taught learning, video games are very successful at keeping players constantly motivated and engaged on a set of tasks for many hours without apparent loss of focus. Additionally, when playing, gamers solve complex problems without experiencing the fatigue or frustration, which would normally accompany a comparable learning task. Any methods able to deliver deep learner engagement are naturally of interest to the academic community, thus resulting in an increasing interest in adopting gamification - the integration of gaming elements, mechanics, and frameworks into nongame situations and scenarios - as a means to drive student engagement and improve information retention. However, its application to education has been a challenging task, as attempts have generally been restricted to a one-dimensional approach, such as transposing a trivial reward system onto existing teaching material. The empirical evidence presented in this paper suggests that a gamified, multi-dimensional, problem-based learning approach may yield improved outcomes even when applied to a very complex and traditionally dry task like the teaching of computer programming. This quasiexperimental study employed a real time sequence of scored quizzes, instructor feedback, and live coding to deliver a fully interactive learning experience. By using a combination of the classroom version of the TV game show ""Who Wants To Be A Millionaire?"", the ""Kahoot!"" Classroom Response System (CRS), and Codecademy's online interactive platform on a Python programming course, students were allowed to experience multiple interlocking methods similar to what would be found in a top quality game experience. Empirical data on learning outcomes from the gamified group were compared with a control group that followed a traditional learning path, which had been used during previous cohorts. Whilst this was a relatively small study, the results were quite interesting in a number of key metrics, including attendance, downloading of course material, and final grades.";1728409757;Conference Papers & Proceedings;;"Fotaris, Panagiotis;Mastoras, Theodoros;Leinfellner, Richard;Rosunally, Yasmine";;; Copyright Academic Conferences International Limited Oct 2015;; Feature;; Oct 2015;;2049-0992;; English; English; 186-194; Reading;Oct 2015;European Conference on Games Based Learning;2015;;https://search.proquest.com/docview/1728409757?accountid=11774;;; Photographs , References , Tables , Graphs;;; 186;; Teaching , Education , Learning , Student participation , Studies , Motivation , Public speaking , Collaboration , Computer & video games , Laboratories , Gamification , Classrooms;;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Ahightechjournals&amp;atitle=From+Hiscore+to+High+Marks%3A+Empirical+Study+of+Teaching+Programming+Through+Gamification&amp;title=European+Conference+on+Games+Based+Learning&amp;issn=20490992&amp;date=2015-10-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=186&amp;au=Fotaris%2C+Panagiotis%3BMastoras%2C+Theodoros%3BLeinfellner%2C+Richard%3BRosunally%2C+Yasmine&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=European+Conference+on+Games+Based+Learning&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/";ProQuest Central,SciTech Premium Collection
Investigating the effects of web-mediated design thinking and co-regulated learning on developing students' computing skills in a blended course;  Issue Title: Method transfer across domains and disciplines: enriching universal access development As Internet and educational technologies are increasingly used in higher education in recent years, teachers should design and provide effective online teaching methods to help students achieve satisfactory learning performance. Based on the needs in computing courses and the necessity to build up students' regular learning habits in online learning environments, the author in this study integrated design thinking (DT) with co-regulated learning (CRL) to develop students' computing skills, and conducted a quasi-experiment to examine the effects of DT and CRL. The participants in this study were 153 undergraduates from three classes taking a compulsory course entitled 'Applied Information Technology: Data Processing.' The first class (DT and CRL group) simultaneously received the intervention of web-mediated DT and CRL, the second class (CRL group) received the intervention of web-mediated CRL, and the last group (control group) received the traditional teaching method, although teaching was conducted in a blended class. Based on the analysis carried out in this study, students who received the intervention of web-mediated DT had significantly better computing skills in using Excel than those without. In addition, web-mediated CRL also contributed to significantly better development of computing skills. The author expects that this study could provide insights into the design of web-mediated DT and CRL for teachers, educators, and schools.;1680919673;Scholarly Journals;;Tsai, Chia-wen;;; Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2015; 10.1007/s10209-015-0401-8; Feature;; Jun 2015;;1615-5289;2; English; English; 295-305; Heidelberg;Jun 2015;Universal Access in the Information Society;2015;14;https://search.proquest.com/docview/1680919673?accountid=11774;;; References;;; 295;; Learning , Students , Information technology , Educational technology;;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Asciencejournals&amp;atitle=Investigating+the+effects+of+web-mediated+design+thinking+and+co-regulated+learning+on+developing+students%27+computing+skills+in+a+blended+course&amp;title=Universal+Access+in+the+Information+Society&amp;issn=16155289&amp;date=2015-06-01&amp;volume=14&amp;issue=2&amp;spage=295&amp;au=Tsai%2C+Chia-wen&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=Universal+Access+in+the+Information+Society&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/10.1007%2Fs10209-015-0401-8";ProQuest Central,SciTech Premium Collection

Investigating The Effects Of Self-Directed Learning And Collaborative Methods On Junior Secondary School Students Social Studies Learning Outcomes In Oyo State, Nigeria;Learner-centred methods of teaching are rarely used in most Nigerian classrooms. Pedagogic practices at the basic level of education encourage teacher-dominated methods that do not allow for students’ active participation and inculcation of behavioural changes that reflect the outcomes of learning Social studies. As a paradigm shift, the main effects of treatments (Self-directed learning, Collaborative task method and a combination of the two methods), gender and achievement motivation on the combined dependent variables of achievement in Social studies and critical thinking were investigated. Three hypotheses stated were tested at the 0.05 level of significance. A pre-test post-test non-randomised control group design was adopted in which treatments were crossed with two levels of achievement motivation and gender respectively. 223 males and 136 female students were randomly selected from 12 junior secondary schools in Oyo State. Three instruments: Academic Achievement Motivation Inventory (α = 0.83), Critical Thinking Disposition Inventory (α = 0.87) and Social Studies Achievement Test (r = 0.80) were used to collect data from the participants. Using Multivariate Analysis of Covariance (MANCOVA), Self-directed learning proved to be most significant in improving the learning of Social studies concepts, followed by a combination of Self-directed learning and Collaborative task methods while the Collaborative task method was the least effective. Gender and achievement motivation had significant effects on students’ achievement and not on critical thinking. The findings have implications for the teaching of Social studies in Nigeria. If the rationale of instruction is to enhance the acquisition of cognitive learning outcome with the teacher acting as a facilitator, then the Self-directed learning is most beneficial to students followed by a combination of Self-directed learning and Collaborative task method. When students are actively involved in the teaching-learning process, their academic achievement is more enhanced, especially when a conducive environment is provided.;2343798879;Scholarly Journals;;"Oyediji, O;Okwilagwe, E";;; © 2015.

A description and exploration of how four teachers interpret and practice BSAA curriculum;"This study explored secondary agriculture education as practiced by four teachers and sought to examine and describe how they interpreted and practiced the Biological Science Applications in Agriculture (BSAA) curriculum. The following questions were examined: (a) What does BSAA teaching look like in practice? (b) How do teachers perceive their teaching of BSAA curriculum? (c) What role does inquiry play in BSAA classes? (d) Do teachers’ practice and perceptions align? (e) How are science and agriculture blended in BSAA? On what do teachers base this decision? This study used a qualitative research design. The theoretical framework included two perspectives: the Theory of Planned Behavior (Ajzen, 1991) and the Sociocultural Model of Embedded Belief Systems. A phenomenological approach was used to explore, describe and analyze the lived experiences of the four teachers. Data collection procedures included semi-structured interviews and observations of participants’ practice. Data were coded and analyzed using Saldana’s (2009) codes theory model for qualitative inquiry, and Glaser &amp; Strauss’s (1965) constant comparative method. The findings from my research described participants’ implementation of the BSAA curriculum. The findings indicated (a) these teachers used a variety of instructional approaches ranging from traditional lecture to inquiry-based learning, and (b) while they blended science and agriculture content in their instruction no teacher taught one to the exclusion of the other. (c) Teachers said they valued BSAA as a context in which to teach science, and (d) all four teachers professed adequate knowledge of science content to feel comfortable teaching BSAA, although their self-described understanding of the use of inquiry ranged from uncertain to proficient.";1816991629;Dissertations & Theses;;Still, Steven McKenzie;;;" Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.";; Dissertation/Thesis;; 2015; 978-1-369-06588-6;;; English; English;;;2015;ProQuest Dissertations and Theses;2015;;https://search.proquest.com/docview/1816991629?accountid=11774; 0443 Educational evaluation , 0517 Agricultural education , 0533 Secondary education , 0727 Curriculum development; 0443 Educational evaluation , 0517 Agricultural education , 0533 Secondary education , 0727 Curriculum development;; 0443 Educational evaluation , 0517 Agricultural education , 0533 Secondary education , 0727 Curriculum development;;; 0443 Educational evaluation , 0517 Agricultural education , 0533 Secondary education , 0727 Curriculum development; Educational evaluation , Agricultural education , Secondary education , Curriculum development; Education , Agriscience , Biological science applications in agriculture , Inquiry;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:Education+Database&amp;atitle=&amp;title=A+description+and+exploration+of+how+four+teachers+interpret+and+practice+BSAA+curriculum&amp;issn=&amp;date=2015-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Still%2C+Steven+McKenzie&amp;isbn=978-1-369-06588-6&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/";ProQuest Central,Social Science Premium Collection
Cross-cultural experiences of Asian international graduate students enrolled in a 'pier II university in rural Texas: A phenomenological study;According to market-driven strategies applied in higher education, negative outcomes of the world-widely expanded market in the international education have been a concern. Therefore, reflecting the current trend of student mobility with an increasing number of Asian international students in particular, it is critical to understand their cross-cultural experiences within a specific university context. This qualitative study, phenomenological study in particular, was conducted through in-depth individual interviews of five participants. By utilizing phenomenological reduction analysis, the three themes, recognizing differences, facing difficulties, and coping with difficulties emerged along with sub-themes and codes, which reflected an ecological and bidimensional process of adjustment.

Undergraduate engineering students' understanding of complex circuits: an investigation of the intersection of students' prior knowledge, design of learning environments and the nature of the content;Research focused on increasing students’ conceptual understanding of electric circuits discuss this concept as difficult to not only teach but for students to grasp. This difficulty has been attributed to the fact that students tend to hold inaccurate pre-conceptions of electricity which becomes problematic as the level of complexity increases from the most basic to more advanced circuit concepts. The combination of inaccurate and inadequate prior knowledge has the potential to prevent students from being able to assimilate new material they come in contact with when instructed about electric circuit concepts in formal settings. Often times, students’ inability to associate this new concept with correct pre-existing conception or prior knowledge leads to the development of misconceptions about the nature of electricity. With these issues in mind, this study focused on exploring undergraduate engineering students’ conceptual understanding of electric circuits through an investigation of three interconnected areas. The overall purpose of this study was to give a descriptive account of learning complex circuits. This dissertation took the form of three stand-alone in-depth studies aimed at answering the broad overarching question of: what are the underlying reasons for students’ perceived difficulty in learning complex circuit concepts? Using three distinct methods of inquiry such as an inductive/deductive thematic analysis of historical data, a systematic literature review of published work and a single descriptive case study with multiple embedded units, the central theme of this study was the alignment of prior knowledge, design of learning environments and how concepts are taught. The common finding of this work highlighted the lack of alignment between content, assessment and pedagogy. It was also found that in introductory courses students are exposed to concepts mostly in a mathematical way without much emphasis on the use of qualitative discussions. These results have significant implications for the teaching and practice of engineering. In addition, this work contributes to the body of literature on complex circuits such as alternating current (AC) circuits and students’ conceptual understanding. The model used to guide the study in terms of how the three individual studies support each other and align with the overarching research question provide useful information that can significantly improve the methods used to teach students complex concepts in introductory courses.;1777609494;Dissertations & Theses;;Pitterson, Nicole P.;;;" Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.";; Dissertation/Thesis;; 2015; 978-1-339-58407-2;;; English; English;;;2015;ProQuest Dissertations and Theses;2015;;https://search.proquest.com/docview/1777609494?accountid=11774; 0515 Education , 0537 Engineering; 0515 Education , 0537 Engineering;; 0515 Education , 0537 Engineering;;; 0515 Education , 0537 Engineering; Education , Engineering; Applied sciences , Education , Complex circuits , Conceptual change , Electrical engineering , Introductory courses , Learning environment design;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:Education+Database&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Undergraduate+engineering+students%27+understanding+of+complex+circuits%3A+an+investigation+of+the+intersection+of+students%27+prior+knowledge%2C+design+of+learning+environments+and+the+nature+of+the+content&amp;issn=&amp;date=2015-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Pitterson%2C+Nicole+P.&amp;isbn=978-1-339-58407-2&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/";ProQuest Central,Social Science Premium Collection
A Study of Student Perceptions on Adaptive Learning Systems in College Algebra and Their Effect on Learning Outcomes;Low levels of student success in introductory college math courses are rampant. There are several reasons for low pass rates in these courses, with the most serious issue being lack of concept mastery. To aid students in concept mastery, adaptive learning systems were created. These systems adapt instruction for each student and create an individualized learning path, opening new content areas only after the student masters the current content area. However, research on adaptive learning systems is very limited, as these systems are somewhat new, and the research is lacking especially in mathematics courses where the systems are needed most. The purpose of this study was to examine students' self-reported satisfaction about the use of the adaptive learning system. Additionally, final grades of students who used the system were compared to the final grades of students who did not use the system. The results revealed that student satisfaction with mathematics in general did not affect their perceptions about the adaptive learning system and its benefits to their learning. However, overall student satisfaction with the system was low and they did not consider the system beneficial. Nonetheless, students who used the system had higher final grades than students who did not use the system. Therefore, it would benefit students to improve the system based on their suggestions and continue its use in introductory math courses.;1773365690;Dissertations & Theses;;Stuve, Claire;;;" Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.";; Dissertation/Thesis;; 2015; 978-1-339-52984-4;;; English; English;;;2015;ProQuest Dissertations and Theses;2015;;https://search.proquest.com/docview/1773365690?accountid=11774; 0280 Mathematics education , 0443 Educational evaluation , 0710 Educational technology , 0745 Higher education; 0280 Mathematics education , 0443 Educational evaluation , 0710 Educational technology , 0745 Higher education;; 0280 Mathematics education , 0443 Educational evaluation , 0710 Educational technology , 0745 Higher education;;; 0280 Mathematics education , 0443 Educational evaluation , 0710 Educational technology , 0745 Higher education; Mathematics education , Educational evaluation , Educational technology , Higher education; Education , Adaptive learning systems , College algebra , Learning outcomes , Student perceptions;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:Education+Database&amp;atitle=&amp;title=A+Study+of+Student+Perceptions+on+Adaptive+Learning+Systems+in+College+Algebra+and+Their+Effect+on+Learning+Outcomes&amp;issn=&amp;date=2015-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Stuve%2C+Claire&amp;isbn=978-1-339-52984-4&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/";ProQuest Central,Social Science Premium Collection
An investigation of the efficacy of mind maps in software development among individuals and pairs;Software development is a cognitively demanding endeavor in which the creation and exchange of knowledge is paramount. Collaborative development, particularly pair programming, has been more advocated and adopted recently by practitioners. However, empirical studies have not categorically established the efficacy of pairs vis-à-vis individuals in software design contexts. In fact, recent findings suggest that pairs seldom outperform best individuals although they tend to do better than average individuals. Group losses arising from lack of coordination and/or communication could be a plausible explanation for this. The extant literature suggests that Mind Maps have the potential to graphically capture concepts and their relationships and hence can promote a shared understanding of the problem being solved. This shared understanding, in turn, can facilitate communication and coordination. This study, anchored in the theoretical foundations of distributed cognition, investigates the impact that Mind Maps have on the performance of pairs vis-à-vis individuals engaged in a design task.;1768733795;Dissertations & Theses;;Bond, Philip L.;;;" Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.";; Dissertation/Thesis;; 2015; 978-1-339-51585-4;;; English; English;;;2015;ProQuest Dissertations and Theses;2015;;https://search.proquest.com/docview/1768733795?accountid=11774; 0310 Business administration; 0310 Business administration;; 0310 Business administration;;; 0310 Business administration; Business administration; Social sciences , Agile programming , Artifacts and external representations , Distributed cognition , Mind maps , Pair programming;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ABI%2FINFORM+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=An+investigation+of+the+efficacy+of+mind+maps+in+software+development+among+individuals+and+pairs&amp;issn=&amp;date=2015-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Bond%2C+Philip+L.&amp;isbn=978-1-339-51585-4&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/";ProQuest Central
Technology, talk, and time: Patterns of group communication and identity;The effective use of technology is increasingly important in many fields where online and digital communication, collaboration, and production have become more prevalent. Although it is clear that many higher education students come into the classroom with skills involved with consuming technology, they often are much less capable of producing technology, such as editing videos or creating websites. Recently, many K-12 and higher education institutions have been redesigning instructional methods to better meet the needs of students in today’s work environment through teaching collaborative, authentic technology tasks. Relatively few studies have examined the role of student communication practices in technology classrooms that involve collaboration and authentic tasks, so this dissertation describes a multiple-semester, comparative case study of student communication patterns and themes. Operating as an engaged observer, I monitored an advanced Web design course during three semesters to better understand how students’ communication practice influence their collaboration on authentic tasks. Through participant observation, in-depth interviews, gathering student documents, and transcription of group talk, I was able to use Situated Learning theory to examine the way students talk about their activities and proceed through a 16-week learning period. An inductive analysis revealed several discursive patterns and practices including how using technology influenced their communication practices and their development (or not) as a community of practice. These patterns are also discussed in light of their enabling and constraining qualities and the extent to which they echo discourses within other technology classrooms. Particular focus is given to the development and process of student learning teams, categorized into stages, from Individualism, Coalescing, Maturing and Identity formation, to Production and Transformation. Finally, Situated Learning theory’s and small group communication’s notions of discourse is extended within the technical sphere, as students both use and create new technologies, to become Community of Practice Development theory (CPDT).;1765461300;Dissertations & Theses;;Dahl, Laura Brown;;;" Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.";; Dissertation/Thesis;; 2015; 978-1-339-46976-8;;; English; English;;;2015;ProQuest Dissertations and Theses;2015;;https://search.proquest.com/docview/1765461300?accountid=11774; 0459 Communication , 0710 Educational technology , 0984 Computer science; 0459 Communication , 0710 Educational technology , 0984 Computer science;; 0459 Communication , 0710 Educational technology , 0984 Computer science;;; 0459 Communication , 0710 Educational technology , 0984 Computer science; Communication , Educational technology , Computer science; Communication and the arts , Applied sciences , Education , Collaboration , Group communication , Qualitative research , Situated learning theory , Stages , Web design;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:Social+Science+Database&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Technology%2C+talk%2C+and+time%3A+Patterns+of+group+communication+and+identity&amp;issn=&amp;date=2015-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Dahl%2C+Laura+Brown&amp;isbn=978-1-339-46976-8&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/";ProQuest Central,Social Science Premium Collection
A qualitative study of classroom strategies that support elementary school students diagnosed with ADHD;In 2002, approximately 1.6 million elementary school students were diagnosed as having attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Students diagnosed as having ADHD can be faced with everyday challenges regarding their academic and behavior skills within their learning environment. Although much research has been conducted, there has not been, to date, a single definitive discussion with regards to plausible teaching strategies for professional educators to use with children diagnosed with this disorder. In response to this gap in theory and practice, a qualitative approach was selected in an attempt to fill the gap in the literature. It is within this specific study that successful strategies and techniques employed by elementary teachers are unveiled in an effort to support students with ADHD with their academic and behavioral skills. Also unveiled are the attitudes, beliefs, and perceptions of experienced elementary teachers having taught ADHD students. A central focus question for this study was what specific practices are being employed by elementary educators to support ADHD students with their academics and behavior? The theoretical framework associated with this study stems from three theorists: Jean Piaget, Albert Bandura, and B. F. Skinner. Ten semi-structured interviews were conducted to uncover the findings for this study.;1760167859;Dissertations & Theses;;Green, Carla;;;" Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.";; Dissertation/Thesis;; 2015; 978-1-339-39839-6;;; English; English;;;2015;ProQuest Dissertations and Theses;2015;;https://search.proquest.com/docview/1760167859?accountid=11774; 0384 Behavioral psychology , 0518 Early childhood education; 0384 Behavioral psychology , 0518 Early childhood education;; 0384 Behavioral psychology , 0518 Early childhood education;;; 0384 Behavioral psychology , 0518 Early childhood education; Behavioral psychology , Early childhood education; Psychology , Education , ADHD , Academics , Behavior , Disabilities , Elementary students , Emotions;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:Psychology+Database&amp;atitle=&amp;title=A+qualitative+study+of+classroom+strategies+that+support+elementary+school+students+diagnosed+with+ADHD&amp;issn=&amp;date=2015-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Green%2C+Carla&amp;isbn=978-1-339-39839-6&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/";ProQuest Central
Learning by game design for library instruction A Multiple Case;Despite the importance placed on information literacy in fostering lifelong learning, helping students develop the skills required of critical thinkers and independent learners are limited. This study contributes to the burgeoning discourse on alternative instructional approaches to teaching information literacy and focuses on the use of game design in learning environments. The appeal of gaming among the younger generation of learners has led to the increasing use of games in learning environments. Within recent years, some innovative academic libraries have begun adopting games as a platform for information literacy instruction. While the literature recognizes game design as fostering higher-level learning in educational contexts, it is not commonly adopted in the classroom. Typically, there is a preference among instructors to have students play games. Therefore, a more thorough understanding on the ways game design best facilitate learning is needed to assist towards its more frequent adoption. This study focuses on the use of game design within library spaces. The purpose of this study is to explore the experiences of undergraduate students learning by game design in information literacy classes. The overarching research question looks at how an instructor can incorporate motivational theories into an information literacy class through learning by game design and how students engage with the content and each other in this environment. More specific supporting questions address: How can an instructor incorporate motivational theories into an information literacy class through “learning by game design”? How does the “learning by game design” approach within information literacy classes foster the sharing of knowledge among undergraduate students? How do undergraduate students represent information literacy concepts in the game-based artifacts they design? What were undergraduate students’ motivations to use information literacy practices they were exposed to throughout their class experiences? Applying a descriptive multi-site case study methodology, this study draws upon the theories of social constructivism, experiential learning, and motivation to explore the phenomenon of learning by game design in information literacy classes. Data was collected from two sites using various methods to provide a comprehensive view of the phenomenon. Data sources included: student's artifacts, submitted class assessment materials, recorded observation, participant observation, items from the Intrinsic Motivation Inventory (IMI) and interviews. Analysis was done by drawing meanings across the multiple instances of data. Findings from this study show that learning by game design is a viable option for teaching information literacy classes, when effectively scaffolded into the classroom. Students were able to draw upon a higher order of cognition and described situated instances where information literacy skills were applied, such as use in complex assignments and real world situations.;1758891591;Dissertations & Theses;;Ramnarine-Rieks, Angela U.;;;" Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.";; Dissertation/Thesis;; 2015; 978-1-339-41316-7;;; English; English;;;2015;ProQuest Dissertations and Theses;2015;;https://search.proquest.com/docview/1758891591?accountid=11774; 0399 Library science , 0710 Educational technology , 0723 Information science; 0399 Library science , 0710 Educational technology , 0723 Information science;; 0399 Library science , 0710 Educational technology , 0723 Information science;;; 0399 Library science , 0710 Educational technology , 0723 Information science; Library science , Educational technology , Information science; Communication and the arts , Education , Experiential learning , Game design , Higher education , Information literacy , Self determination theory , Social constructivism;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:Library+Science+Database&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Learning+by+game+design+for+library+instruction+A+Multiple+Case&amp;issn=&amp;date=2015-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Ramnarine-Rieks%2C+Angela+U.&amp;isbn=978-1-339-41316-7&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/";ProQuest Central,Social Science Premium Collection
Sensitivity analysis for linear structural equation models, longitudinal mediation with latent growth models and blended learning in biostatistics education;"In chapter 1, we consider the biases that may arise when an unmeasured confounder is omitted from a structural equation model (SEM) and sensitivity analysis techniques to correct for such biases. We give an analysis of which effects in an SEM are and are not biased by an unmeasured confounder. It is shown that a single unmeasured confounder will bias not just one but numerous effects in an SEM. We present sensitivity analysis techniques to correct for biases in total, direct, and indirect effects when using SEM analyses, and illustrate these techniques with a study of aging and cognitive function. In chapter 2, we consider longitudinal mediation with latent growth curves. We define the direct and indirect effects using counterfactuals and consider the assumptions needed for identifiability of those effects. We develop models with a binary treatment/exposure followed by a model where treatment/exposure changes with time allowing for treatment/exposure-mediator interaction. We thus formalize mediation analysis with latent growth curve models using counterfactuals, makes clear the assumptions and extends these methods to allow for exposure mediator interactions. We present and illustrate the techniques with a study on Multiple Sclerosis(MS) and depression. In chapter 3, we report on a pilot study in blended learning that took place during the Fall 2013 and Summer 2014 semesters here at Harvard. We blended the traditional BIO 200: Principles of Biostatistics and created ID 200: Principles of Biostatistics and epidemiology. We used materials from the edX course PH207x: Health in Numbers: Quantitative Methods in Clinical &amp; Public Health Research and used. These materials were used as a video textbook in which students would watch a given number of these videos prior to class. Using surveys as well as exam data we informally assess these blended classes from the student's perspective as well as a comparison of these students with students in another course, BIO 201: Introduction to Statistical Methods in Fall 2013 as well as students from BIO 200 in Fall semesters of 1992 and 1993. We then suggest improvements upon our original course designs and follow up with an informal look at how these implemented changes affected the second offering of the newly blended ID 200 in Summer 2014.";1747413614;Dissertations & Theses;;Sullivan, Adam John;;;" Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.";; Dissertation/Thesis;; 2015; 978-1-339-29638-8;;; English; English;;;2015;ProQuest Dissertations and Theses;2015;;https://search.proquest.com/docview/1747413614?accountid=11774; 0463 Statistics , 0710 Educational technology , 0714 Science education , 0745 Higher education; 0463 Statistics , 0710 Educational technology , 0714 Science education , 0745 Higher education;; 0463 Statistics , 0710 Educational technology , 0714 Science education , 0745 Higher education;;; 0463 Statistics , 0710 Educational technology , 0714 Science education , 0745 Higher education; Statistics , Educational technology , Science education , Higher education; Pure sciences , Education , Blended learning , Flipped learning , Latent growth curves , Mediation , Sensitivity analysis , Statistics education , Structural equation model;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:Advanced+Technologies+%26+Aerospace+Dissertations&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Sensitivity+analysis+for+linear+structural+equation+models%2C+longitudinal+mediation+with+latent+growth+models+and+blended+learning+in+biostatistics+education&amp;issn=&amp;date=2015-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Sullivan%2C+Adam+John&amp;isbn=978-1-339-29638-8&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/";SciTech Premium Collection
Interactive whiteboards and TPACK for technology-enhanced learning: Secondary mathematics teachers' barriers, beliefs, and support needs in one rural school district;"Low-income students and blacks make up nearly half of public school students, and on nearly every indicator of educational access, particularly technology, these students have less access than white affluent students (Darling-Hammond, Zielezinski, and Goldman, 2014). The National Center for Education Statistics (2005) reported that teacher quality and missed opportunities to learn accounted for 93% of African Americans, and 87% of Hispanics performing below proficiency in mathematics. Students that do not master mathematics standards by the end of compulsory education are less likely to complete general mathematics courses in upper secondary school and beyond successfully (Levpuš?ek, Zupan?i?, &amp; So?an, 2013). Interactive whiteboards (IWBs) can support student engagement, interest and possibly increased achievement in mathematics if used effectively. The purposes of this study were to (a) examine the perspectives of secondary mathematics teachers with regard to the use of IWBs for teaching, (b) determine how secondary mathematics teachers in one school district use the IWB to guide students toward mathematical proficiency, and (c) consider how secondary mathematics teachers’ perspectives in one school district were influenced by 1 st order and 2 nd order barriers to technology integration. The following factors were considered when examining the context needed to better understand the complexities using IWBs effectively in mathematics: (a) Niess et al. (2009) Mathematics Teachers’ TPACK Development Model, (b) Miller and Glover (2005) stages of IWB use, and (c) Ertmer (1999) first-order and second-order barriers to technology integration. The data revealed that at each stage of IWB use (a) supported didactic, (b) interactive, and (c) enhanced interactivity, teachers faced a unique combination of first-order and second-order barriers to IWB integration that affected how IWBs were used for teaching mathematics. The results of the data suggest that as barriers are resolved at each stage of IWB use, the likelihood mathematics teachers will effectively use IWBs to teach mathematics will increase. Suggestions including administrator support and modifying professional development practices are included to provide educators and policy makers the practical knowledge needed to inform sustainable plans for integrating IWBs effectively.";1737745179;Dissertations & Theses;;Brown, Shelita McCadney;;;" Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.";; Dissertation/Thesis;; 2015; 978-1-339-26316-8;;; English; English;;;2015;ProQuest Dissertations and Theses;2015;;https://search.proquest.com/docview/1737745179?accountid=11774; 0280 Mathematics education , 0449 Educational leadership , 0710 Educational technology; 0280 Mathematics education , 0449 Educational leadership , 0710 Educational technology;; 0280 Mathematics education , 0449 Educational leadership , 0710 Educational technology;;; 0280 Mathematics education , 0449 Educational leadership , 0710 Educational technology; Mathematics education , Educational leadership , Educational technology; Education , Interactive whiteboards , Nvivo , Secondary mathematics teachers , Teacher beliefs , Technology integration , Tpack;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:Education+Database&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Interactive+whiteboards+and+TPACK+for+technology-enhanced+learning%3A+Secondary+mathematics+teachers%27+barriers%2C+beliefs%2C+and+support+needs+in+one+rural+school+district&amp;issn=&amp;date=2015-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Brown%2C+Shelita+McCadney&amp;isbn=978-1-339-26316-8&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/";ProQuest Central,Social Science Premium Collection
Phenomenological study of higher educational leaders' lived experiences of cultural diversity after 9/11;The purpose of the qualitative descriptive phenomenological study was to explore higher educational leaders’ lived experiences of cultural diversity after the 9/11 terrorist attacks in the United States. The descriptive accounts of higher educational leaders’ lived experiences of cultural diversity after 9/11 resulted in nine themes. The nine themes included (a) emotional confusion research participants experienced following 9/11, (b) concerns regarding personal security experienced by the research participants after 9/11, and (c) awareness of social and professional interactions with minorities. The other themes were (d) tendency to culturally stereotype international or multiethnic people following 9/11, (e) awareness of a high number of controversial political references of participants. The next sets of themes were (f) media perpetuates cultural stereotypes following 9/11, (g) occurrences of social or professional conflicts after 9/11, and (h) interest in diversity initiatives and programs initiated following 9/11. The final theme was (i) advocacy of responsible, inclusive, and nondiscriminatory leadership practices in higher education. Conclusions drawn from the study indicated the presence of opportunities for change in higher education. Three recommendations are made: (a) Create a communication and behavior watchdog committee to monitor issues relating to diversity, race, and cultural infractions on campuses. (b) Hold mandatory quarterly professional development training for administration, faculty, and staff in sensitivity training.

Social emotional learning in the music classroom: A cross-case analysis of teacher experiences in the rock and roll academy;The purpose of this study is to examine the experiences of teachers in the Rock and Roll Academy (RRA), a music program designed to meet social emotional learning (SEL) objectives. This endeavor was undertaken to fill the existing research gap related to understanding the unique challenges and dynamics experienced by teachers within a commonly designed SEL environment. It employed a qualitative case study approach, providing individual and cross case analyses based on the analysis of text collected through field observations and multiple interviews of five teacher participants who trained for and teach within a Rock and Roll Academy program. Findings indicate that prior to teaching RRA, participants possessed a bias for traditional, teacher-centered educational practices. Additionally, findings identified value related to teacher preparation and training. Within the area of teacher activity, RRA evidence shows teachers engage in student-centered pedagogy, and promote social engagement within the classroom. Last, in the area of teacher outlook, research findings show teachers demonstrate program commitment and commonly identify developing SEL focus. Information contained within this study may be helpful to those who teach a classroom-based SEL program. This research may also be useful to school administrators interested in implementing an SEL program of design similar to RRA and would offer a greater understanding of qualities helpful to the facilitation of SEL in the classroom and important information about potential challenges related to its implementation.;1733231109;Dissertations & Theses;;Atkinson, Paul;;;" Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.";; Dissertation/Thesis;; 2015; 978-1-339-10580-2;;; English; English;;;2015;ProQuest Dissertations and Theses;2015;;https://search.proquest.com/docview/1733231109?accountid=11774; 0522 Music education , 0525 Educational psychology; 0522 Music education , 0525 Educational psychology;; 0522 Music education , 0525 Educational psychology;;; 0522 Music education , 0525 Educational psychology; Music education , Educational psychology; Education , Social constructivism , Social constructivist , Social emotional learning;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:Education+Database&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Social+emotional+learning+in+the+music+classroom%3A+A+cross-case+analysis+of+teacher+experiences+in+the+rock+and+roll+academy&amp;issn=&amp;date=2015-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Atkinson%2C+Paul&amp;isbn=978-1-339-10580-2&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/";ProQuest Central,Social Science Premium Collection
Teachers and Technology Use in Secondary Science Classrooms: Investigating the Experiences of Middle School Science Teachers Implementing the Web-based Inquiry Science Environment (WISE);This study investigated the intended teacher use of a technology-enhanced learning tool, Web-based Inquiry Science Environment (WISE), and the first experiences of teachers new to using it and untrained in its use. The purpose of the study was to learn more about the factors embedded into the design of the technology that enabled it or hindered it from being used as intended. The qualitative research design applied grounded theory methods. Using theoretical sampling and a constant comparative analysis, a document review of WISE website led to a model of intended teacher use. The experiences of four middle school science teachers as they enacted WISE for the first time were investigated through ethnographic field observations, surveys and interviews using thematic analysis to construct narratives of each teachers use. These narratives were compared to the model of intended teacher use of WISE. This study found two levels of intended teacher uses for WISE. A basic intended use involved having student running the project to completion while the teacher provides feedback and assesses student learning. A more optimal description of intended use involved the supplementing the core curriculum with WISE as well as enhancing the core scope and sequence of instruction and aligning assessment with the goals of instruction through WISE. Moreover, WISE projects were optimally intended to be facilitated through student-centered teaching practices and inquiry-based instruction in a collaborative learning environment. It is also optimally intended for these projects to be shared with other colleagues for feedback and iterative development towards improving the Knowledge Integration of students. Of the four teachers who participated in this study, only one demonstrated the use of WISE as intended in the most basic way. This teacher also demonstrated the use of WISE in a number of optimal ways. Teacher confusion with certain tools available within WISE suggests that there may be a way to develop the user experience through these touch points and help teachers learn how to use the technology as they are selecting and setting up a project run. Further research may study whether improving these touch points can improve the teachers’ use of WISE as intended both basically and optimally. It may also study whether or not teacher in basic and optimal ways directly impact student learning results.;1731940680;Dissertations & Theses;;Schulz, Rachel Corinne;;;" Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.";; Dissertation/Thesis;; 2015; 978-1-339-22605-7;;; English; English;;;2015;ProQuest Dissertations and Theses;2015;;https://search.proquest.com/docview/1731940680?accountid=11774; 0710 Educational technology , 0714 Science education; 0710 Educational technology , 0714 Science education;; 0710 Educational technology , 0714 Science education;;; 0710 Educational technology , 0714 Science education; Educational technology , Science education; Education , Educational technology , Learning environments , Science , Teacher use , User design , Wise;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:Education+Database&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Teachers+and+Technology+Use+in+Secondary+Science+Classrooms%3A+Investigating+the+Experiences+of+Middle+School+Science+Teachers+Implementing+the+Web-based+Inquiry+Science+Environment+%28WISE%29&amp;issn=&amp;date=2015-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Schulz%2C+Rachel+Corinne&amp;isbn=978-1-339-22605-7&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/";ProQuest Central,Social Science Premium Collection
An Investigation of the Relationship of Teachers' Attitudes Towards a Computer-Based Assessment System and Student Achievement;Since the introduction of No Child Left Behind (NCLB), districts across the country implemented computerized benchmark, or interim assessments, into their curriculum as a means to monitor and improve student achievement. Often, a change in curriculum entails a demand of educators’ time, whether through professional development or lesson planning, and therefore affects teachers’ attitudes. The purpose of this study was to determine what, if any, relationship there was among middle school teachers’ attitudes, monthly computerized benchmark assessments, and student scores on the Missouri Assessment Program (MAP). Educators of the communication arts and mathematics content areas from one middle school were administered a survey and questionnaire to address two questions: 1) What are teachers’ attitudes regarding the use of the Tungsten Learning System in the areas of reading and mathematics, and 2) How, if at all, do teachers change their behaviors in regards to the monthly reports of the Tungsten Learning System? Both assessment tools addressed categories of Training or Comfort Level, Use of Tungsten Feedback, Teachers’ Perceptions of Tungsten, Accountability, and Student Preparation and Motivation. To observe if there was a difference in student achievement, as measured by the MAP, test scores of students from two middle schools of the same district, since the implementation of the Tungsten Learning System, were analyzed using ANOVA. In conclusion, the study found there was a difference in student achievement in mathematics MAP scores. Also, based on the survey and questionnaire responses, teachers did not believe Tungsten Learning System was a good predictor of student achievement. However, overall they favored computerized benchmark assessments if not administered monthly, aligned with the curriculum, provided student feedback and effective re-teaching tools, and they felt they were adequately trained. Teachers did believe their attitudes had more of an effect on their students’ attitudes than on students’ achievement.;1731202678;Dissertations & Theses;;Griffin, Felica M.;;;" Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.";; Dissertation/Thesis;; 2015; 978-1-339-22470-1;;; English; English;;;2015;ProQuest Dissertations and Theses;2015;;https://search.proquest.com/docview/1731202678?accountid=11774; 0288 Educational tests & measurements , 0458 Education Policy , 0525 Educational psychology , 0710 Educational technology; 0288 Educational tests & measurements , 0458 Education Policy , 0525 Educational psychology , 0710 Educational technology;; 0288 Educational tests & measurements , 0458 Education Policy , 0525 Educational psychology , 0710 Educational technology;;; 0288 Educational tests & measurements , 0458 Education Policy , 0525 Educational psychology , 0710 Educational technology; Educational tests & measurements , Education Policy , Educational psychology , Educational technology; Education , Computerized benchmark assessments , No child left behind , Tungsten learning system;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:Education+Database&amp;atitle=&amp;title=An+Investigation+of+the+Relationship+of+Teachers%27+Attitudes+Towards+a+Computer-Based+Assessment+System+and+Student+Achievement&amp;issn=&amp;date=2015-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Griffin%2C+Felica+M.&amp;isbn=978-1-339-22470-1&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/";ProQuest Central,Social Science Premium Collection
The relationship between project management professional certification and project health;The demand for professionally certified project managers has grown significantly since the mid-1980s and organizational policymakers today associate certification with project manager competence. Despite its popularity, there is little evidence that certification is related to improving the quality of actual projects. This study used ordinary least squares regression to examine 1,444 projects at international consulting firm RGS to assess the relationship between certification and project quality. Contrary to the hypothesis, results indicated that certification was statistically significantly correlated with poorer project quality. Effect size of .18 indicated the effect was consequential and that additional research into the underlying interactions is warranted.;1729577955;Dissertations & Theses;;Robertson, Jenifer Walsh;;;" Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.";; Dissertation/Thesis;; 2015; 978-1-339-20486-4;;; English; English;;;2015;ProQuest Dissertations and Theses;2015;;https://search.proquest.com/docview/1729577955?accountid=11774; 0688 Business education; 0688 Business education;; 0688 Business education;;; 0688 Business education; Business education; Education , Professional certification , Project management certification , Project management competency , Project management information systems , Project quality;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ABI%2FINFORM+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+relationship+between+project+management+professional+certification+and+project+health&amp;issn=&amp;date=2015-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Robertson%2C+Jenifer+Walsh&amp;isbn=978-1-339-20486-4&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/";ProQuest Central
Undergraduate engineering students' experiences of interdisciplinary learning: a phenomenographic perspective;Engineers are expected to work with people with different disciplinary knowledge to solve real-world problems that are inherently complex, which is one of the reasons that interdisciplinary learning has become a common pedagogical practice in engineering education. However, empirical evidence on the impact of interdisciplinary learning on undergraduates is lacking. Regardless of the differences in the scope of methods used to assess interdisciplinary learning, frameworks of interdisciplinary learning are imperative for developing attainable outcomes as well as interpreting assessment data. Existing models of interdisciplinary learning have been either conceptual or based on research faculty members' experiences rather than empirical data. The study addressed the gap by exploring the different ways that undergraduate engineering students experience interdisciplinary learning. A phenomenographic methodological framework was used to guide the design, data collection, and data analysis of the study. Twenty-two undergraduate engineering students with various interdisciplinary learning experiences were interviewed using semi-structured protocols. They concretely described their experiences and reflected meaning associated with those experiences. Analysis of the data revealed eight qualitatively different ways that students experience interdisciplinary learning, which include: interdisciplinary learning as (A) no awareness of differences, (B) control and assertion, (C) coping with differences, (D) navigating creative differences, (E) learning from differences, (F) bridging differences, (G) expanding intellectual boundaries, and (H) commitment to holistic perspectives. Categories D through H represent a hierarchical structure of increasingly comprehensive way of experiencing interdisciplinary learning. Further analysis uncovered two themes that varied throughout the categories: (i) engagement with differences and (ii) purpose and integration. Students whose experiences lie outside of the hierarchical structure need to engage difference in a positive manner and also have a purpose in engaging differences in order to experience interdisciplinary learning in a more comprehensive way. The results offer insights into the design of curriculum and classroom interdisciplinary experiences in engineering education.;1712955340;Dissertations & Theses;;Hsu, Ming-Chien;;;" Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.";; Dissertation/Thesis;; 2015; 978-1-321-99586-2;;; English; English;;;2015;ProQuest Dissertations and Theses;2015;;https://search.proquest.com/docview/1712955340?accountid=11774; 0515 Education , 0714 Science education , 0745 Higher education; 0515 Education , 0714 Science education , 0745 Higher education;; 0515 Education , 0714 Science education , 0745 Higher education;;; 0515 Education , 0714 Science education , 0745 Higher education; Education , Science education , Higher education; Education , Engineering students , Undergraduate students;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:Education+Database&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Undergraduate+engineering+students%27+experiences+of+interdisciplinary+learning%3A+a+phenomenographic+perspective&amp;issn=&amp;date=2015-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Hsu%2C+Ming-Chien&amp;isbn=978-1-321-99586-2&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/";ProQuest Central,Social Science Premium Collection
Developing collective learning extension for rapidly evolving information system courses;Due to rapidly evolving Information System (IS) technologies, instructors find themselves stuck in the constant game of catching up. On the same hand students find their skills obsolete almost as soon as they graduate. As part of IS curriculum and education, we need to emphasize more on teaching the students ‘how to learn’ while keeping the curriculum up to date. Toward this direction, we develop collective learning extension leveraging social media and implement in three IS courses at the University of Arkansas at Little Rock. Collective learning extension is adaptable to existing learning paradigms. Collective learning extension is not a new learning paradigm but it is supporting the existing learning paradigms. Collective learning extension creates a curriculum development strategy that produces a nimble curriculum adaptive to the rapidly evolving technologies. It encourages collaborative and participatory learning among students and promotes self-learning, critical thinking, and non-linear learning skills. Collective learning extension emphasizes teamwork, coordination, and strengthening interpersonal skills, preparing the students as the next-generation workforce. Collective learning extension uses social media technologies for learners. It encourages students for better collaboration. In this research, students experience is evaluated on collective learning extension and data is collected from formative and summative surveys in the classes.;1711788346;Dissertations & Theses;;Ahmed, Faysal;;;" Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.";; Dissertation/Thesis;; 2015; 978-1-321-97592-5;;; English; English;;;2015;ProQuest Dissertations and Theses;2015;;https://search.proquest.com/docview/1711788346?accountid=11774; 0534 Social studies education , 0710 Educational technology , 0723 Information science; 0534 Social studies education , 0710 Educational technology , 0723 Information science;; 0534 Social studies education , 0710 Educational technology , 0723 Information science;;; 0534 Social studies education , 0710 Educational technology , 0723 Information science; Social studies education , Educational technology , Information science; Communication and the arts , Education , Collaborative learning , Collective learning , Information system curriculum , Rapidly evolving topics , Social media , Wiki;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:Education+Database&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Developing+collective+learning+extension+for+rapidly+evolving+information+system+courses&amp;issn=&amp;date=2015-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Ahmed%2C+Faysal&amp;isbn=978-1-321-97592-5&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/";ProQuest Central,Social Science Premium Collection
Digital games for 21st century learning: Teacher librarians' beliefs and practices;Digital games as tools for learning in K–12 have been a topic of intense discussion over the last 15 years. One area of focus has been on the integration of commercial off-the-shelf games in lesson plans. A predictive factor for the adoption and integration of digital games is the attitudes or readiness of teachers. Yet, while many studies have examined this with teachers themselves, teacher librarians (TLs) have largely been ignored, despite the key role they play in education and technology adoption in schools. This study attempted to determine TLs’ beliefs and practices about digital games as 21st century learning tools, to examine similarities and differences with those of classroom teachers, and to see if and how TLs’ pedagogical beliefs impacted their perceptions of barriers toward digital game adoption. The Teachers’ Attitudes Toward Games (TATG) Survey measured TLs’ perceptions of barriers to using digital games. Findings suggest that TLs tended to use digital games to address discrete library skills—a behaviorist practice—despite the fact that they tended to hold constructivist pedagogical beliefs. Though, evidence showed that some were using games to integrate 21st century skills into classroom lessons. Similar to findings on classroom teachers, TLs perceived lack of time, lack of infrastructure, and lack of support as barriers to using digital games. Furthermore, TLs with behaviorist beliefs tended to perceive greater barriers to using digital games as compared to TLs with constructivist beliefs.;1700356909;Dissertations & Theses;;Hovious, Amanda S.;;;" Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.";; Dissertation/Thesis;; 2015; 978-1-321-90968-5;;; English; English;;;2015;ProQuest Dissertations and Theses;2015;;https://search.proquest.com/docview/1700356909?accountid=11774; 0399 Library science , 0710 Educational technology; 0399 Library science , 0710 Educational technology;; 0399 Library science , 0710 Educational technology;;; 0399 Library science , 0710 Educational technology; Library science , Educational technology; Communication and the arts , Education , Beliefs and practices , Digital game-based learning , Educational technology , School librarians , Technology adoption , Technology leadership;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:Library+Science+Database&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Digital+games+for+21st+century+learning%3A+Teacher+librarians%27+beliefs+and+practices&amp;issn=&amp;date=2015-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Hovious%2C+Amanda+S.&amp;isbn=978-1-321-90968-5&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/";ProQuest Central,Social Science Premium Collection
Blended learning in context: An exploration of the effectuality of math blended learning programs on minority students' standardized test scores;The purpose of this quantitative research study was to determine whether or not adopting a school-wide math blended learning (MBL) model led to significant differences in the Algebra I math standardized test scores on the California Standards Test (CST), between underrepresented minority students from Title I high schools in Los Angeles who had a school-wide MBL program during the 2011–2012 school year compared to underrepresented minority students from Title I high schools who did not have a school-wide MBL program. This study focused on the efficacy of the math intervention program, and was intended to further research in the area of blended learning. An one-way Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) data analysis technique was utilized and an alpha level of .05 was set as the criterion for the level of significance. Archived pre-existing standardized test data was collected from the 2011-2012 school year. The sample size consisted of the mean Algebra I CST test scores from African-American and Latino 9th grade students from 14 different Title I high schools in Los Angeles, CA. Select Title I high schools were matched to a comparison group of Title I high schools based on gender, ethnicity, and charter school designation. The results from hypotheses one, two, three, four, and five reflect that female and male African-American and Latino students who attended a Title I high school with a school-wide MBL program had a statistically significant difference in Algebra I scores compared to the students who did not. Hypothesis six indicated that there was not a statistically significant difference in Algebra I scores of students who attended Title I charter high schools compared to students who attended Title I non-charter high schools. For hypotheses one, two, three, four, and five the trend was in favor of the MBL programs. Overall, the statistical analysis indicated that there was strong evidence that MBL programs had a significant positive impact on the Algebra I test scores of all of the students who attended Title I high schools with a school-wide MBL program as compared to the students who attended a Title I high school without a school-wide MBL program.;1698254656;Dissertations & Theses;;Verrett, Shannon Jennifer;;;" Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.";; Dissertation/Thesis;; 2015; 978-1-321-90358-4;;; English; English;;;2015;ProQuest Dissertations and Theses;2015;;https://search.proquest.com/docview/1698254656?accountid=11774; 0280 Mathematics education , 0340 Educational sociology; 0280 Mathematics education , 0340 Educational sociology;; 0280 Mathematics education , 0340 Educational sociology;;; 0280 Mathematics education , 0340 Educational sociology; Mathematics education , Educational sociology; Education , Blended learning , Math education , Test scores;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:Education+Database&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Blended+learning+in+context%3A+An+exploration+of+the+effectuality+of+math+blended+learning+programs+on+minority+students%27+standardized+test+scores&amp;issn=&amp;date=2015-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Verrett%2C+Shannon+Jennifer&amp;isbn=978-1-321-90358-4&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/";ProQuest Central,Social Science Premium Collection
An analysis of the correlation between ACT scores and one-to-one computing;This study examined whether a relationship exists between one-to-one computing and student achievement, specifically ACT scores. This study also examined whether relationships exist among teachers’ perceptions of one-to-one computing, teachers’ years of experience, subjects taught by teachers, teachers’ skill level in the use of a computer for instruction, and teachers’ perceptions of changes in ACT scores. The results of this study could help policymakers and educators with decisions regarding implementation of one-to-one computing programs. The sample of schools for investigating the relationship between one-to-one computing and ACT scores consisted of 33 secondary public schools with one-to-one computing programs located in school districts from multiple states in the United States. There were 122 teachers from 12 secondary public schools with one-to-one computing programs located in school districts from multiple states in the United States who participated in a survey regarding teachers’ perceptions of one-to-one computing. Prior to the implementation of one-to-one computing and the corresponding tests in the same schools, the average student ACT composite scores and ACT subtest scores in English, math, and reading were not statistically different from what they are after two years of implementation. A statistically significant difference was found between the average student ACT subtest scores in science in schools one year prior to implementing one-to-one computing and the average student ACT subtest scores in science in the same schools two years after implementing one-to-one computing. A statistically significant difference was not found between the average change in student ACT composite score and ACT subtest scores in the state and the average change in student ACT composite score and ACT subtest scores in schools with two years of experience in implementing one-to-one computing. A statistically significant relationship was not found among teachers’ perceptions of one-to-one computing, subjects taught by teachers, teachers’ skill level in the use of a computer for instruction, and teachers’ perceptions of changes in ACT scores. A modest significant inverse relationship was found between teachers’ perceptions of one-to-one computing and teachers’ years of experience. As teachers’ years of experience increase, their perceptions of one-to-one computing tend to become less positive.;1696782222;Dissertations & Theses;;Heath, Jeffrey Brian;;;" Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.";; Dissertation/Thesis;; 2015; 978-1-321-82356-1;;; English; English;;;2015;ProQuest Dissertations and Theses;2015;;https://search.proquest.com/docview/1696782222?accountid=11774; 0288 Educational tests & measurements , 0449 Educational leadership , 0533 Secondary education; 0288 Educational tests & measurements , 0449 Educational leadership , 0533 Secondary education;; 0288 Educational tests & measurements , 0449 Educational leadership , 0533 Secondary education;;; 0288 Educational tests & measurements , 0449 Educational leadership , 0533 Secondary education; Educational tests & measurements , Educational leadership , Secondary education; Education , ACT scores , American College Testing , Computer training skills , One-to-one computing , Student achievement , Teacher training;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:Education+Database&amp;atitle=&amp;title=An+analysis+of+the+correlation+between+ACT+scores+and+one-to-one+computing&amp;issn=&amp;date=2015-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Heath%2C+Jeffrey+Brian&amp;isbn=978-1-321-82356-1&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/";ProQuest Central,Social Science Premium Collection
A study of the efficacy of the flipped classroom model in a university mathematics class;The flipped classroom is an emerging teaching practice in which teachers employ a variety of methods to offload direct instruction prior to class and use class time to engage students in active learning. Despite its rapid rise in popularity over the past five years, there are relatively few studies on the efficacy of the flipped classroom teaching model. Of these studies, few use control groups to measure changes is student learning and even fewer use iterative analysis to determine the impact that successive implementation has on the efficacy of the flipped classroom model. This study addresses this gap by measuring the efficacy of a flipped classroom against a traditionally-taught class in two successive semesters. Results showed that the flipped classroom teaching method increased student learning during the second semester of the study. It also found that successive implementation of the flipped classroom was more effective at producing gains in measures of student learning outcomes than a class taught traditionally. Finally, the findings from this study were used to develop recommendations for educators interested in implementing the flipped classroom teaching model.;1695832181;Dissertations & Theses;;Quint, Christa Lee;;;" Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.";; Dissertation/Thesis;; 2015; 978-1-321-81470-5;;; English; English;;;2015;ProQuest Dissertations and Theses;2015;;https://search.proquest.com/docview/1695832181?accountid=11774; 0280 Mathematics education , 0710 Educational technology; 0280 Mathematics education , 0710 Educational technology;; 0280 Mathematics education , 0710 Educational technology;;; 0280 Mathematics education , 0710 Educational technology; Mathematics education , Educational technology; Education , Active learning , Blended learning , Flipped classroom , Inverted learning , Lecture video , Mathematics education;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:Education+Database&amp;atitle=&amp;title=A+study+of+the+efficacy+of+the+flipped+classroom+model+in+a+university+mathematics+class&amp;issn=&amp;date=2015-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Quint%2C+Christa+Lee&amp;isbn=978-1-321-81470-5&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/";ProQuest Central,Social Science Premium Collection
A Study of External School Evaluators' Competencies for Grade Levels 1-12 Quality Assessment in Thailand;Competent school evaluators may be able to identify the causes of underachieving schools and provide data that will help school practitioners to improve teaching and learning. In Thailand, a sizeable portion of the government budget has been spent on educational evaluation under the responsibility of the Office for National Education Standards and Quality Assessment (ONESQA), highlighting the important role that school evaluators can potentially play in improving Thai schools. This study updated two sets of competencies for external educational evaluators of school quality at grade levels 1-12 in the Thai educational context as originally developed by Guah (2004) and Piyamas (2005). To conduct this update, the researcher used knowledge from the scholarly literature on evaluator competencies and, through four extensive surveys, collected opinions and suggestions from Thai evaluation and education experts as part of the process of developing a new set of competencies for Thai external school evaluators. The Combination Job Analysis Method (C-JAM) was used as a framework to collect and analyze data. Two sets of competencies, one for training and one for selecting evaluators, are proposed along with recommendations for practice and for additional research.;1667472233;Dissertations & Theses;;Roengsumran, Arisara;;;" Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.";; Dissertation/Thesis;; 2015; 978-1-321-63994-0;;; English; English;;;2015;ProQuest Dissertations and Theses;2015;;https://search.proquest.com/docview/1667472233?accountid=11774; 0443 Educational evaluation , 0514 School administration , 0638 South Asian Studies; 0443 Educational evaluation , 0514 School administration , 0638 South Asian Studies;; 0443 Educational evaluation , 0514 School administration , 0638 South Asian Studies;;; 0443 Educational evaluation , 0514 School administration , 0638 South Asian Studies; Educational evaluation , School administration , South Asian Studies; Social sciences , Education , Competency , Education , Evaluation , Evaluator , School , Thailand;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:Education+Database&amp;atitle=&amp;title=A+Study+of+External+School+Evaluators%27+Competencies+for+Grade+Levels+1-12+Quality+Assessment+in+Thailand&amp;issn=&amp;date=2015-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Roengsumran%2C+Arisara&amp;isbn=978-1-321-63994-0&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/";ProQuest Central,Social Science Premium Collection
The Influence of Cultural Capital on Student Motivation to Learn and Succeed in Bermuda Schools;Over the years, the quality of education offered by the Bermuda Public Education System (BPES) has been a source of concern for many stakeholders. A 2008 report issued on the condition of schools in Bermuda revealed significant concerns regarding the quality of schools, quality of teachers and low student academic performance. The purpose of this qualitative case study was to investigate perceptions of teachers, native and foreign students, and parents regarding the influences of the student's cultural capital on their motivation to learn and succeed in Bermuda schools. Bordieu's theory of cultural capital served as the theoretical framework. The research questions focused on the perceptions of students, parents, and teachers in senior school regarding how an individual student's cultural capital, which included habitus, confidence and self-efficacy influenced motivation to learn and academic success. Twenty-three participants were recruited with the use of a convenience sample. Five parents, nine teachers, and nine students participated in individual interviews lasting approximately one hour each. Krippendorf's technique and NVivo were used to analyze data. Seven themes emerged as a result of data analysis. These themes were: (a) Perceived qualities of successful high school student, (b) Strategies used to succeed in school, (c) Offering of academic and non-academic support services to students, (d) Intangible support systems available for students, (e) Availability of support services influences perceived confidence of high school completion, (f) Perceived contributions of teachers and staff in the success of students, and (g) Recommendations to improve educational experience. The seven themes identified in this study were crucial in answering the research questions. Implications include the need for further study on the topic.;1667091615;Dissertations & Theses;;Whyte, Icilda;;;" Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.";; Dissertation/Thesis;; 2015; 978-1-321-63223-1;;; English; English;;;2015;ProQuest Dissertations and Theses;2015;;https://search.proquest.com/docview/1667091615?accountid=11774; 0449 Educational leadership , 0727 Curriculum development; 0449 Educational leadership , 0727 Curriculum development;; 0449 Educational leadership , 0727 Curriculum development;;; 0449 Educational leadership , 0727 Curriculum development; Educational leadership , Curriculum development; Education , Academic performance , Culture capital , Work ethics;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:Education+Database&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+Influence+of+Cultural+Capital+on+Student+Motivation+to+Learn+and+Succeed+in+Bermuda+Schools&amp;issn=&amp;date=2015-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Whyte%2C+Icilda&amp;isbn=978-1-321-63223-1&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/";ProQuest Central,Social Science Premium Collection
Framework for Describing and Analyzing Context and Factors for Software Engineering Research: Applying the SEMAT Kernel;  There is currently no widely accepted approach to report software engineering research findings. It is not easy to understand the context from which a research work is conducted and factors that influences the results, and hence difficult to evaluate the applicability of findings to another context. This paper proposes a framework for describing and analyzing context and factors for software engineering research. Our proposed framework is an approach towards Theory Based Software Engineering (TBSE) that relates contextual factors and process improvement objectives systematically. Our approach towards TBSE is centered on a software engineering kernel known as Essence. Essence originates from the recent global SEMAT (Software Engineering Method and Theory) initiative and is currently an emerging standard with OMG (Object Management Group). Essence helps identify architecture views to describe the context of a software engineering endeavor. It also helps identify factors of success and make recommendations precise and actionable. This paper demonstrates the application of our proposed approach on a telecommunications case study. This case study by itself is interesting because it yielded 21% productivity gains and 58% decrease in defects. But more importantly, it demonstrates the viability of our approach in making theory practical to development teams in a systematic manner.;1533870181;Conference Papers & Proceedings;;Ng, Pan-Wei;;; Copyright IACSIT Press Nov 2014; 10.7763/LNSE.2014.V2.140; Conference Proceedings;; Nov 2014;;2301-3559;4; English; English; 300-306; Singapore;Nov 2014;Lecture Notes on Software Engineering;2014;2;https://search.proquest.com/docview/1533870181?accountid=11774;;;;;; 300;;; Software engineering , empirical , SEMAT , theory , essence , alpha , architecture view , process improvement , success factors , telecommunications;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=proceeding&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Acomputerinfo&amp;atitle=Framework+for+Describing+and+Analyzing+Context+and+Factors+for+Software+Engineering+Research%3A+Applying+the+SEMAT+Kernel&amp;title=Lecture+Notes+on+Software+Engineering&amp;issn=23013559&amp;date=2014-11-01&amp;volume=2&amp;issue=4&amp;spage=300&amp;au=Ng%2C+Pan-Wei&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=Lecture+Notes+on+Software+Engineering&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/10.7763%2FLNSE.2014.V2.140";SciTech Premium Collection
Action Possibilities of Educational Technologies in Multicultural Learning Environments;  A raft of studies have been undertaken in higher education to investigate the action possibilities and the influence information and communication technologies (ICT) may have in students' learning experiences and outcomes. Such studies have given rise to the implementation of a wide range of educational frameworks with a great deal of empirical evidence on the benefits of using technologies to improve learning. However, these benefits do not appear to have fulfilled higher education expectations for more meaningful and transformative learning experiences. In this paper, I argue that part of the problem is either the content or teacher-centric perspective of these frameworks and the need to explore the benefits from a more student-centric perspective. Learning is contextual, with learners having different abilities to learn and preferences for educational technologies with greater potential to facilitate their learning activities. Drawing on an ethnographic study of culturally diverse computing students and teachers within learning environments that blend online and face-to-face pedagogies, I argue that, that our understanding of what ICT has to offer for the design and implementation of transformative learning activities is a far more complex issue than is often anticipated, particularly in the design and implementation of learning for computer science programs.;1680486307;Conference Papers & Proceedings;;Arenas, Edilson;;; Copyright Academic Conferences International Limited Oct 2014;; Feature;; Oct 2014;;2048-8637;; English; English; 36-42; Kidmore End;Oct 2014;European Conference on e-Learning;2014;;https://search.proquest.com/docview/1680486307?accountid=11774;;;;;; 36;; Teaching , Education , Learning , Multiculturalism & pluralism , Computer science , Cognitive style , Pedagogy , Interactive media;;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aeducation&amp;atitle=Action+Possibilities+of+Educational+Technologies+in+Multicultural+Learning+Environments&amp;title=European+Conference+on+e-Learning&amp;issn=20488637&amp;date=2014-10-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=36&amp;au=Arenas%2C+Edilson&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=European+Conference+on+e-Learning&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/";ProQuest Central,SciTech Premium Collection,Social Science Premium Collection
Meeting the Online Needs of Part Time Postgraduate Engineering Students;"  This research paper investigates how online resources and blended learning can meet the needs of part time adult learners studying or a post graduate qualification in Engineering. There are many reasons why students in industry undertake a postgraduate qualification in part time mode, namely:-They need the work to support themselves through further study Their company wants them to undertake continual and professional development They wish to become a Chartered Engineer ie a member of a professional body These reasons are very commendable and these student set off with a view to completion with an air of optimism and excitement. However, a combination of work /life demands and the rigors of academia can quickly take the shine off the optimism. As full time employed adult learners, there are many obstacles that will interfere with their academic life, for example employer demands ie having to go overseas to work or an urgent need to be at work, family demands ie a new baby or caring for a family member, other demands include jury service. Therefore one of the main design criteria for these type of Post graduate courses was to improve the flexibility of delivery and to generate as many different types of support for these students as possible. An adult learner will more likely seize the opportunity to learn, even in the face of adversity. Self-regulation means that they will seek help if they lack understanding, they also believe more in their own capabilities and are probably more organised, (Boekaerts, Pintrich, &amp; Zeidner, 2000; Schunk &amp; Zimmerman, 1998). This is contradictory to Prensky (2001) who developed the title ""Digital Immigrants"" for adult learners as opposed to ""Digital Natives"" for the younger learner. Many other papers show that what the adult learner lacks in online skills he makes up in terms of resilience, experience and organisation.Therefore, this paper examines how online resource, tools and delivery methods were part of the course design in order to overcome some of the difficulties that these adult learners encountered.";1680486170;Conference Papers & Proceedings;;"Wilkinson, Stephen;Folley, Duncan";;; Copyright Academic Conferences International Limited Oct 2014;; Feature;; Oct 2014;;2048-8637;; English; English; 589-598; Kidmore End;Oct 2014;European Conference on e-Learning;2014;;https://search.proquest.com/docview/1680486170?accountid=11774;;;;;; 589;; Adult learning , Adult students , Engineering , Social interaction , Communication , Distance learning , Learning management systems , Web 2.0;;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aeducation&amp;atitle=Meeting+the+Online+Needs+of+Part+Time+Postgraduate+Engineering+Students&amp;title=European+Conference+on+e-Learning&amp;issn=20488637&amp;date=2014-10-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=589&amp;au=Wilkinson%2C+Stephen%3BFolley%2C+Duncan&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=European+Conference+on+e-Learning&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/";ProQuest Central,SciTech Premium Collection,Social Science Premium Collection
Gamification of Midterm Examinations Using a Dynamic 3D Multiuser Game: What's the Impact?;"  This study investigates the efficiency of using a dynamic 3D multiuser game as a midterm evaluation tool that replaces the traditional paper-based examination procedure. The participants of the study were 89 students in tertiary education consisting of 73 male students and 16 female students and their ages ranged from 18 to 20. The intervention lasted 5 weeks and took place in the context of a computer science course in collaboration with a professor. The research design that was implemented in this study was based on the ""One-Shot"" model. The game that was used as a treatment belonged to the category of the treasure hunt quiz games. The game was dynamic and therefore the educator was able to customize parameters and content using an administration panel. The goal of the game for students was to find hidden objects that contain multiple choice questions and then answer them correctly. The results from the data analysis showed that there was a statistically significant correlation between the performance of the students on the game and their performance on the final paper-based examination.";1674172817;Conference Papers & Proceedings;;"Mavridis, Apostolos;Tsiatsos, Thrasyvoulos;Chatzakis, Michalis;Kitsikoudis, Konstantinos;Lazarou, Efthymios";;; Copyright Academic Conferences International Limited Oct 2014;; Feature;; Oct 2014;;2049-0992;; English; English; 372-379; Reading;Oct 2014;European Conference on Games Based Learning;2014;1;https://search.proquest.com/docview/1674172817?accountid=11774;;; Tables , References , Graphs , Illustrations;;; 372;; Studies , Education , Games , Cooperative learning , Interactive learning , Collaboration , Gamification , Collaborative learning;;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Ahightechjournals&amp;atitle=Gamification+of+Midterm+Examinations+Using+a+Dynamic+3D+Multiuser+Game%3A+What%27s+the+Impact%3F&amp;title=European+Conference+on+Games+Based+Learning&amp;issn=20490992&amp;date=2014-10-01&amp;volume=1&amp;issue=&amp;spage=372&amp;au=Mavridis%2C+Apostolos%3BTsiatsos%2C+Thrasyvoulos%3BChatzakis%2C+Michalis%3BKitsikoudis%2C+Konstantinos%3BLazarou%2C+Efthymios&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=European+Conference+on+Games+Based+Learning&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/";ProQuest Central,SciTech Premium Collection
Blogging in the Classroom: Using WordPress Blogs with BuddyPress Plugin as a Learning Tool;  In an effort to speak the social media language of our students, better prepare them for today 's advertising jobs and seek the helpful learning aspects of social media, three professors used WordPress blogs with 130 students one semester in three different advertising courses. Descriptions of how blogs were used to enhance student participation, engagement and skill building are included along with students' quantitative and qualitative assessments. The use of course blogs led to multiple positive self reported student learning outcomes. Based on the researchers' self-evaluation and analysis of students' survey feedback, and research into the current advertising and teaching environment, this article offers insights for using blogging to provide added benefits to advertising courses including improving the learning environment and increasing student skill development.;1645350535;Scholarly Journals;;"Quesenberry, Keith A;Saewitz, Dana;Kantrowitz, Sheryl";;; Copyright Association for Education in Journalism and Mass Communication Advertising Division Fall 2014;; Feature;; Fall 2014;;1098-0482;2; English;; 5-17,4; Columbia;Fall 2014;Journal of Advertising Education;2014;18;https://search.proquest.com/docview/1645350535?accountid=11774;;; References , Photographs , Tables;;; 5;; Colleges & universities , Social networks , Distance learning , College students , Advertising , Blogs , United States--US;;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aabiglobal&amp;atitle=Blogging+in+the+Classroom%3A+Using+WordPress+Blogs+with+BuddyPress+Plugin+as+a+Learning+Tool&amp;title=Journal+of+Advertising+Education&amp;issn=10980482&amp;date=2014-10-01&amp;volume=18&amp;issue=2&amp;spage=5&amp;au=Quesenberry%2C+Keith+A%3BSaewitz%2C+Dana%3BKantrowitz%2C+Sheryl&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=Journal+of+Advertising+Education&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/";ProQuest Central,Social Science Premium Collection
Designing a Mobile and Socially Networked Learning Assistant for a University-level Keyword Advertising Course;  An Internet-based learning assistant leveraging the social attribute features of mobile technology is designed and implemented to incorporate updating course content of an upper-level college technology advertising course in real-time. The mobile application offers an online collaborative environment utilizing the inherent social and location-independent features of mobile technology to improve the teaching and learning environment. The application was implemented in a university-level keyword advertising course and integrated with several course-related web tools, including an enterprise-level social network. Aspects of the effectiveness of the application were evaluated using a series of five hypotheses. The results supported three hypotheses testing the relationship between gender and application use, the variations among tool choices, and the identification of frequently used tools. The two hypotheses not supported were the preference of the mobile application and the use of the social network software as standalone services, as most students desired that the social network service be integrated with an existing, university-level, content management system. Research results indicate that the integration of a mobile application with an existing content management system would be beneficial for increased student engagement with course content, which the university has since implemented.;1650489050;Scholarly Journals;;"Mukherjee, Partha;Kozlek, Brad;Jansen, Bernard J;Gyorke, Allan;Camplese, Cole W";;; Copyright Multimedia Educational Resource for Learning and Online Teaching (MERLOT) Sep 2014;; Journal Article;; Sep 2014;;;3; English; English; n/a;  Long Beach;Sep 2014;Journal of Online Learning and Teaching;2014;10;https://search.proquest.com/docview/1650489050?accountid=11774;;;;;; 351;; Internet , Social networks , Distance learning , Colleges & universities , Advertising , Keywords; mobile technology , learning assistant , collaborative environment , social network , hypothesis testing;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aeducation&amp;atitle=Designing+a+Mobile+and+Socially+Networked+Learning+Assistant+for+a+University-level+Keyword+Advertising+Course&amp;title=Journal+of+Online+Learning+and+Teaching&amp;issn=&amp;date=2014-09-01&amp;volume=10&amp;issue=3&amp;spage=351&amp;au=Mukherjee%2C+Partha%3BKozlek%2C+Brad%3BJansen%2C+Bernard+J%3BGyorke%2C+Allan%3BCamplese%2C+Cole+W&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=Journal+of+Online+Learning+and+Teaching&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/";ProQuest Central,Social Science Premium Collection
Motivating students' participation in a computer networks course by means of magic, drama and games;  The recent economic crisis has forced many universities to cut down expenses by packing students into large lecture groups. The problem with large auditoria is that they discourage dialogue between students and faculty and they burden participation. Adding to this, students in computer science courses usually find the field to be full of theoretical and technical concepts. Lack of understanding leads them to lose interest and / or motivation. Classroom experience shows that the lecturer could employ alternative teaching methods, especially for early-year undergraduate students, in order to grasp their interest and introduce basic concepts. This paper describes some of the approaches that may be used to keep students interested and make them feel comfortable as they comprehend basic concepts in computer networks. The lecturing procedure was enriched with games, magic tricks and dramatic representations. This approach was used experimentally for two semesters and the results were more than encouraging.;1866138075;Scholarly Journals;;"Hilas, Constantinos S;Politis, Anastasios";;; SpringerPlus is a copyright of Springer, 2014.; 10.1186/2193-1801-3-362; Journal Article;; Jul 2014;;;1; English; English; 1-12; Heidelberg;Jul 2014;SpringerPlus;2014;3;https://search.proquest.com/docview/1866138075?accountid=11774;;;;;; 1;;; Lecture improvements , Teaching approaches , Engineering education , Computer networking course;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aagriculturejournals&amp;atitle=Motivating+students%27+participation+in+a+computer+networks+course+by+means+of+magic%2C+drama+and+games&amp;title=SpringerPlus&amp;issn=&amp;date=2014-07-01&amp;volume=3&amp;issue=1&amp;spage=1&amp;au=Hilas%2C+Constantinos+S%3BPolitis%2C+Anastasios&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=SpringerPlus&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/10.1186%2F2193-1801-3-362";ProQuest Central,SciTech Premium Collection

Design and development issues for educational robotics training camps;  The aim of this study is to explore critical design issues for educational robotics training camps and to describe how these factors should be implemented in the development of such camps. For this purpose, two robotics training camps were organized for elementary school students. The first camp had 30 children attendees, and the second had 22. As a research methodology, a multiple-case design approach was used. Interviews with children and instructors, observations, field notes, and camp evaluation forms were used as data collection methods. The data were analyzed by qualitative data analysis techniques and categorized into themes: instruction, group issues, competition, coaching, technical issues, challenges, and camp duration. Prominent findings indicate that instruction strategies for a robotics camp should be designed from simple to complex. The most effective and enjoyable part of the camps were the project studies, which should be highly encouraged. Robotics training camps should provide children a chance to practice what they have learned in school. Group size should allow for every child in the group to have tasks assigned at all times.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT];1520871072;Scholarly Journals;;"Ucgul, Memet;Cagiltay, Kursat";;; Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht 2014; 10.1007/s10798-013-9253-9; Feature;; May 2014;;0957-7572;2; English; English; 203-222; Dordrecht;May 2014;International Journal of Technology and Design Education;2014;24;https://search.proquest.com/docview/1520871072?accountid=11774;;; References;;; 203;; Technology education , Curricula , Robots , Camps;;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aeducation&amp;atitle=Design+and+development+issues+for+educational+robotics+training+camps&amp;title=International+Journal+of+Technology+and+Design+Education&amp;issn=09577572&amp;date=2014-05-01&amp;volume=24&amp;issue=2&amp;spage=203&amp;au=Ucgul%2C+Memet%3BCagiltay%2C+Kursat&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=International+Journal+of+Technology+and+Design+Education&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/10.1007%2Fs10798-013-9253-9";Art, Design & Architecture Collection,ProQuest Central,SciTech Premium Collection,Social Science Premium Collection

Pair Programming: Under What Conditions Is It Advantageous for Middle School Students?;  Pair programming is a strategy that grew out of industry and has shown promise for performance and retention in computer programming courses at universities and in industry. In this study, we examine whether pair programming is effective in K-12, what it is effective for, and how partners influence each other. We collected the data from 320 middle school students working alone or with a partner on a game programming task. Compared to working alone, pair programming was advantageous for computational thinking and for building programming knowledge, particularly among less experienced students. Students' initial computer experience and attitude toward collaboration influenced their partners. Those with more experience relative to their partner achieved greater computer confidence and more positive attitudes toward computing. When students had a more positive attitude toward collaboration (relative to their partner), their programming knowledge decreased. We discuss implications for pairing students and for future research.;1528148623;Scholarly Journals;;"Denner, Jill;Werner, Linda;Campe, Shannon;Ortiz, Eloy";;; Copyright International Society for Technology in Education Spring 2014;; Feature;; Spring 2014;;1539-1523;3; English; English; 277-296; Eugene;Spring 2014;Journal of Research on Technology in Education;2014;46;https://search.proquest.com/docview/1528148623?accountid=11774;;; Tables , References , Photographs;;; 277;; Middle schools , Studies , Attitudes , Middle school students , Computer programming;;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aeducation&amp;atitle=Pair+Programming%3A+Under+What+Conditions+Is+It+Advantageous+for+Middle+School+Students%3F&amp;title=Journal+of+Research+on+Technology+in+Education&amp;issn=15391523&amp;date=2014-04-01&amp;volume=46&amp;issue=3&amp;spage=277&amp;au=Denner%2C+Jill%3BWerner%2C+Linda%3BCampe%2C+Shannon%3BOrtiz%2C+Eloy&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=Journal+of+Research+on+Technology+in+Education&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/";ProQuest Central,Social Science Premium Collection
Extending the SOLO Model for Software-Based Projects;  In the process of assessing learning outcomes, educators use constructive tools for evaluating students' understanding and performance. In the present study MIS students were engaged in a full life cycle project as part of a Software Analysis and Design workshop. For evaluating their performance, we used the SOLO (Structure of the Observed Learning Outcomes) taxonomy. However during the various stages of the workshop we encountered some inherent limitations of the taxonomy that led us to the understanding that the SOLO taxonomy should be enhanced. This paper elaborates on these missing but required enhancements.;1627736019;Scholarly Journals;;"Lavy, Ilana;Yadin, Aharon";;; Copyright Modern Education and Computer Science Press Mar 2014; 10.5815/ijmecs.2014.03.01; Journal Article;; Mar 2014;;2075-0161;3; English; English; 1-10; Hong Kong;Mar 2014;International Journal of Modern Education and Computer Science;2014;6;https://search.proquest.com/docview/1627736019?accountid=11774;;;;;; 1;; Models , Educational software , Performance evaluation; Higher education , peer assessment , the SOLO taxonomy , student perceptions , student performance;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aeducation&amp;atitle=Extending+the+SOLO+Model+for+Software-Based+Projects&amp;title=International+Journal+of+Modern+Education+and+Computer+Science&amp;issn=20750161&amp;date=2014-03-01&amp;volume=6&amp;issue=3&amp;spage=1&amp;au=Lavy%2C+Ilana%3BYadin%2C+Aharon&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=International+Journal+of+Modern+Education+and+Computer+Science&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/10.5815%2Fijmecs.2014.03.01";ProQuest Central,SciTech Premium Collection,Social Science Premium Collection
Student perspectives on self-directed learning;Undergraduate student perspectives regarding specific factors associated with self-directed learning were collected through eight focus groups. A total of 80 upperclassmen provided input revealing three emergent themes in the focus groups responses: (1) Student-Controlled, (2) Faculty-Controlled, and (3) Administration-Controlled Facilitators and Barriers to promoting self-directed learning. Students acknowledged much of their learning was within their control. However, they did note that faculty and administrators have a significant impact on their desire and ability to learn. In an effort to empower students to direct their own learning processes the results of this study have been integrated into campus assessment initiatives including the development of a student organization to provide a consistent, student-led forum for students to voice their opinions and concerns about their learning processes and assessment.;2387858313;Scholarly Journals;;"Douglass, Carolinda;Morris, Sherrill R";;; © 2014.

Real-World Assessment as an Integral Component of an Undergraduate Science Communication Program;"This paper discusses Australia’s oldest and largest undergraduate science communication program: that offered at the Centre for the Public Awareness of Science at the Australian National University. We outline the history of the program, and explain the pedagogy that drove its development. In particular, we address the assessment of student learning, which focuses on ‘real-world’ tasks. The four main assessment approaches discussed are 1) online blogs and opinion pieces; 2) a student conference, 3) research publication, and 4) work-integrated learning. These assessment approaches specifically target skills required by graduates to achieve both within the university and professionally. The different approaches require students to employ diverse communication techniques and strategies appropriate to their chosen audience. Students also gain practical experience outside of the university context, allowing them to recognise the relevance of their studies within an industry, private or government environment. Although these assessment practices are embedded in a specific science communication curriculum, we suggest that they can be incorporated within any science discipline major.";2248367699;Scholarly Journals;;"McKinnon, Merryn C;Orthia, Lindy A;Grant, Will J;Lamberts, Rod";;; © 2014.

Learning objects to improve cognitive understanding in learning introductory programming;Learning programming is difficult for novices. Various kinds of learning tools and approaches have been adapted to scaffold programming learning, and they are selected to suit the nature of the programming learning setting. In the past, courses entailed a large volume of learning materials and/or learning tools to support the process of learning. The design and development of educational material has changed dramatically from being a course to smaller pieces of content. The smaller pieces of content are known as learning object. The idea of breaking content into smaller chunks of information is a new way of content creation which is just right and is the lowest possible size that accomplishes a single learning outcome. The prevailing focus on the use of learning object in a lab setting is promising to promote better programming understanding for novices.;1757741536;Dissertations & Theses;;Matthews, Reginamary;;;" Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.";; Dissertation/Thesis;; 2014; 978-1-339-35647-1;;; English; English;;;2014;ProQuest Dissertations and Theses;2014;;https://search.proquest.com/docview/1757741536?accountid=11774; 0515 Education , 0530 Teacher education , 0710 Educational technology; 0515 Education , 0530 Teacher education , 0710 Educational technology;; 0515 Education , 0530 Teacher education , 0710 Educational technology;;; 0515 Education , 0530 Teacher education , 0710 Educational technology; Education , Teacher education , Educational technology; Education , Learning objects , Learning programming , Multimedia learning , Programming , Project method in teaching , Teaching and learning;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:Education+Database&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Learning+objects+to+improve+cognitive+understanding+in+learning+introductory+programming&amp;issn=&amp;date=2014-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Matthews%2C+Reginamary&amp;isbn=978-1-339-35647-1&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/";ProQuest Central,Social Science Premium Collection
The Danielson Framework of Teaching: A particpatory action research study;The purpose of the qualitative participatory action research study was to evaluate how the Danielson Framework of Teaching displays constructivist views in its domains, promote educator growth, involve teachers in the evaluative process and engage students to increase achievement. The participatory action research study included 20 teachers from kindergarten through eighth grade within a school in Michigan. The responses were evaluated according to the manual qualitative content analysis approach. There were six themes in the data that revealed commonalities and varieties among the participants. Theme 1 reveals that teacher’s lessons are aligned with the Framework by being student-centered, engaging students, and using the state standards as a guide. Theme 2 reveals that Teachscape videos help educators enhance their practices by viewing themselves and reflecting on their existing practices. Theme 3 reveals that Teachscape videos are a resource used to develop educator’s instruction by promoting reflection on the strategies they implement, provide a visual of the Framework, and provide examples for lesson implementation. Theme 4 reveals that the Framework engages students in the learning process to increase achievement through student-centered environments, lesson planning, and student-led lessons. Theme 5 reveals stakeholders align the evaluation process with achievement through monitoring instruction and student achievement scores. Theme 6 reveals that school districts involve teachers in the evaluation process by requiring reflection with their practices and students’ achievement scores. Administrative teams could incorporate the Framework to assist teachers in promoting constructivist views of learning and allowing students to have more responsibility over their learning.;1687190079;Dissertations & Theses;;Owens, Schequita S.;;;" Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.";; Dissertation/Thesis;; 2014; 978-1-321-82067-6;;; English; English;;;2014;ProQuest Dissertations and Theses;2014;;https://search.proquest.com/docview/1687190079?accountid=11774; 0443 Educational evaluation , 0449 Educational leadership , 0530 Teacher education; 0443 Educational evaluation , 0449 Educational leadership , 0530 Teacher education;; 0443 Educational evaluation , 0449 Educational leadership , 0530 Teacher education;;; 0443 Educational evaluation , 0449 Educational leadership , 0530 Teacher education; Educational evaluation , Educational leadership , Teacher education; Education , Action research , Constructivis learning theory , Danielson framework of teaching , Educational leadership , Professional development , Teacher evaluation;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:Education+Database&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+Danielson+Framework+of+Teaching%3A+A+particpatory+action+research+study&amp;issn=&amp;date=2014-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Owens%2C+Schequita+S.&amp;isbn=978-1-321-82067-6&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/";ProQuest Central,Social Science Premium Collection
Graduate students' motivation to teach plant sciences to K-12 audiences;"Graduate students' motivation to share their knowledge and research with K-12 audiences as future scientists is informed by their beliefs and perceived value of science literacy outreach. Graduate training programs in academia integrate outreach teaching components to equip future scientists with a variety of communication skills, which may reflect either a transmission of knowledge to the learner or through engagement with the learner. As such, the education component of the ""Partnership for Research and Education in Plant Breeding and Genetics"" grant sought to train graduate plant science students ( N = 17) to disseminate their research to K-12 audiences. Graduate students participated in outreach teacher training using Learner-Centered Teaching (LCT) strategies to develop and conduct two science lessons for K-12 audiences in a non-formal and formal educational settings. The purpose of this mixed methods study was to describe the outreach teaching beliefs and values of plant science graduate students after receiving the outreach training. The researcher used a deductive approach to analyze and triangulate multiple data sources, including teaching self-efficacy questionnaires, LCT knowledge tests, reflection essays, and semi-structured interviews. The research study was conceptualized into three phases (i.e., course instruction and teaching experiences; follow-up questionnaire and interviews; triangulation) of a multistrand design and resulted in three major conclusions. First, plant science graduate students valued learning how to engage with K-12 audiences using active learning. Graduate students' expressed values of the following qualities: (a) how learners can apply knowledge to emerging agricultural issues, (b) how professors (i.e., graduate students as teachers) coach and facilitate, intertwining teaching and assessing, and (c) how to engage with learners actively by providing useful and timely feedback. Second, graduate students described field-based teaching experiences within formal and non-formal educational settings that helped them practice communication skills and develop their teaching self-efficacy. In this study, graduate students valued the following elements of a field-based experience: (a) participation in planning the experience, (b) selection of the learners by age and grade level demographics, and (c) multiple visits to teach the selected group of students. And third, graduate students described an enjoyment of teaching K-12 audiences and the K-12 experience was useful in preparing them to communicate science to technical and non-technical audiences. Graduate students' reflections of enjoyment were referenced with recognition to the sense of autonomy that the graduate students achieved throughout their learning experiences. Moreover, graduate students recognized the transferability of the knowledge and skills from the integrated learning experience for their academic and career endeavors. As graduate-level academic programs continue to adjust and adapt to prepare plant science graduate students to meet the needs of an ever changing society, the following implications are discussed: acquiring (LCT) teaching skills to communicate science literacy, benefits of K-12 audience field-based experiences, the opportunity to use a constructivist approach to assist learners in facilitating science outreach and implications for policy.";1686828058;Dissertations & Theses;;Welsh, Melissa Leiden;;;" Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.";; Dissertation/Thesis;; 2014; 978-1-321-74402-6;;; English; English;;;2014;ProQuest Dissertations and Theses;2014;;https://search.proquest.com/docview/1686828058?accountid=11774; 0479 Plant sciences , 0517 Agricultural education , 0745 Higher education; 0479 Plant sciences , 0517 Agricultural education , 0745 Higher education;; 0479 Plant sciences , 0517 Agricultural education , 0745 Higher education;;; 0479 Plant sciences , 0517 Agricultural education , 0745 Higher education; Plant sciences , Agricultural education , Higher education; Biological sciences , Education , Expectancy value motivation , Graduate students , Learner-centered teaching , Motivation , Plant science outreach , Teaching self-efficacy;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:Agricultural+%26+Environmental+Science+Dissertations&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Graduate+students%27+motivation+to+teach+plant+sciences+to+K-12+audiences&amp;issn=&amp;date=2014-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Welsh%2C+Melissa+Leiden&amp;isbn=978-1-321-74402-6&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/";SciTech Premium Collection
Analyzing change in community college pre-statistics developmental mathematics curriculum;"Community colleges serve as an open door and a critical access point to higher education for millions of students across our nation. In California alone, over two million students are enrolled across over one hundred community colleges (Sengupta &amp; Jepsen, 2006), open access institutions with no entry requirements. A large majority of students beginning their educational path at a community college are placed into a remedial mathematics sequence that few will ever finish (Bailey, Jeong, &amp; Cho, 2010a). These remedial pathways were designed to replicate the usual sequence of high school algebra courses (Brint &amp; Karabel, 1989; Tucker, 2013), yet research demonstrates that these courses require algebraic skills beyond what is needed for success in most non-calculus-track transferable courses (NCEE, 2013). The result is that millions of community college students are being filtered out of their educational programs because of their inability to master algebra skills that they will not need in either future coursework or in their chosen careers. Researchers with the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement for Teaching developed a new approach called Statway designed to address this concern. The two-term program begins with students who assess into elementary algebra, focusing on statistical concepts while utilizing a just-in-time approach in which algebraic skills are introduced as needed, providing context and relevance for students. By the conclusion of the second term of the program, students have learned the content of typical freshman statistics as well as developed sufficient algebra skills to succeed in that material. Introduced via training hosted by Carnegie and reinforced by an ongoing community of practice, alternative pedagogy is employed to maximize student engagement and success. The purpose of this project was to study three community colleges that have adopted the Statway program and seek to understand the underlying conditions and processes by which they were able to do so. Further, the project examined the alignment between the colleges' processes and models of change theory discussed in the literature. Lastly, I examined how data was utilized in the adoption process and thereafter. The study utilized a qualitative case study approach based on transcripts from nineteen interviews and documents gathered at each of the three institutions visited. Transcripts and documents were coded by themes and analyzed using software. Conclusions were based on the most prominent and consistent themes identified across institutions. Findings included (a) the departments that adopted the program were supportive of experimentation, (b) at each institution a faculty champion was instrumental in carrying the program forward to implementation, (c) the departments did not deliberately follow models of change theory from the literature, but their processes aligned well with the models, (d) because I studied pilot programs, only national data was utilized initially, and (e) there was a relationship between the difficulty of the adoption process and the department's decision-making approach along the individualist-collectivist spectrum. Results of this study provide insight into ways mathematics departments approached and carried out significant curriculum change, insight into departmental characteristics most conducive to change, and recommendations gleaned from interviews as to how to maximize transferability and viability of alternative mathematics programs such as Statway.";1665572091;Dissertations & Theses;;Sanders, Brian Kenneth;;;" Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.";; Dissertation/Thesis;; 2014; 978-1-321-60982-0;;; English; English;;;2014;ProQuest Dissertations and Theses;2014;;https://search.proquest.com/docview/1665572091?accountid=11774; 0275 Community college education , 0280 Mathematics education , 0449 Educational leadership , 0727 Curriculum development; 0275 Community college education , 0280 Mathematics education , 0449 Educational leadership , 0727 Curriculum development;; 0275 Community college education , 0280 Mathematics education , 0449 Educational leadership , 0727 Curriculum development;;; 0275 Community college education , 0280 Mathematics education , 0449 Educational leadership , 0727 Curriculum development; Community college education , Mathematics education , Educational leadership , Curriculum development; Education , Change theory , Curriculum reform , Data-based decision , Developmental mathematics , Individualist-collectivist , Remedial mathematics;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:Education+Database&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Analyzing+change+in+community+college+pre-statistics+developmental+mathematics+curriculum&amp;issn=&amp;date=2014-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Sanders%2C+Brian+Kenneth&amp;isbn=978-1-321-60982-0&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/";ProQuest Central,Social Science Premium Collection
Student Designed Science Games: A Study of the Design Process, Artifacts, and Attitudes in a Constructivist and Constructionist Learning Environment;Video games as pedagogy is an interest to the educational research community, both in creating games for learning and for learning through creating games. This research study takes the latter approach, putting students in charge of creating their own video games based on science topics with which they were previously unfamiliar. It provided the opportunity for students to learn about and explore their understanding of the topics while designing their games. Students worked closely with a scientist from the Federation of American Scientists (FAS), who also had experience in the design of educational science games. The purpose of this study was to follow the design process students undertook when placed in a constructivist and constructionist learning environment with available tools and support to complete their games. This study furthermore examined student attitudes towards science and technology (specifically, making video games) after participation in the game design workshop. Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) skills are predicted to be necessary for a technologically-oriented future with an increasingly competitive global market. Engaging students in STEM activities can encourage them towards these fields. Thus, programs such as the game design workshop in this study grant the opportunity to stimulate student interest. A mixed methods approach was used in this study, applying both qualitative and quantitative analysis on the data. Qualitative findings highlight student strategies during the design process, including modeling their games on video games with which they were already familiar, gathering information through design journals, web queries, and discussions with a science expert, and working collaboratively. The study also found that student understanding of the science topic began to take shape and evolve as their game designs evolved, and that the game design process helped students articulate this understanding of the topic. Quantitative analysis on surveys did not show any statistical significance on improvement of science attitudes. With regards to attitudes towards making video games, students did show an improvement with statistical significance regarding their perceived ability at making video games.;1651237361;Dissertations & Theses;;Khalili, Neda;;;" Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.";; Dissertation/Thesis;; 2014; 978-1-321-48891-3;;; English; English;;;2014;ProQuest Dissertations and Theses;2014;;https://search.proquest.com/docview/1651237361?accountid=11774; 0710 Educational technology , 0984 Computer science; 0710 Educational technology , 0984 Computer science;; 0710 Educational technology , 0984 Computer science;;; 0710 Educational technology , 0984 Computer science; Educational technology , Computer science; Applied sciences , Education , Constructionism , Design , Game makers , Science curriculum , Video games;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:Education+Database&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Student+Designed+Science+Games%3A+A+Study+of+the+Design+Process%2C+Artifacts%2C+and+Attitudes+in+a+Constructivist+and+Constructionist+Learning+Environment&amp;issn=&amp;date=2014-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Khalili%2C+Neda&amp;isbn=978-1-321-48891-3&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/";ProQuest Central,Social Science Premium Collection
Educating Naval Engineers in Occupational Safety, Health, and Environmental Sustainability;This study's author replicated a Spanish study conducted by Cortés, Pellicer, and Catalá, who explored engineering undergraduate students being educated in occupational risk prevention as part of their total college education. The problem is that U.S. naval engineers in Washington, D.C. are not being educated in occupational risk prevention. This lack of training is hampering naval engineer's capabilities and technical acumen to prevent accidents in their designs. The purpose of this qualitative Delphi method study with thematic analysis was to explore with a panel of experts what additional education U.S. naval engineers' need in occupational risk prevention. This study's researcher explored how to integrate occupational risk prevention into current curriculum, to improve engineers' skills to prevent occupational accidents. The Delphi method allowed a procedure to follow that the experts could reach a consensus. Professors and practicing naval engineers participated in the panel to explore what kind of mandatory courses in occupational safety, health, and environmental sustainment should be a part of the required engineering curriculum for naval engineers. Utilized for this study, the questionnaire delivery system, Survey Monkey ® , solicited inputs from engineering professors and naval engineers. The data garnered and the results indicated that naval engineers need training in occupational safety, health, and environmental sustainment. Stakeholders could use the results from this study to improve the education of naval engineers in the area of occupational risk prevention. This study should inspire further research and action to improve the education of both naval engineers and other engineers to the benefit of society. Major themes included all forms of safety issues, health, environment, curriculum, and different forms of training, costs, and timing. Subthemes included risk, hazards, blended learning, variety of mandatory subjects, and financial aspects. The conclusions and recommendations from this study indicate that naval engineers need to be educated in specific occupational risk prevention matters at all educational levels and for practicing naval engineers to use blended learning techniques. The practical implications from this study are that naval engineers need specific training in occupational safety, health, and environmental sustainment subjects to safeguard human life and protect the environment for future generations.;1648175298;Dissertations & Theses;;Stevenson, David R.;;;" Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.";; Dissertation/Thesis;; 2014; 978-1-321-43507-8;;; English; English;;;2014;ProQuest Dissertations and Theses;2014;;https://search.proquest.com/docview/1648175298?accountid=11774; 0354 Occupational health , 0442 Environmental education , 0468 Naval engineering; 0354 Occupational health , 0442 Environmental education , 0468 Naval engineering;; 0354 Occupational health , 0442 Environmental education , 0468 Naval engineering;;; 0354 Occupational health , 0442 Environmental education , 0468 Naval engineering; Occupational health , Environmental education , Naval engineering; Applied sciences , Health and environmental sciences , Education , Education , Engineers , Health , Navy , Safety , Sustainability;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:Public+Health+Database&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Educating+Naval+Engineers+in+Occupational+Safety%2C+Health%2C+and+Environmental+Sustainability&amp;issn=&amp;date=2014-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Stevenson%2C+David+R.&amp;isbn=978-1-321-43507-8&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/";ProQuest Central
I Demand. . . Sorry, I Apologize: Power, Collaboration, and Technology in the Social Construction of Leadership across Diversity;This transformative case study used qualitative and quantitative methods to explore the social construction of collaborative and technology leadership among students in a graduate-level course on curriculum leadership. Analysis of interactions among students during an asynchronous computer-supported collaborative learning (CSCL) project using critical discourse analysis was completed. Student dialogue was analyzed for how students across different social groups interacted discursively to promote and inhibit the development of leadership in the domains of collaboration and technology, while socially constructing the knowledge context for learning about the societal curriculum for diverse social groups. Findings were that women more than men were verbose and promotive, and that much of their power/language exchanges involved mutual understanding. Black students were underrepresented in the graduate course, but gained power through language and course design. Latino students lacked self-advocacy and emphasized cultural diversity in their use of power/language. An interview with the professor provides insight into the structures that frame student's experiences. These findings are discussed through a three-tiered Critical Discourse Analysis Framework and recommendations are made for educators, leaders and education leadership preparation programs that use on-line learning platforms that support collaborative learning experiences.;1645427977;Dissertations & Theses;;Jones, Heather Sadler;;;" Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.";; Dissertation/Thesis;; 2014; 978-1-321-41593-3;;; English; English;;;2014;ProQuest Dissertations and Theses;2014;;https://search.proquest.com/docview/1645427977?accountid=11774; 0449 Educational leadership , 0710 Educational technology; 0449 Educational leadership , 0710 Educational technology;; 0449 Educational leadership , 0710 Educational technology;;; 0449 Educational leadership , 0710 Educational technology; Educational leadership , Educational technology; Education , Collaboration , Critical discourse analysis , Critical theory , Virtual;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:Education+Database&amp;atitle=&amp;title=I+Demand.+.+.+Sorry%2C+I+Apologize%3A+Power%2C+Collaboration%2C+and+Technology+in+the+Social+Construction+of+Leadership+across+Diversity&amp;issn=&amp;date=2014-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Jones%2C+Heather+Sadler&amp;isbn=978-1-321-41593-3&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/";ProQuest Central,Social Science Premium Collection
An analysis of the differences in ELA, math, and science student achievement among elementary students based on teacher preparation models: A quantitative study;The purpose of this quantitative study was to determine the effectiveness of the Teacher Advancement Program (TAP) system on increasing elementary student achievement in ELA, math, and science when compared to a traditional professional development program. The TAP program is an on-going, job-embedded professional development program that provides weekly professional development with support in the classroom from mentor and master teachers. The theoretical context of this study included the principles of Malcolm Knowles' adult learning theory and Jean Piaget's constructivist theory. The primary research question of this study asked: Is there a statistically significant difference between the mean PASS scores of elementary students attending classes of teachers in a TAP teacher preparation program and the mean PASS scores of elementary students attending classes of teachers in a traditional teacher preparation program? A descriptive comparative research design was chosen to effectively analyze differences between groups. This study employed six independent samples t tests to analyze archival data to compare the differences in ELA, math, and science mean test scores of elementary students based on teacher preparation programs (TAP program versus traditional) to determine if there was a statistically significant difference between the two groups. The Mann-Whitney U test was employed to confirm the results of the independent samples t tests. This quantitative study reviewed the 2012 South Carolina Palmetto Assessment of State Standards (PASS) student test scores of all ELA, math, and science regular education teachers in Grades 3 through 8. The sample for this study consisted of 124 third through eighth grade ELA, math, and science teachers of a small, rural school district. The results indicated there was a statistically significant difference (p=.05) in the mean test scores between teachers in the TAP and traditional teacher preparation programs. The findings uncovered in this study suggested the TAP program was less effective than a traditional program in increasing elementary student achievement. Results of this study justify the need for instructional leaders to pilot teacher preparation programs prior to full adoption. Further research in a variety of settings and study parameters is needed to determine the effectiveness of the TAP teacher preparation program.;1640903739;Dissertations & Theses;;Clark, Cherya;;;" Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.";; Dissertation/Thesis;; 2014; 978-1-321-39103-9;;; English; English;;;2014;ProQuest Dissertations and Theses;2014;;https://search.proquest.com/docview/1640903739?accountid=11774; 0443 Educational evaluation , 0524 Elementary education , 0530 Teacher education; 0443 Educational evaluation , 0524 Elementary education , 0530 Teacher education;; 0443 Educational evaluation , 0524 Elementary education , 0530 Teacher education;;; 0443 Educational evaluation , 0524 Elementary education , 0530 Teacher education; Educational evaluation , Elementary education , Teacher education; Education , Adult learning theory , Constructivist theory , Professional development , Professional learning community , Student achievement , Tap professional development program;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:Education+Database&amp;atitle=&amp;title=An+analysis+of+the+differences+in+ELA%2C+math%2C+and+science+student+achievement+among+elementary+students+based+on+teacher+preparation+models%3A+A+quantitative+study&amp;issn=&amp;date=2014-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Clark%2C+Cherya&amp;isbn=978-1-321-39103-9&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/";ProQuest Central,Social Science Premium Collection
Accuracy and Reliability of Peer Assessment of Clinical Skills and Professional Behaviors Among Undergraduate Athletic Training Students;"Peer assessment is used by health care professionals as a way to share knowledge and evaluate the performance of colleagues. Peer assessment is used widely in medical education as a preparatory tool for students, but peer assessment research in athletic training education is lacking. Athletic trainers are healthcare providers with a similar skill-set to physicians, thus, athletic training education can benefit from the use of peer assessment. Athletic training educators need to research the use of peer assessment as an evaluation tool in order to better prepare students to practice as healthcare professionals. This study investigated the accuracy and reliability of undergraduate athletic training students in their ability to assess their peers. This quasi-experimental study used between-group and within-group designs to answer the research questions. Junior-level students, senior-level students, and their instructors were enrolled as participants. Each student group’s ratings of clinical skills and professional behaviors were compared to instructor ratings to measure accuracy, and each student group’s ratings were compared for reliability. Cohen’s kappa coefficient measured inter-rater agreement for all statistical analyses. Both groups of students were accurate raters ( p &lt; .05) of their peers on clinical skills, but only the senior-level students were accurate in rating professional behaviors. Both groups of students were reliable in rating their peers on about half of the clinical skills. The senior-level students were also reliable in evaluating professional behaviors, but the junior-level students were not. The data for this study showed high levels of observed agreement for most clinical skills, subscales and the professional behaviors, but some items had low Cohen’s kappa values, most likely due to a known paradox that occurs with the kappa statistic. As the first study in athletic training education to use undergraduate students, live data collection, and rating of professional behaviors, the findings were promising for future research. Future research needs to include training in peer assessment, use of repeated measures, and comparison of instructor scores in order to better understand peer assessment in this population. Additionally, there is a need to establish consistent, quality measures in peer assessment research, including those used in athletic training education.";1639140931;Dissertations & Theses;;Engelmann, Jeanine M.;;;" Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.";; Dissertation/Thesis;; 2014; 978-1-321-36172-8;;; English; English;;;2014;ProQuest Dissertations and Theses;2014;;https://search.proquest.com/docview/1639140931?accountid=11774; 0443 Educational evaluation , 0575 Kinesiology , 0680 Health education; 0443 Educational evaluation , 0575 Kinesiology , 0680 Health education;; 0443 Educational evaluation , 0575 Kinesiology , 0680 Health education;;; 0443 Educational evaluation , 0575 Kinesiology , 0680 Health education; Educational evaluation , Kinesiology , Health education; Health and environmental sciences , Education , Athletic training students , Peer assessment , Professional behavior , Undergraduate;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:Education+Database&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Accuracy+and+Reliability+of+Peer+Assessment+of+Clinical+Skills+and+Professional+Behaviors+Among+Undergraduate+Athletic+Training+Students&amp;issn=&amp;date=2014-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Engelmann%2C+Jeanine+M.&amp;isbn=978-1-321-36172-8&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/";ProQuest Central,Social Science Premium Collection
Systematic Literature Reviews in Engineering Education and Other Developing Interdisciplinary Fields;  In fields such as medicine, psychology, and education, systematic reviews of the literature critically appraise and summarize research to inform policy and practice. We argue that now is an appropriate time in the development of the field of engineering education to both support systematic reviews and benefit from them. More reviews of prior work conducted more systematically would help advance the field by lowering the barrier for both researchers and practitioners to access the literature, enabling more objective critique of past efforts, identifying gaps, and proposing new directions for research. The purpose of this article is to introduce the methodology of systematic reviews to the field of engineering education and to adapt existing resources on systematic reviews to engineering education and other developing interdisciplinary fields. This article is primarily a narrative review of the literature on conducting systematic reviews. Methods are adapted to engineering education and similar developing interdisciplinary fields. To offer concrete, pertinent examples, we also conducted a systematic review of systematic review articles published on engineering education topics since 1990. Fourteen exemplars are presented in this article and used to illustrate systematic review procedures. Systematic reviews can benefit the field of engineering education by synthesizing prior work, by better informing practice, and by identifying important new directions for research. Engineering education researchers should consider including systematic reviews in their repertoire of methodologies.;1636192759;Scholarly Journals;;"Borrego, Maura;Foster, Margaret J;Froyd, Jeffrey E"; JEEDEQ;; Copyright Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

Dropping Out of Computer Science: A Phenomenological Study of Student Lived Experiences in Community College Computer Science;"California community colleges contribute alarmingly few computer science degree or certificate earners. While the literature shows clear K-12 impediments to CS matriculation in higher education, very little is known about the experiences of those who overcome initial impediments to CS yet do not persist through to program completion. This phenomenological study explores insights into that specific experience by interviewing underrepresented, low income, first-generation college students who began community college intending to transfer to 4-year institutions majoring in CS but switched to another field and remain enrolled or graduated. This study explores the lived experiences of students facing barriers, their avenues for developing interest in CS, and the persistence support systems they encountered, specifically looking at how students constructed their academic choice from these experiences. The growing diversity within California's population necessitates that experiences specific to underrepresented students be considered as part of this exploration. Ten semi-structured interviews and observations were conducted, transcribed and coded. Artifacts supporting student experiences were also collected. Data was analyzed through a social-constructivist lens to provide insight into experiences and how they can be navigated to create actionable strategies for community college computer science departments wishing to increase student success. Three major themes emerged from this research: (1) students shared pre-college characteristics; (2) faced similar challenges in college CS courses; and (3) shared similar reactions to the ""work"" of computer science. Results of the study included (1) CS interest development hinged on computer ownership in the home; (2) participants shared characteristics that were ideal for college success but not CS success; and (3) encounters in CS departments produced unique challenges for participants. Though CS interest was and remains abundant, opportunities for learning programming skills before college were non-existent and there were few opportunities in college to build skills or establish a peer support networks. Recommendations for institutional leaders and further research are also provided.";1629480156;Dissertations & Theses;;Gilbert-Valencia, Daniel H.;;;" Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.";; Dissertation/Thesis;; 2014; 978-1-321-28115-6;;; English; English;;;2014;ProQuest Dissertations and Theses;2014;;https://search.proquest.com/docview/1629480156?accountid=11774; 0275 Community college education , 0280 Mathematics education , 0340 Educational sociology , 0714 Science education; 0275 Community college education , 0280 Mathematics education , 0340 Educational sociology , 0714 Science education;; 0275 Community college education , 0280 Mathematics education , 0340 Educational sociology , 0714 Science education;;; 0275 Community college education , 0280 Mathematics education , 0340 Educational sociology , 0714 Science education; Community college education , Mathematics education , Educational sociology , Science education; Education , California , STEM fields , Science achievement , Student success , Underrepresented students;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:Education+Database&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Dropping+Out+of+Computer+Science%3A+A+Phenomenological+Study+of+Student+Lived+Experiences+in+Community+College+Computer+Science&amp;issn=&amp;date=2014-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Gilbert-Valencia%2C+Daniel+H.&amp;isbn=978-1-321-28115-6&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/";ProQuest Central,Social Science Premium Collection
Using Robots to Motivate At-Risk Learners in Science over the Ninth Grade Hurdle;"The ninth grade is a pivotal year in an adolescent's academic career; however, educators have failed to find a remedy for the high failure and dropout rates at this grade level. Students who lack basic skills and support as they enter high school can experience repeated failures, which often lead to a decrease in motivation and dropping out of school. Up to 15% of all ninth graders repeat ninth grade and 36% of all U. S. dropouts are ninth graders. It is imperative that researchers and educators find new ways to motivate at-risk students and augment basic skills in order to mitigate the dropout problem at this grade level. Robot teachers could be a viable solution to increase student motivation and achievement. However, before such strategies could be recommended for implementation, information about their efficacy in a high school setting is needed. The purpose of this quantitative, two-group experimental, pretest-posttest study was to determine the effects of a robot teacher/instructor on science motivation and science achievement in ninth grade at-risk learners. Approximately 40 at-risk, repeating ninth graders, ranging in age from 13 to 17 years old from one high school in the United States Virgin Islands, participated in the study. Half of the students received a robot teacher/instructor manipulation whereby a robot taught a science lesson for physical science assessments (experimental group), and the other half received the same instruction from a human teacher (control group). An analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) was used to compare the science achievement posttest scores, as measured by test scores, and science motivation posttest scores, as measured by the SMTSL, between the experimental and the control groups, while controlling for the pretest scores (covariate). The results demonstrated that posttest motivation and achievement scores in the human teacher condition were not significantly different than posttest motivation scores in the robot teacher condition. The current findings add to the literature and suggest that although a brief session with a robot teacher does not lead to a significant increase in motivation or academic achievement in an at-risk ninth grade population; it also does not lead to a significant decrease in motivation or academic achievment, making the use of robotic instructors a possible viable solution in situations where the procurement of quality teachers is difficult. Recommendations for practice include using robots as assistants in small study groups, where qualified teachers are not available, or as substitutes. The most important recommendations for future research include extending the duration of robotic manipulation, increasing the manipulation period for robotic instruction, and increasing the sample size.";1625984739;Dissertations & Theses;;Cerge, Dora;;;" Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.";; Dissertation/Thesis;; 2014; 978-1-321-33976-5;;; English; English;;;2014;ProQuest Dissertations and Theses;2014;;https://search.proquest.com/docview/1625984739?accountid=11774; 0710 Educational technology , 0714 Science education; 0710 Educational technology , 0714 Science education;; 0710 Educational technology , 0714 Science education;;; 0710 Educational technology , 0714 Science education; Educational technology , Science education; Education , At-risk learners , Ninth graders , Robot , Robotic teacher;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:Education+Database&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Using+Robots+to+Motivate+At-Risk+Learners+in+Science+over+the+Ninth+Grade+Hurdle&amp;issn=&amp;date=2014-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Cerge%2C+Dora&amp;isbn=978-1-321-33976-5&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/";ProQuest Central,Social Science Premium Collection
Trait Emotional Intelligence (EI) and Job Satisfaction: A Quantitative Analysis of Faculty that Teach Online;"While the construct of emotional intelligence (EI), has been researched and discussed for nearly 25 years, most research of this variable has been done within traditional learning and workplace environments, namely face-to-face settings (Rudestam &amp; Schoenholtz-Read, 2009), not the online learning environment, where, over the last ten plus years, education has largely been focused (Allen &amp; Seaman, 2013). Mortiboys (2012), along with Powell and Kusuma-Powell (2010), found that successful college faculty tend to possess high levels of trait EI in traditional or face-to-face classroom settings, and yet, to date, very few similar studies have been conducted with faculty teaching in an online setting. This study sought to determine whether a relationship existed between self-assessed EI scores of university faculty members teaching at least one course online and their own job satisfaction levels. This study also sought to explore EI and job satisfaction scoring differences tied to the gender of the online instructors, utilizing the Trait Emotional Intelligence Questionnaire short form (Petrides and Furnham, 2004) and the Job Satisfaction Survey (Spector, 1985). A sample of 72 faculty members that taught at least one course in an online format agreed to complete a self-report instrument. Data was analyzed using simple correlations and grounded theory principles (Glaser and Strauss, 1967). Deductive reasoning was applied to the original research questions and quantitative results and inductive reasoning to assess the qualitative responses. Results indicated that trait emotional intelligence is only slightly, positively linked to faculty job satisfaction levels, more so for females than males. An analysis of statistically significant correlations at the factor level was also conducted. The study concludes with a discussion of results, limitations and implications for future research in this area.";1622141409;Dissertations & Theses;;Cooley, Mary T.;;;" Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.";; Dissertation/Thesis;; 2014; 978-1-321-27081-5;;; English; English;;;2014;ProQuest Dissertations and Theses;2014;;https://search.proquest.com/docview/1622141409?accountid=11774; 0514 School administration , 0516 Adult education , 0525 Educational psychology , 0710 Educational technology; 0514 School administration , 0516 Adult education , 0525 Educational psychology , 0710 Educational technology;; 0514 School administration , 0516 Adult education , 0525 Educational psychology , 0710 Educational technology;;; 0514 School administration , 0516 Adult education , 0525 Educational psychology , 0710 Educational technology; School administration , Adult education , Educational psychology , Educational technology; Education , Emotional intelligence , Teaching online;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:Education+Database&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Trait+Emotional+Intelligence+%28EI%29+and+Job+Satisfaction%3A+A+Quantitative+Analysis+of+Faculty+that+Teach+Online&amp;issn=&amp;date=2014-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Cooley%2C+Mary+T.&amp;isbn=978-1-321-27081-5&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/";ProQuest Central,Social Science Premium Collection
Strengthening STEM performance and persistence: Influence of undergraduate teaching assistants on entry-level STEM students;"Increasing retention of students in science, technology, engineering, or mathematics (STEM) programs of study is a priority for many colleges and universities. This study examines an undergraduate teaching assistant (UTA) program implemented in a general chemistry course for STEM majors to provide peer learning assistance to entrylevel students. This study measured the content knowledge growth of UTAs compared to traditional graduate teaching assistants (GTAs) over the semester, and described the development of peer learning assistance skills of the UTAs as an outcome of semesterlong training and support from both science education and STEM faculty. Impact of the UTA program on final exam grades, persistence of students to enroll in the next chemistry course required by their intended major, and STEM identity of students were estimated. The study sample comprised 284 students in 14 general chemistry recitation sections led by six UTAs and 310 students in 15 general chemistry recitation sections led by three traditional GTAs for comparison. Results suggested that both UTAs and GTAs made significant learning gains in general chemistry content knowledge, and there was no significant difference in content knowledge between UTA and GTA groups. Student evaluations, researcher observations, and chemistry faculty comments confirm UTAs were using the learning strategies discussed in the semester-long training program. UTA-led students rated their TAs significantly higher in teaching quality and student care and encouragement, which correlated with stronger STEM recognition by those students. The results of hierarchical linear model (HLM) analysis showed little variance in final exam grades explained by section-level variables; most variance was explained by student-level variables: mathematics ACT score, college GPA, and intention to enroll in the next general chemistry course. Students having higher college GPAs were helped more by having a UTA. Results from logistic regression of persistence outcome variable showed that students are three times more likely to persist to CHEM 202 if they had a UTA in CHEM 201. Other positive predictors of retention included having strong college grades, and having strong ACT math scores. Coupled with HLM analysis result that UTAs were more effective at helping students with higher college GPAs achieve higher grades, the stronger persistence of UTA-led students showed that the UTA program is an effective program for retention of introductory-level students in STEM majors.";1618250780;Dissertations & Theses;;Philipp, Stephanie B.;;;" Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.";; Dissertation/Thesis;; 2014; 978-1-321-26816-4;;; English; English;;;2014;ProQuest Dissertations and Theses;2014;;https://search.proquest.com/docview/1618250780?accountid=11774; 0515 Education , 0714 Science education , 0745 Higher education; 0515 Education , 0714 Science education , 0745 Higher education;; 0515 Education , 0714 Science education , 0745 Higher education;;; 0515 Education , 0714 Science education , 0745 Higher education; Education , Science education , Higher education; Education , Engineering education , Mathematics education , Science education , Student encouragement , Technology education;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:Education+Database&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Strengthening+STEM+performance+and+persistence%3A+Influence+of+undergraduate+teaching+assistants+on+entry-level+STEM+students&amp;issn=&amp;date=2014-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Philipp%2C+Stephanie+B.&amp;isbn=978-1-321-26816-4&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/";ProQuest Central,Social Science Premium Collection
University administrators' perception of online and blended doctoral degrees;The purpose of this phenomenological study was to examine the perceptions of university administrators regarding prospective faculty candidates with online or blended doctoral degrees from accredited institutions located in Central Virginia. Administrators were interviewed to gauge their perceptions and completed a survey adapted from DePriest (2009) who adapted it from Levernier (2005). Data were collected through questionnaires, documents, and individual interviews. Data were analyzed using Creswell's (2007) data analysis spiral. Analyses were conducted using transcription, thematic coding, textural and structural descriptions, and a description of the essence of the experiences. The results indicated that administrators had a positive perception of online and blended education with a preference for faculty candidates with a blended doctoral degree.;1615091411;Dissertations & Theses;;Tharpe, Ashley Ann;;;" Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.";; Dissertation/Thesis;; 2014; 978-1-321-16466-4;;; English; English;;;2014;ProQuest Dissertations and Theses;2014;;https://search.proquest.com/docview/1615091411?accountid=11774; 0446 Higher Education Administration , 0525 Educational psychology , 0727 Curriculum development , 0745 Higher education; 0446 Higher Education Administration , 0525 Educational psychology , 0727 Curriculum development , 0745 Higher education;; 0446 Higher Education Administration , 0525 Educational psychology , 0727 Curriculum development , 0745 Higher education;;; 0446 Higher Education Administration , 0525 Educational psychology , 0727 Curriculum development , 0745 Higher education; Higher Education Administration , Educational psychology , Curriculum development , Higher education; Education , Distance learning , Doctoral degrees , Online education;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:Education+Database&amp;atitle=&amp;title=University+administrators%27+perception+of+online+and+blended+doctoral+degrees&amp;issn=&amp;date=2014-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Tharpe%2C+Ashley+Ann&amp;isbn=978-1-321-16466-4&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/";ProQuest Central,Social Science Premium Collection
Transforming the culture of the stem disciplines: A multiple case study of successful strategies for inclusive excellence;"In spite of the myriad initiatives promoting diversity and inclusion in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) disciplines at colleges and universities across the country and the increased funding for these types of initiatives, colleges and universities have experienced modest gains and, in some cases, slight declines in the graduation rates of women and underrepresented minorities (URMs). In addressing this issue, some institutions rely on traditional or ""deficit"" approaches that place primary responsibility on students for their success in the STEM fields. A growing number of institutions, however, embrace the concept of inclusive excellence, which is an assumption that underrepresented students can and will rise to high expectations provided institutions have a better understanding of and commitment to fostering the conditions in which these students thrive. Although there is much in the literature about successful programs and initiatives in the STEM disciplines that are aligned with the concept of inclusive excellence, there is little information about the organizational change processes that ensure that these initiatives are implemented on a scale large enough to significantly impact the enrollment and graduation rates of women and URMs. This study addressed the void in the literature through a multiple case study of three departments/schools at elite institutions that have had success with enrolling and graduating women and underrepresented minorities (URMs) at rates above the national average – the computer science department at Harvey Mudd College, the physics department at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and the Cockrell School of Engineering at the University of Texas Austin. Employing qualitative content analysis as the methodology, 246 documents from these institutions were analyzed both deductively with the Transformational Change Model for Inclusive Excellence as a framework and inductively to determine the strategies that advanced initiatives in the model departments and school. Analysis revealed that each department/school utilized, to some degree, strategies from the framework, including understanding and articulating the rationale for change, securing senior administrator buy-in, collaborating across multiple departments and disciplines, providing professional development for those associated with initiatives, focusing attention on the environment for underrepresented students, developing a vision for the department/school that was flexible and modified when needed, engaging in high impact and visible actions that were staged over time, and conducting comprehensive assessment and evaluation. Beyond the framework, analysis revealed that campus culture, external funding, and selective admissions also played a role in advancing initiatives on a large scale, as did other factors that were specific to each institution.";1614189558;Dissertations & Theses;;Davis, Telesia Evon;;;" Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.";; Dissertation/Thesis;; 2014; 978-1-321-15516-7;;; English; English;;;2014;ProQuest Dissertations and Theses;2014;;https://search.proquest.com/docview/1614189558?accountid=11774; 0449 Educational leadership , 0635 Organization Theory , 0703 Organizational behavior; 0449 Educational leadership , 0635 Organization Theory , 0703 Organizational behavior;; 0449 Educational leadership , 0635 Organization Theory , 0703 Organizational behavior;;; 0449 Educational leadership , 0635 Organization Theory , 0703 Organizational behavior; Educational leadership , Organization Theory , Organizational behavior; Social sciences , Education , Change strategies , Inclusive excellence , Stem disciplines , Transformational change , Underrepresented students in stem disciplines , Women in stem disciplines;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:Education+Database&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Transforming+the+culture+of+the+stem+disciplines%3A+A+multiple+case+study+of+successful+strategies+for+inclusive+excellence&amp;issn=&amp;date=2014-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Davis%2C+Telesia+Evon&amp;isbn=978-1-321-15516-7&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/";ProQuest Central,Social Science Premium Collection
Interaction: Student perceptions of knowledge acquisition in the asynchronous learning environment;The purpose of the qualitative descriptive study was to explore how interaction in the asynchronous learning environment affects student perceptions on knowledge construction. Despite the continuing growth of online learning, few researchers have explored ways in which asynchronous discourse affects cognition. The data collection methodology for the study included a digital, six-question, open-ended survey hosted on the online vendor Survey Monkey and completed by 27 teacher candidates. All of the participants had experience taking a traditional and an asynchronous college level course. Conventional content analysis was used, involving an inductive process and the inclusion of the computer analysis program Hermetic Systems Word Frequency Advanced Version Software. The analysis resulted in the identification of six major themes: amount of interaction, questions, peers, participation, convenience, and increased interaction. The main conclusions drawn from this research study were that more interaction than that found in a traditional classroom is required for authentic knowledge acquisition in the asynchronous environment. Asynchronous students construct more knowledge when they are proficient in the four types of interaction: learner-to-instructor, learner-to-learner, learner-to-content, and learner-to-interface. The first set of recommendations included the following: instructors should (a) establish a sense of immediacy, (b) create cybercafés, and (c) use digital tools to track student participation. The final recommendation was that educational leaders should require students to demonstrate technological proficiency before enrolling in an asynchronous course. These recommendations are significant to scholars, practitioners, and leaders in the asynchronous online learning community.;1571906452;Dissertations & Theses;;Griffin, Stacy A.;;;" Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.";; Dissertation/Thesis;; 2014; 978-1-321-20358-5;;; English; English;;;2014;ProQuest Dissertations and Theses;2014;;https://search.proquest.com/docview/1571906452?accountid=11774; 0449 Educational leadership , 0710 Educational technology , 0727 Curriculum development; 0449 Educational leadership , 0710 Educational technology , 0727 Curriculum development;; 0449 Educational leadership , 0710 Educational technology , 0727 Curriculum development;;; 0449 Educational leadership , 0710 Educational technology , 0727 Curriculum development; Educational leadership , Educational technology , Curriculum development; Education , Asynchronous learning environment , Constructivism , Cyber cafe , Discussion boards , Education technology , Online learning , Student interaction;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:Education+Database&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Interaction%3A+Student+perceptions+of+knowledge+acquisition+in+the+asynchronous+learning+environment&amp;issn=&amp;date=2014-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Griffin%2C+Stacy+A.&amp;isbn=978-1-321-20358-5&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/";ProQuest Central,Social Science Premium Collection
Critical discourse, cognitive presence, and intergroup dialogue narratives;This study describes a practical approach to judging the nature and quality of critical discourse in an intergroup dialogue (IGD) course. A model of a critical community of inquiry frames this research. A core concept in defining a community of inquiry is cognitive presence. In turn, the practical inquiry model operationalizes cognitive presence for the purpose of developing a tool to assess critical discourse (narratives) and reflection. This study presents the findings from coding procedures and relational content analysis conducted purposely to examine the evidence of cognitive presence in an IGD learning context. This study presents findings of the analysis that establish the existence of cognitive presence it compares assessment of 41 purposefully selected final papers from students who took a semester-long course on different social identities taught through the intergroup relations program at a large Midwestern university. The results of the study revealed four thematic categories descriptive indicators of critical thinking in IGD within (a) Triggering event the problem, challenge, task proposed by you, the faculty member as part of the design of your course. This means using problem-solving strategies as a way of achieving some of course goals. (b) Exploration the process of both individual reflection by the students and the discourse through which the problem formulation occurs. Integration the process by which students reflect individually and as a group and then reach some convergences by connecting ideas, identifying relationships and patterns, and proposing solutions. Resolution students apply and tests solutions in the real world scenarios. Learners defend their resolutions and the thinking that supports them. This study confirms the advantages associated with IGD, particularly in using the method as a pedagogical approach in motivating students in the learning process as well as in engaging them in a learning situation that equally benefits them despite their differences.;1566191016;Dissertations & Theses;;Graham, D.

Digital game-based learning (DGBL) in the L2 classroom: The impact of the UN's off-the-shelf videogame, Food Force, on learner affect and vocabulary retention;This mixed-method study explored the impact of Food Force (FF), a UN-sponsored off-the-shelf videogame, on learner affect and vocabulary learning and retention in a Japanese as a second/foreign language classroom. The videogame was integrated into an existing curriculum and two studies were performed. In Study 1 (n = 9), new vocabulary was embedded in task sheets. Study 2 (n = 11) introduced FF vocabulary explicitly and included a graded unit test. In both studies, participants took three FF vocabulary tests (pre-, post-, delayed) and an end-of-unit affect survey. Study 2 also included textbook vocabulary tests and interviews. Results indicated positive impact on learner affect and a preference for game-mediated activities over conventional exercises. Within-subject repeated-measure analysis revealed that participants in both groups recalled new FF vocabulary five weeks later at the same rate as immediately after the unit, while they significantly forgot words from the textbook. Study 2 resulted in better learning of FF words than Study 1. No gender difference was found in vocabulary test results. Positive FF effects may be evidence that digital game-based learning facilitates deep learning. Though there was significant positive effect on average, individual differences were found in students' attitudes and vocabulary retention.;1541531300;Scholarly Journals;;"Hitosugi, Claire Ikumi;Schmidt, Matthew;Hayashi, Kentaro";;; Copyright CALICO 2014; 10.11139/cj.31.1.; Journal Article;; 2014;;0742-7778;1; English; English; 19-39; San Marcos;2014;CALICO Journal;2014;31;https://search.proquest.com/docview/1541531300?accountid=11774;;; References;;; 19;; Second language learning , Computer assisted instruction--CAI , Computer & video games , Japanese language , Second language vocabulary learning , Second language learning , Computer assisted language learning , Student attitudes;;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aeducation&amp;atitle=Digital+game-based+learning+%28DGBL%29+in+the+L2+classroom%3A+The+impact+of+the+UN%27s+off-the-shelf+videogame%2C+Food+Force%2C+on+learner+affect+and+vocabulary+retention&amp;title=CALICO+Journal&amp;issn=07427778&amp;date=2014-01-01&amp;volume=31&amp;issue=1&amp;spage=19&amp;au=Hitosugi%2C+Claire+Ikumi%3BSchmidt%2C+Matthew%3BHayashi%2C+Kentaro&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=CALICO+Journal&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/10.11139%2Fcj.31.1.";ProQuest Central,SciTech Premium Collection,Social Science Premium Collection
Transforming literacy instruction: Exploring pre-service teachers' integration of tablet technology in reading, comprehension, and writing;The purpose of the study was to explore pre-service teachers' integration of tablet technology in reading, comprehension and writing instruction. As global technological use continues to soar, a large absence in the availability of tablet technology in the public schools continues, and reflects a glaring disparity between the technological uses inside and outside of education. Within a qualitative paradigm, two theoretical frameworks guided this study -- phenomenology and transformative learning (TL) theory. The researcher conducted three sets of interviews of 14 pre-service teachers. This study was guided by four research questions regarding pre-service teachers' descriptions of using technology integration in delivering reading, comprehension, and writing instruction using tutorials. The study explored the extent to which pre-service teachers employed tablet technology during learning activities. Data collected included an interview of the interpretive researcher, tutoring lesson plans, cadre conferencing blogs, and final case study reflections. Data was analyzed using Saldana's (2013) holistic coding methods and Giorgi's (1994) four-step analysis process. From the four research questions, ten essential themes emerged from pre-service teachers' lived experiences of integration of tablet technology: (a) generational learning shift, (b) cognitive disassociation with learning, (c) paradox of gaming, (d) technological disinclination, (e) critical thinking and problem solving, (f) self-generated learning, (g) collective brain and partnership, (h) collaborative creativity, (i) reluctance in integration of technology with writing, and (j) academic and recreational convenience. These themes revealed both positive shifts in the processing of innovative technology and literacy instruction, and challenges that must be overcome if pre-service teachers are to help students reach their full potential in the 21st century. An analysis of transformative learning theory (Mezirow, 1978, 1991, 2000), revealed five pre-service teachers who experienced the ten stages while another nine who experienced partial transformative learning stages. The findings have implications for the restructuring of teacher education programs. Pre-service teachers require continued increases of their technological, pedagogical and content knowledge (TPACK), as well as greater development of their writing skills. An increase in the transformation of pre-service teachers' skillsets and mindsets can be facilitated with explicit technological integration of literacy instruction to prepare them to improve student learning outcomes.;1537056654;Dissertations & Theses;;Juarez, Lucinda Marie;;;" Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.";; Dissertation/Thesis;; 2014; 978-1-303-89653-8;;; English; English;;;2014;ProQuest Dissertations and Theses;2014;;https://search.proquest.com/docview/1537056654?accountid=11774; 0530 Teacher education , 0535 Literacy , 0535 Reading instruction , 0710 Educational technology; 0530 Teacher education , 0535 Literacy , 0535 Reading instruction , 0710 Educational technology;; 0530 Teacher education , 0535 Literacy , 0535 Reading instruction , 0710 Educational technology;;; 0530 Teacher education , 0535 Literacy , 0535 Reading instruction , 0710 Educational technology; Teacher education , Literacy , Reading instruction , Educational technology; Education , Comprehension , Literacy , Pre-service teachers , Reading , Tablet devices , Technology integration , Writing;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:Education+Database&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Transforming+literacy+instruction%3A+Exploring+pre-service+teachers%27+integration+of+tablet+technology+in+reading%2C+comprehension%2C+and+writing&amp;issn=&amp;date=2014-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Juarez%2C+Lucinda+Marie&amp;isbn=978-1-303-89653-8&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/";ProQuest Central,Social Science Premium Collection
The correlation between temperament, technology preference, and proficiency in middle school students;The purpose of this study was to identity the relationship between the temperament of middle school students, their level of interest and proficiency in technology-related activities. This study also aimed to identify the differences in proficiency of the students in the technology programs. Participants were selected from two middle schools in the medium-sized rural school system. State technology test results and a student technology interest survey were analyzed using analysis of variance and descriptive statistical measurements. Correlational studies help educators evaluate existing curricula, differentiate current instruction, and plan for future programs. The results of this study suggested that there is a dominant technology temperament tied to the green measurement on the True Colors Splash test. These findings are consistent with similar studies conducted with older students and adults. Few studies have addressed technology temperament as it applies to working with younger students, therefore, this research will also add to the body of literature.;1530479621;Dissertations & Theses;;Sterling, Sabrina J.;;;" Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.";; Dissertation/Thesis;; 2014; 978-1-303-87809-1;;; English; English;;;2014;ProQuest Dissertations and Theses;2014;;https://search.proquest.com/docview/1530479621?accountid=11774; 0450 Middle School education , 0525 Educational psychology , 0710 Educational technology; 0450 Middle School education , 0525 Educational psychology , 0710 Educational technology;; 0450 Middle School education , 0525 Educational psychology , 0710 Educational technology;;; 0450 Middle School education , 0525 Educational psychology , 0710 Educational technology; Middle School education , Educational psychology , Educational technology; Education , Differentiation , Keirsey temperament sorter , Middle school , Myers-briggs type indicator , Technology , Temperament;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:Education+Database&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+correlation+between+temperament%2C+technology+preference%2C+and+proficiency+in+middle+school+students&amp;issn=&amp;date=2014-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Sterling%2C+Sabrina+J.&amp;isbn=978-1-303-87809-1&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/";ProQuest Central,Social Science Premium Collection
The effects of teacher experience on the workplace readiness of high school students;Over the last decade attention has been placed on the emergent gap between education and the workplace. In response, school systems have provided instructional opportunities such as career pathways to better prepare students with the necessary knowledge and skills needed to be workplace ready. This dissertation sought to review two factors considered essential to this endeavor--teacher experience in business and industry and career and technical education (CTE). In doing so, this causal-comparative study examined 594 high school students in a northwest Georgia school district to see if there was a difference in the ACT WorkKeys® scores of students completing a career pathway taught by an instructor with two or more years of experience in business and industry and students completing a career pathway taught by an instructor without two or more years of experience in business and industry. Additionally, there was an examination to see if a difference exists between the scores of students completing a CTE career pathway and students completing a non-CTE career pathway. Students took the ACT WorkKeys® assessment in Applied Mathematics, Locating Information, and Reading for Information with their results reported as scale and level scores. Though no statistically significant differences were concluded related to the effects of teacher experience on the workplace readiness of high school students, this study serves as an indicator that workplace preparation needs to be further addressed to ensure a viable workforce in the 21st century.

A tablet-PC software application for statistics classes;"A significant deficiency in the area of introductory statistics education exists: Student performance on standardized assessments after a full semester statistics course is poor and students report a very low desire to learn statistics. Research on the current generation of students indicates an affinity for technology and for multitasking. Generational research further indicates that millennials prefer immediate feedback and to be in control of their learning environment. A tablet PC mediated, multitasking, classroom intervention involving the use of tablet computers with a newly designed educational software application was designed as a solution to the challenge of statistics education. Software development for this research project focused on the specific educational needs of students born after 1982, defined here as millennials, with an emphasis on increasing active participation and learning through on-task multitasking and in-class chatting. The tablet PCs allowed students to utilize a virtual ""pen"" to take notes on pre-prepared instructional materials. A discussion area associated with each slide encouraged peer to peer collaboration in class while slide specific links to external content encouraged students to seek immediate clarification on challenging material. Previous tablet PC based classroom interventions are well liked by students but focused on slide annotations or note-taking alone. The immediacy requirement of millennials suggested that access to supplemental materials as the lecture is presented might prove valuable to mastering course content. Given the technological aptitude of the millennial generation and their unique learning preferences, a tablet PC based educational intervention was designed as the core of a pedagogical paradigm shift. Data collected using the tablet PC application in the fall of 2011 revealed that students did not learn or retain more than students in traditional classrooms. Students' desire to learn statistics was improved by the tablet PC initiative although students with greater computer skills, those who enjoyed learning with a computer and those who liked multitasking improved the most in their attitude towards statistics using the tablet PCs. Students did perform better on questions requiring statistical or graphical interpretation when using the tablet PC mediated classroom as compared to the traditional classroom. There was a drop in learning in the most skilled computer users suggesting that excessive multitasking may be detrimental to classroom learning. Females in the study reported lower familiarity levels with technology, a decreased desire to multitask and a lower desire to use a computer to learn than males. The tablet PC application had a significantly greater impact on males than females due to these learning preferences. While the tablet PC classroom environment did not successfully resolve the deficiency in statistics education, the research reveals some promising directions for future research.";1499242131;Dissertations & Theses;;Probst, Alexandre C.;;;" Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.";; Dissertation/Thesis;; 2014; 978-1-303-69967-2;;; English; English;;;2014;ProQuest Dissertations and Theses;2014;;https://search.proquest.com/docview/1499242131?accountid=11774; 0463 Statistics , 0710 Educational technology; 0463 Statistics , 0710 Educational technology;; 0463 Statistics , 0710 Educational technology;;; 0463 Statistics , 0710 Educational technology; Statistics , Educational technology; Pure sciences , Education , Educational software , Introductory statistics , Millennials , Multi-tasking , Statistics education , Tablet PCs;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:Advanced+Technologies+%26+Aerospace+Dissertations&amp;atitle=&amp;title=A+tablet-PC+software+application+for+statistics+classes&amp;issn=&amp;date=2014-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Probst%2C+Alexandre+C.&amp;isbn=978-1-303-69967-2&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/";SciTech Premium Collection
Employability of IT graduates from the industry's perspective: a case study in Turkey;  The qualifications that constitute the employability and identity of graduates are viewed differently by the academic community and the industry. Currently, it is observed for Information Technologies (IT) sector that the demands of the industry are not always satisfied by the perceived standards of the graduates. To provide feedback to the corresponding departments, a survey regarding employer expectations and factors affecting these expectations has been conducted among a number of senior professionals and managers working in the IT sector in Turkey regarding this inconsistency. The employer expectations are considered in two empirical categories as competencies and adequacies. The multiple regression analysis technique has been used to analyze the survey data. Based on the analysis, recommendations are provided to IT departments as well as their students to better fulfill the demands of the industry.;1655725460;Scholarly Journals;;"Turhan, Cigdem;Akman, Ibrahim";;; Education Research Institute, Seoul National University, Seoul, Korea 2013; 10.1007/s12564-013-9278-5; Feature;; Dec 2013;;1598-1037;4; English; English; 523-536; Dordrecht;Dec 2013;Asia Pacific Education Review;2013;14;https://search.proquest.com/docview/1655725460?accountid=11774;;; References;;; 523;; Information technology , Vocational education , Skill development , Case studies , Turkey;;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aeducation&amp;atitle=Employability+of+IT+graduates+from+the+industry%27s+perspective%3A+a+case+study+in+Turkey&amp;title=Asia+Pacific+Education+Review&amp;issn=15981037&amp;date=2013-12-01&amp;volume=14&amp;issue=4&amp;spage=523&amp;au=Turhan%2C+Cigdem%3BAkman%2C+Ibrahim&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=Asia+Pacific+Education+Review&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/10.1007%2Fs12564-013-9278-5";ProQuest Central,Social Science Premium Collection
Evaluating the impact of an agile transformation: a longitudinal case study in a distributed context;  Many software-development organizations have recently started to adopt agile practices in order to benefit from the improvements they clearly bring, in terms of production speed and software quality, for example. However, in a large, distributed organization, such as Nokia Siemens Networks, an agile transformation may be a long-term, complex process, and therefore, evaluating the benefits achieved, and measuring the success of the change, can be difficult, especially in the early phases of the transformation. This paper is based on the results of a case study on the impact introducing agile practices actually had in a large, software-development organization, part of Nokia Siemens Networks. The impact of this agile transformation was evaluated in terms of how well it succeeded in achieving the goals set by the management before the transformation started. This longitudinal study included two separate analyses, made at 6 monthly intervals, which measured what agile practices were really in use in the organization, and what effects, if any, were visible in terms of the goals which had been set by the management The 6 monthly analyses included defect data metrics and opinion surveys of the personnel directly involved in the transformation. The study showed two things: firstly, that the introduction of agile practices does have the beneficial effects that one would expect, and secondly, that, using this kind of study, it is not only possible to evaluate the impact that the adoption of agile practices has in a large, established software-development company, but also that the effects are visible at a surprisingly early stage.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT];1434120379;Scholarly Journals;;Korhonen, Kirsi;;; Springer Science+Business Media New York 2013; 10.1007/s11219-012-9189-4; Feature;; Dec 2013;;0963-9314;4; English; English; 599-624; Dordrecht;Dec 2013;Software Quality Journal;2013;21;https://search.proquest.com/docview/1434120379?accountid=11774; 7500 Product planning & development , 5240 Software & systems , 5320 Quality control , 2600 Management science/operations research , 2500 Organizational behavior , 9130 Experimental/theoretical; 7500 Product planning & development , 5240 Software & systems , 5320 Quality control , 2600 Management science/operations research , 2500 Organizational behavior , 9130 Experimental/theoretical;; 7500 Product planning & development , 5240 Software & systems , 5320 Quality control , 2600 Management science/operations research , 2500 Organizational behavior , 9130 Experimental/theoretical;; 599; 7500 Product planning & development , 5240 Software & systems , 5320 Quality control , 2600 Management science/operations research , 2500 Organizational behavior , 9130 Experimental/theoretical; Product development , Software engineering , Quality , Organization theory , Analysis , Studies;;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aabiglobal&amp;atitle=Evaluating+the+impact+of+an+agile+transformation%3A+a+longitudinal+case+study+in+a+distributed+context&amp;title=Software+Quality+Journal&amp;issn=09639314&amp;date=2013-12-01&amp;volume=21&amp;issue=4&amp;spage=599&amp;au=Korhonen%2C+Kirsi&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=Software+Quality+Journal&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/10.1007%2Fs11219-012-9189-4";ProQuest Central,SciTech Premium Collection
Training Teachers to Learn by Design, Through a Community of Inquiry;"  As eLearning is evolving into a mainstream, widespread practice, adopted by higher education institutions worldwide, much effort is geared towards the articulation of models and strategies for eLearning implementation in formal education settings. In the field of pre-service teacher education, a rising challenge is to equip the ""21st century teacher"" with the necessary toolset of skills, competencies and mindsets to grapple with the idiosyncrasies of the new generation of ""millenials"". To this purpose, what still remains an open issue is the degree of innovation afforded by specific eLearning designs, in a field where traditional teacher training pedagogies co-exist with eLearning-specific ones. This article proposes a synthesis of two eLearning-specific models, the Community of Inquiry (COI) Model, based on the Practical Inquiry Model introduced by Garrison, Anderson, &amp; Archer (2000) and the Learning by Design framework (LbyD), based on the conceptualization of 'New Learning', as articulated by Kalantzis &amp; Cope (2012). Both models were invented with new and learning styles and circumstances in mind. The six-month introductory course on ""Pedagogical designs with ICT"" was offered by the School of Pedagogical and Technological Education (ASPETE) and implemented with 20 trainee teachers at the Higher Education Technological Institute (TEI) of Lamia, located in another geographical area of Greece. In this context, elements of the COI framework were employed as tools both for designing and for evaluating the contents, structure and activities of the eLearning course. Two elements of the framework, teaching and cognitive presence were the axes supporting the course structure, whilst the kinds of activities we aimed at promoting the most were discussion, collaboration and reflection. The LbyD framework served as an awareness enhancement mechanism for trainee teachers to formulate, collaboratively negotiate and finally express pedagogical scenarios integrating the meaningful use of technology. The discussion of this experience is supported by a preliminary analysis on the basis of COI-based questionnaires distributed to students, written free-text student feedback, asynchronous discussion transcripts and final students' products in the form of learning scenarios integrating the use of technology.

Challenging Pre-Service Teachers' on Collaborative Authoring of Learning Designs in a Blended Learning Context;  In this paper we explore the potential of collaboration in a pre-service teacher training course on technology enhanced learning as well as the skills that trainees cultivate when working with learning design environments, developing Web 2.0 objects, and collaborating using specific pedagogical tools. Technological Pedagogical Content Knowledge (TPACK) framework is used as the basis for designing the curriculum and content of the course with a constructivist perspective aiming to cultivate various types of knowledge such as technology content knowledge (TCK), technological pedagogical knowledge (TPK), and technological pedagogical content knowledge (TPACK). Trainees worked initially individually to get familiar with technological and pedagogical tools, and then in groups in order to develop a learning design. Groups were mainly interdisciplinary with mixed ability on using technology since they were formulated either randomly or according to the individual characteristics of the trainees such as personality traits and other psychological variables (e.g. self-efficacy, anxiety and attitudes). Preliminary results are discussed focusing on the way that trainees perceived collaboration with peers as well as on how capable they became in using several technological and pedagogical tools and integrating them in technology enhanced course designs. More specifically, trainees seem to appreciate collaboration in groups and many of them seem to face interdisciplinary collaboration as an opportunity that promotes discourse and ideas exchange. The difficulties they faced in collaborating with the members of their group are focused on the different time schedules, ways of thinking, working and behaving, not being familiar with group work and the variety of disciplines involved in the group. Also, trainees seem to acknowledge the technological and pedagogical tools proposed as useful for designing activities and technology enhanced courses but they characterize the process followed as time consuming. Trainees' learning designs provide evidence about the capabilities they developed in designing courses that sufficiently integrate technological tools under the principles of a learner-centered contemporary pedagogy.

Analysis of Students?Performances during Lab Sessions of Computer Networks Course;Due to changes and developments on the information and communication technologies, computer networks gained a critical role for establishing connections to share resources in a specific domain. Sharing information is very important in the digital age for giving high-quality services to all interested people enrolled in the networks. Education of computer networks is an engineering discipline to teach network topics and subjects within the university curriculum. Network courses are offered to the students of the related departments in universities and higher education organizations. In this paper, we conducted a study for analyzing the performances of the computer engineering students at Baskent University, Ankara, Turkey on the Network Course, in both theoretical and practical means. We analyzed the weekly scores collected from the lab sessions throughout the academic semesters of 2007-2008, 2008-2009 and 2009-2010 by using One-way and Two-way Anova and Chi-Square tests. Additionally, students’ opinions about the course and lab sessions were evaluated by questionnaires at the end of each semester during 3 years.;2139170954;Scholarly Journals;;"Bulent Gursel Emiroglu;Sahin, Seda";;; © 2013.

Sparking Innovation in STEM Education with Technology and Collaboration: A CASE STUDY OF THE HP CATALYST INITIATIVE;  This report highlights innovative technology-supported pedagogic models in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) education, explores what to expect from collaboration in a designed network, and, thereafter, sketches lessons for promoting educational innovation through collaboration. How can technology-supported learning help to move beyond content delivery and truly enhance STEM education so that students develop a broad mix of skills? How can collaboration be encouraged and used to help develop, spread, accelerate and sustain innovation in education? The HP Catalyst Initiative - an education grant programme by the Hewlett Packard (HP) Sustainability and Social Innovation team - is used as a case study to answer these questions. First, five technology-supported pedagogic models emerging from the Initiative are highlighted: gaming, virtual laboratories, international collaborative projects, real-time formative assessment and skills-based assessment. These models have the potential to improve students' learning outcomes, including development of higher-order thinking skills, and to expand the range of learning opportunities made available to students. Second, the report explores the value of collaboration and support for innovation and outlines lessons for policy-makers and other stakeholders promoting educational innovation through collaboration. It shows that collaboration, especially international collaboration, can be an effective means to foster knowledge flows, new ideas and peer learning. The results presented in the report are based on a mix of quantitative monitoring and qualitative case study methodology.

Supporting Case-based Learning in Information Security with Web-based Technology;  Case-based learning has been widely used in many disciplines. As an effective pedagogical method, case-based learning is also being used to support teaching and learning in the domain of information security. In this paper, we demonstrate case-based learning in information security by sharing our experiences in using a case study to teach security management.

Learning programming with serious games;Students who are learning to program often have difficulties understanding cognitively complex concepts. Teaching programming is mainly focused on the syntax and features of programs, rather than to a deeper understanding of programming constructs and abstract concepts. Computer game stimulates active learning and presentation of learning content in a variety of contexts that are funny and engaging for students. This has a positive impact on the motivation to learn. This paper deals mainly with defining the programming knowledge and common problems with teaching programming, comparing the properties of novice and experts programmers and introducing the semantic method of teaching programming where one would teach only the semantics of programming constructs unbound to specific programming language in an interactive motivating setting of educational computer game. In this paper we discuss the main characteristics of computer games and specific features which makes them useful in the educational setting. As an example of presented method we introduce a game on the presentation of variables in programming. The game is based on visualizations of different types of variables and on the interpretation of the assignment sentence. The game actively encourages interactivity and deeper learning.;2306505751;Scholarly Journals;;"Zapušek, Matej;Rugelj, Jože";;; © 2013.

Mehke veščine v visokošolskem izobraževanju;Although in its strategic documents the European Commission emphasizes the importance of soft skills for achieving the key goals of the Bologna process, it seems that soft skills have not found their way into higher education study programs yet. The reason for this is partly in a very traditionalistic stand of the European higher education environment, which gives priority to scientific groundings over practical applicability. This study addresses the question of key soft skills, which should be included in higher education study programs either as independent modules or integrated in the existing modules or else offered as extra curricular activities to students. Based on the empirical research, conducted by human resource experts in six countries, soft skills can be clustered into three groups personal, social and methodological/contextual. In the concluding part of the paper the expected learning outcomes are defined in order to stimulate inclusion of soft skills into higher education study programs.;1891905744;Scholarly Journals;;Vadnjal, Jaka;;; Copyright University of Ljubljana, Faculty of Arts 2013; 10.4312/as.19.1.45-57; Journal Article;; 2013;;1318-5160;1; Slovenian; Slovenian; 45-57; Ljubljana;2013;Andragoska Spoznanja;2013;19;https://search.proquest.com/docview/1891905744?accountid=11774;;;;;; 45;; Higher education; soft skills , competences , higher education , learning , study programs;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Apqrl&amp;atitle=Mehke+ve%26scaron%3B%C4%8Dine+v+visoko%26scaron%3Bolskem+izobra%C5%BEevanju&amp;title=Andragoska+Spoznanja&amp;issn=13185160&amp;date=2013-01-01&amp;volume=19&amp;issue=1&amp;spage=45&amp;au=Vadnjal%2C+Jaka&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=Andragoska+Spoznanja&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/10.4312%2Fas.19.1.45-57";ProQuest Central
Emotional Intelligence and Public Health Education: A Prescriptive Needs Assessment;Emotional Intelligence is an ability that is crucial to the field of public health due to the fact that it encompasses the practitioner’s ability to communicate professionally, show empathy, obtain patient compliance and promote sustainable lifestyle changes in communities. This study seeks to evaluate a public health program in order to determine what emotional intelligence training currently exists, and what the attitudes of stakeholders are regarding emotional intelligence and its importance to the field of public health. This is done through interviews with the faculty, administrators and students, as well as a questionnaire that asks students to assess their own abilities in the area of emotional intelligence. The information gathered makes it possible to formulate recommendations to further incorporate emotional intelligence-building activities into the program. Results of the study show a direct correlation between public health and emotional intelligence competencies, which makes it an ideal program in which to integrate further training. Additionally, results indicate a gap between student’s self perception regarding their emotional intelligence abilities, and the perception their faculty and administration of student’s abilities. Finally, a significant lack of student engagement due to dissatisfaction with acceptance requirements appears to contribute to the perception of low emotional intelligence on the part of the students. Recommendations for future development of emotional intelligence in the program include the incorporation of training into the existing Orientation week, the addition of case studies into the courses most naturally related to emotional intelligence-building, the provision of training seminars for faculty, the inclusion of an advanced seminar for students on a voluntary basis, and the evaluation of the program using both a self-report emotional intelligence questionnaire and the Mayer, Salovey and Caruso Emotional Intelligence Test (MSCEIT) at the beginning and end of each term in order to track program effectiveness in the long term.;1709243557;Dissertations & Theses;;Johnson, Debbi R.;;;" Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.";; Dissertation/Thesis;; 2013; 978-1-321-89345-8;;; English; English;;;2013;ProQuest Dissertations and Theses;2013;;https://search.proquest.com/docview/1709243557?accountid=11774; 0449 Educational leadership , 0680 Health education; 0449 Educational leadership , 0680 Health education;; 0449 Educational leadership , 0680 Health education;;; 0449 Educational leadership , 0680 Health education; Educational leadership , Health education; Education , Emotional intelligence , Higher education , Public health education;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:Education+Database&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Emotional+Intelligence+and+Public+Health+Education%3A+A+Prescriptive+Needs+Assessment&amp;issn=&amp;date=2013-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Johnson%2C+Debbi+R.&amp;isbn=978-1-321-89345-8&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/";ProQuest Central,Social Science Premium Collection
A meta-analysis of the effectiveness of STEM-programs in the United States;"The federal government has been spending a large amount of funds on STEM programs. It is important to examine the effectiveness of such spending. Much research has been conducted in the past 30 years for this particular purpose; however, the results of such evaluations have not painted a clear picture of the effectiveness of STEM programs. The goal of this meta-analysis is to investigate whether STEM programs are successful in the outcomes they claim to achieve. Such a meta-analysis must integrate all of the empirical studies which reported their effort in evaluating the effectiveness of STEM programs, based on measures of (1) engagement, (2) capability, and (3) continuity (Jolly, Campbell, and Perlman (2004). Previous studies on the STEM program effectiveness used either a within-subject design or a between-subject design. First, each of these research designs was investigated independently to examine whether the particular design has an effect on estimates of STEM program effectiveness. In addition, other moderators were investigated to determine factors that could influence estimates of STEM program effectiveness: pedagogical types of programs, program funders, program creators, grade level of sample groups, regional locations, instrument reliabilities, publication types, time, etc. The metaanalysis covers literature published between 1980 and 2010. The total number of studies included in this meta-analysis is 91. This study finds that all three outcome variables have positive effect sizes at the moderate level with the weighted mean effect sizes of .346 for engagement, .456 for capability, and .369 for continuity measurements. Additionally, the between-subject design versus within-subject design has an effect on estimates of the engagement and capability outcomes of STEM programs. Finally, some moderator variables were statistically significant on the outcome variables with the mean effect sizes: program strategy, program creator, regional location, and educational level of sample group. These findings suggest the best pedagogical types of STEM programs, program creators, and the most effective target groups in order to achieve maximum effects of STEM programs.";1646483224;Dissertations & Theses;;An, Dayoung;;;" Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.";; Dissertation/Thesis;; 2013; 978-1-321-48338-3;;; English; English;;;2013;ProQuest Dissertations and Theses;2013;;https://search.proquest.com/docview/1646483224?accountid=11774; 0458 Education Policy , 0617 Public administration , 0630 Public policy , 0714 Science education; 0458 Education Policy , 0617 Public administration , 0630 Public policy , 0714 Science education;; 0458 Education Policy , 0617 Public administration , 0630 Public policy , 0714 Science education;;; 0458 Education Policy , 0617 Public administration , 0630 Public policy , 0714 Science education; Education Policy , Public administration , Public policy , Science education; Social sciences , Education , Program effectiveness , Program outcomes , STEM programs;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:Education+Database&amp;atitle=&amp;title=A+meta-analysis+of+the+effectiveness+of+STEM-programs+in+the+United+States&amp;issn=&amp;date=2013-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=An%2C+Dayoung&amp;isbn=978-1-321-48338-3&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/";ProQuest Central,Social Science Premium Collection
Evaluation of EHR Training as a catalyst to achieve clinician satisfaction with technology in acute care setting;Training for Electronic Health Record (EHR) has been recognized as a key facilitator to ensure optimum use and satisfaction with technology. However, research on the ways in which training can promote user satisfaction with technology and a smooth transition to EHR is lacking. This study aims to expand the available literature on the delivery of effective EHR training. End-users may still not perceive the values that EHR can bring to healthcare by improving quality of care and streamlining the delivery of services, although these values are well established. Several barriers can account for the lack of perception, including limited resources, lack of organizational support, and poor clinical ownership of technology. Training provides an excellent tool to communicate the initiatives behind technology implementation, to help users understand the benefits that EHR can bring, and ultimately to improve the satisfaction of the end-users with technology and enhance their adoption. The organizations implementing EHR need to focus on delivery of effective training by allocating sufficient time and resources to training. Trainers need to link with users by understanding different learning styles and adult learning principles, and practicing these principles to support different training methods.;1520432451;Dissertations & Theses;;Youssef, Walid;;;" Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.";; Dissertation/Thesis;; 2013; 978-0-499-26580-7;;; English; English;;;2013;ProQuest Dissertations and Theses;2013;;https://search.proquest.com/docview/1520432451?accountid=11774; 0769 Health care management; 0769 Health care management;; 0769 Health care management;;; 0769 Health care management; Health care management; Health and environmental sciences , Electronic Health Records and adoption , Training;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:Healthcare+Administration+Database&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Evaluation+of+EHR+Training+as+a+catalyst+to+achieve+clinician+satisfaction+with+technology+in+acute+care+setting&amp;issn=&amp;date=2013-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Youssef%2C+Walid&amp;isbn=978-0-499-26580-7&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/";ProQuest Central
"""Can a basket hide an elephant?""— Engaged language policy and practices toward educational, linguistic, and socioeconomic equity in Vietnam";"Scholars concerned with education and socioeconomic equity increasingly argue that globalization and neoliberalism have brought about a troubling trend toward commodification and expansion of English language education (Coleman, 2011; Heller, 2012). Language and education scholars (Appleby, 2010; Phillipson, 2012) warn that English language spread largely entails linguistic and cultural homogenization, broad socio-economic stratification, massive resource exploitation, and deteriorated social welfare. Taking these concerns into account, this study employed engaged language policy (ELP) (Davis, forthcoming; Davis, Phyak, &amp; Bui, 2012) to explore Vietnamese language policy and planning from the perspectives of global ideologies, national agendas, and local transformation. At the macro level, this account describes how language policies, neoliberal ideologies increasingly fail to realize linguistic, cultural, economic equity. Drawing on Freire’s (1970) critical consciousness-raising approach, meso and micro analyses focus on portraying the dialogic processes of researcher, teachers, and minority students in a remote and mountainous province as they interrogate the impact of language policies and practices on their lives and work. Our collective findings indicate that, contrary to the state’s goal of promoting English for socioeconomic and educational advancement, language policies largely threaten social, educational and economic development, and minority students’ linguistic and cultural ecology. Since students in the region speak minority languages at home, they are disadvantaged by a Vietnamese as medium of instruction and English as required subject school policy. The study thus emphasizes the urgent need for a comprehensive understanding of the interconnectedness among cultural and linguistic complexity; language/literacy education; socio-economic needs; and local agency throughout the macro, meso, and micro level processes of language policy decision-making and implementation. It strongly recommends respecting home languages for effective schooling, a strong economy, resourceful citizens, and social security at local and global scales. To this end, the study advocates taking ELP as an effective epistemological and agentive approach at the center of language policy research; it cultivates and repositions individual and collective agency at the forefront of language policy activism while creating a respectful and intellectual forum between the researcher and multiple actors to facilitate transparent and transformative education, diversity, social welfare, and an egalitarian society.";1513230560;Dissertations & Theses;;Bui, Thuy Thi Ngoc;;;" Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.";; Dissertation/Thesis;; 2013; 978-1-303-79321-9;;; English; English;;;2013;ProQuest Dissertations and Theses;2013;;https://search.proquest.com/docview/1513230560?accountid=11774; 0282 Bilingual education , 0441 English as a Second Language , 0458 Education Policy; 0282 Bilingual education , 0441 English as a Second Language , 0458 Education Policy;; 0282 Bilingual education , 0441 English as a Second Language , 0458 Education Policy;;; 0282 Bilingual education , 0441 English as a Second Language , 0458 Education Policy; Bilingual education , English as a Second Language , Education Policy; Education , Bilingualism , Education , Engaged ethnography , English , Language policy , Multiculturalism , Vietnam;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:Education+Database&amp;atitle=&amp;title=%22Can+a+basket+hide+an+elephant%3F%22%E2%80%94+Engaged+language+policy+and+practices+toward+educational%2C+linguistic%2C+and+socioeconomic+equity+in+Vietnam&amp;issn=&amp;date=2013-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Bui%2C+Thuy+Thi+Ngoc&amp;isbn=978-1-303-79321-9&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/";ProQuest Central,Social Science Premium Collection
Flipped instruction: An investigation into the effect of learning environment on student self-efficacy, learning style, and academic achievement in an Algebra I classroom;"This study utilized an explanatory mixed-methods research design to investigate the effect of learning environment on student mathematics achievement, and mathematics self-efficacy, and student learning style in a ninth grade Algebra I classroom. The study also explored the lived experiences of the teachers and students in the three different learning environments and the effect students' learning style had on preference for learning environment. Key findings of the study were: 1) students in the Flipped Active and Flipped Mastery learning environments scored significantly higher on mathematics achievement than students in the Traditional learning environment; 2) students in the Flipped Mastery learning environment scored significantly higher on mathematics self-efficacy than students in the Traditional learning environment; 3) students in both the Flipped Active and Flipped Mastery learning environments appreciated the level of control over the learning process but were dissatisfied by the inability to ask real-time questions; 4) students in the Flipped Mastery learning environment enjoyed working at an individualistic pace but struggled with falling behind; and 5) students preferring active, sensing, sequential, and verbal learning experiences expressed satisfaction with both the Flipped Active and Flipped Mastery learning environments. The study findings suggest that classroom teachers should utilize the Flipped Instructional approach to make more in-class time for active learning strategies; and implement mastery learning strategies to promote student responsibility, self-regulation, and ownership of the learning process. Future research should investigate the effect that Flipped Instruction has on the learning environment at the middle and high school level as well as in subject areas other than mathematics.";1505373684;Dissertations & Theses;;Wiginton, Barry Lynn;;;" Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.";; Dissertation/Thesis;; 2013; 978-1-303-73428-1;;; English; English;;;2013;ProQuest Dissertations and Theses;2013;;https://search.proquest.com/docview/1505373684?accountid=11774; 0280 Mathematics education , 0710 Educational technology; 0280 Mathematics education , 0710 Educational technology;; 0280 Mathematics education , 0710 Educational technology;;; 0280 Mathematics education , 0710 Educational technology; Mathematics education , Educational technology; Education , Active , Flipped , Inverted , Learning environment , Mastery , Technology;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:Education+Database&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Flipped+instruction%3A+An+investigation+into+the+effect+of+learning+environment+on+student+self-efficacy%2C+learning+style%2C+and+academic+achievement+in+an+Algebra+I+classroom&amp;issn=&amp;date=2013-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Wiginton%2C+Barry+Lynn&amp;isbn=978-1-303-73428-1&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/";ProQuest Central,Social Science Premium Collection
Assessing Student Learning in Computer Science - A Case Study;  Student learning outcomes are statements that describe what students are expected to know and be able to do by the time of graduation. In order to assess the extent to which an outcome is met, it is necessary to define an outcome in terms of measurable performance indicators. Rubrics allow collection of relevant data and their consistent interpretation. Using just one outcome as an example, this paper presents the approach used by the College at Brockport, State University of New York to define appropriate performance indicators, construct a curriculum map, develop holistic rubrics, collect data, evaluate, and use the findings for continuous program improvement.

"Designing complex, interactive, architectural systems with CIAS-DM: A model-based, human-centered, design &amp;amp; analysis methodology";"The built environment increasingly contributes to improving human health, well-being, and performance in measurable, predictable, and tailorable ways. Achieving high-performance environmental systems requires real-time-interactive sensing, monitoring, actuation, and communication subsystems, as well as real-time interactions of these environmental systems with their users and other internal and external systems. Developing theories, constructs, methods, and tools necessary for designing such high-performance, complex, interactive systems is an active area of research. This dissertation focused on methods and tools for representing the cognitive and physical affordances of complex, interactive, architectural systems (CIAS). The Complex, Interactive, Architectural Systems Design Methodology (CIAS-DM) was proposed as a method and tool for helping designers uncover and document the scope of proposed CIAS. CIAS-DM was evaluated qualitatively. This project used the design of a `smart' mattress in a patient room `smart' bed/mattress/over-the-bed table ecosystem as the basis for a series of design cases. Fourteen clinicians participated as subject matter experts. Four research associates participated as raters. The results of evaluating CIAS-DM indicate that CIAS-DM is useful for scoping CIAS design challenges. The contributions of this dissertation are: 1) identifying and characterizing CIAS; 2) introducing the systems modeling language (SysML) and a cognitive work analysis (CWA) representational and analytic methods into architecture; 2) mapping constructs and methods from CWA into SysML; and 3) providing these methods and tools in an integrated package appropriate for those designing CIAS.";1499237325;Dissertations & Theses;;Manganelli, Joseph Charles;;;" Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.";; Dissertation/Thesis;; 2013; 978-1-303-69147-8;;; English; English;;;2013;ProQuest Dissertations and Theses;2013;;https://search.proquest.com/docview/1499237325?accountid=11774; 0624 Occupational psychology , 0729 Architecture , 0790 Systems science; 0624 Occupational psychology , 0729 Architecture , 0790 Systems science;; 0624 Occupational psychology , 0729 Architecture , 0790 Systems science;;; 0624 Occupational psychology , 0729 Architecture , 0790 Systems science; Occupational psychology , Architecture , Systems science; Communication and the arts , Applied sciences , Psychology , Architecture , Cognitive work analysis , Complex, interactive, architectural systems , User-centered;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:Publicly+Available+Content+Database&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Designing+complex%2C+interactive%2C+architectural+systems+with+CIAS-DM%3A+A+model-based%2C+human-centered%2C+design+%26amp%3B+analysis+methodology&amp;issn=&amp;date=2013-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Manganelli%2C+Joseph+Charles&amp;isbn=978-1-303-69147-8&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/";ProQuest Central
Lifetimes and Legacies: Temporalities of Sociotechnical Change in a Long-Lived System;In studying technological change, we often seek to understand the dynamics of how technologies and practice shape each other over time, examining sites of innovation, adaptation, and appropriation, of making and re-making systems anew. However less attention has been given to how formerly cutting-edge technologies become old, how people work alongside aging and obsolescent systems, or how organizations prepare for the end of a technology's life cycle. In this dissertation, I argue that this bias towards progressivist accounts of technological change obscures the lived temporal relations of systems work. I present research drawn from ten months of ethnographic fieldwork with engineers at the Cassini mission to Saturn, at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, in Pasadena, CA. Having launched in 1997, the longevity of the mission means that their work takes place in the context of an aging spacecraft and increasingly obsolescent software infrastructure. As the mission is bound to complete in 2017, engineers are beginning to plan for and work towards the end of the mission and reflect on its origins and possible legacies. Cassini thus offers a perspicuous case for understanding technological change. I examine how Cassini's computational infrastructure mediates the work of translating across multiple temporal concerns – from multi-year science objectives to the run time of algorithms to the lifetimes and legacies of hardware and software tools. In doing so, I shift attention from understanding how technologies emerge in practice, to how people live with technological change at the duration of lived experience. I articulate a lens that reveals technological change not as a single phenomenon belonging to a totalized system (e.g., the organizational infrastructure, information ecology, or sociotechnical system) but rather as multiple modes or regimes among which people, and organizations, evaluate how technologies (ought to) develop over time.;1469746267;Dissertations & Theses;;Cohn, Marisa Leavitt;;;" Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.";; Dissertation/Thesis;; 2013; 978-1-303-58722-1;;; English; English;;;2013;ProQuest Dissertations and Theses;2013;;https://search.proquest.com/docview/1469746267?accountid=11774; 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0489 Information Technology , 0723 Information science; 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0489 Information Technology , 0723 Information science;; 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0489 Information Technology , 0723 Information science;;; 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0489 Information Technology , 0723 Information science; Cultural anthropology , Information Technology , Information science; Social sciences , Communication and the arts , Applied sciences , Long-lived , Materiality , Obsolescence , Repair , Sociotechnical systems , Temporality;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:Social+Science+Database&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Lifetimes+and+Legacies%3A+Temporalities+of+Sociotechnical+Change+in+a+Long-Lived+System&amp;issn=&amp;date=2013-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Cohn%2C+Marisa+Leavitt&amp;isbn=978-1-303-58722-1&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/";ProQuest Central,Social Science Premium Collection
Public relations models and dialogic communication in the Twitterverse: An analysis of how colleges and universities are engaging their public through Twitter;Colleges and universities throughout this world are realizing the importance of engaging in and building mutually-beneficial relationships with their key publics through social media. The introduction of the microblogging tool known as Twitter extends the use of social media in higher education, beyond the classroom, and into the realm of public relations where it can be just as effective. Now, colleges and universities are capitalizing off of its potential as a public relations tool. Twitter allows colleges and universities to better connect with their technology-consumed publics trough dialogic and interactive two-way communication. This study examines how 155 colleges and universities use Twitter as a relationship-building and communication tool. Grounded in Kent and Taylor’s (1998) dialogic principles and Grunig and Hunt’s (1984) four models of public relations, this dissertation is based on a content analysis that examined higher education use of Twitter as a means of communication. This study analyzed the individual tweets (N = 1,550) of 155 colleges and universities during a two-week sampling period. The data revealed that 38.5% of the tweets aligned with the dialogic principle of Conservation of Return Visitors, while 49.7% of the tweets aligned with the Press Agentry/Publicity model of public relations. Medium interactivity was featured in the majority of the tweets. In addition, the general community was the most targeted public of the tweets, while self-promotion was the most featured theme of the tweets. When analyzing the individual tweets, it was confirmed that many colleges and universities are not following the most-commonly accepted relationship-building strategies, such as dialogic and two-way communication. As one of the first studies of its kind, this dissertation offers insight into how colleges and universities are using Twitter to communicate and build relationships with their key publics. It extends upon the existing knowledge of how social media, such as Twitter, can be used in a dialogic public relations context. Furthermore, it offers insight into how Twitter can be used in collaboration with traditional public relations theories, such as the four models of public relations. It concludes with implications of how colleges and universities can use Twitter to build and maintain mutually-beneficial relationships.;1461742910;Dissertations & Theses;;Beverly, Jason Antwuan;;;" Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.";; Dissertation/Thesis;; 2013; 978-1-303-57860-1;;; English; English;;;2013;ProQuest Dissertations and Theses;2013;;https://search.proquest.com/docview/1461742910?accountid=11774; 0459 Communication , 0558 Multimedia Communications , 0646 Web Studies , 0745 Higher education; 0459 Communication , 0558 Multimedia Communications , 0646 Web Studies , 0745 Higher education;; 0459 Communication , 0558 Multimedia Communications , 0646 Web Studies , 0745 Higher education;;; 0459 Communication , 0558 Multimedia Communications , 0646 Web Studies , 0745 Higher education; Communication , Multimedia Communications , Web Studies , Higher education; Communication and the arts , Education , Dialogic communication , Higher education public relations , Public relations models , Social media , Twitter , Two-way public relations;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:Social+Science+Database&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Public+relations+models+and+dialogic+communication+in+the+Twitterverse%3A+An+analysis+of+how+colleges+and+universities+are+engaging+their+public+through+Twitter&amp;issn=&amp;date=2013-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Beverly%2C+Jason+Antwuan&amp;isbn=978-1-303-57860-1&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/";ProQuest Central,Social Science Premium Collection
A Characterization of the Communication Preferences for Nonprofit Organizations during a Phenomenological Study of a Virtual World Meeting;With the weakening economy, many nonprofit organizations have cut their budget and are investigating cost cutting expenditures to survive from cutting employees, to cutting services, to cutting business travel. Several industry challenges have resulted in reduced business activity. Increased demands have required practitioners to be innovative in meeting business needs. In response, some companies have adopted information technology solutions. This research is a characterization of the communication preferences for nonprofit organizations during a phenomenological study of a virtual world meeting. There has been a limited amount of formal research regarding the efficacy of virtual meetings over meetings in a real world setting and recommendations for future research in virtual worlds are offered in the conclusion.

Role of online teaching experience in pedagogical innovation in LIS education: An activity-theoretical analysis;"The study explored the role of online teaching experience in pedagogical innovation in the area of Library and Information Science (LIS) education. Based on the data from interviews with 25 LIS faculty who have relevant experience and from the syllabi for their courses, the study provides evidence that transitioning courses to online modality leads faculty to incorporate new teaching methods, technology tools and resources into their overall pedagogical repertoire. The study applied Activity Theory framework in a novel way to conduct multi-level analysis of the teaching activity with attention to both activity structure and its context. Both individual and institutional cases are described in detail, using unified Activity Theory-based vocabulary. This analytical approach allowed the discussion of individual and institutional factors that drive pedagogical innovation. The study links innovation to changes in actions that comprise the teaching activity and suggests that innovative pedagogies are more likely to develop in the context of asynchronous online teaching. The study findings paint a rich picture of teaching activity continuously evolving through instructional mode changes. Common paths as well as variations are described, including discussion of pros and cons of online and face-to-face teaching and the ways they can be combined in various hybrid (""blended"") instruction models for optimal teaching and learning experience. The analytical separation of individual and contextual factors provided foundation for recommendations for practice aimed at both individual instructors and academic institutions.";1438851779;Dissertations & Theses;;Khanova, Julia;;;" Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.";; Dissertation/Thesis;; 2013; 978-1-303-35668-1;;; English; English;;;2013;ProQuest Dissertations and Theses;2013;;https://search.proquest.com/docview/1438851779?accountid=11774; 0710 Educational technology , 0723 Information science , 0745 Higher education; 0710 Educational technology , 0723 Information science , 0745 Higher education;; 0710 Educational technology , 0723 Information science , 0745 Higher education;;; 0710 Educational technology , 0723 Information science , 0745 Higher education; Educational technology , Information science , Higher education; Communication and the arts , Education , Higher education , Library and Information Science (LIS) , Online , Pedagogical innovation;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:Education+Database&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Role+of+online+teaching+experience+in+pedagogical+innovation+in+LIS+education%3A+An+activity-theoretical+analysis&amp;issn=&amp;date=2013-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Khanova%2C+Julia&amp;isbn=978-1-303-35668-1&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/";ProQuest Central,Social Science Premium Collection
Creating Computer Simulations In Middle Grades Mathematics: A Study of a Technology-Integrated Statistics Curriculum;"This study examines two weeklong implementations of technology-enhanced mathematics units. Pre and post-survey data, student interviews, audio and video recordings of classroom sessions, and participation log data were collected and analyzed using quantitative and qualitative methods. Constructs measured included self-efficacy in mathematics and computers, triggered and maintained interest, future pursuits, and engagement. Survey constructs were verified using factor analysis procedures, and t-tests and effect sizes were calculated for pre and post-survey differences of means. Further analysis using ANCOVA and mixed ANOVA procedures examined constructs and sub-populations flagged as potentially having statistically significant differences of means. No statistically significant differences were found between pre and post-survey means for any construct or population of students. Students reported high self-efficacy and interest in both mathematics and computer use overall on both surveys. Analysis of interview and observation data found evidence of students' interest states shifting from triggered to maintained situational interest during the course of unit implementation. Students with repeated exposure to the Simulations in Statistics units were more likely to show evidence of transitioning interest states. Analysis of participation logs showed that, on average, students were highly engaged throughout the units. Engagement rates did not differ by gender, but the nature of engagement did. Female students engaged in more collaborative behavior, while male students engaged in more independent work and off-task behaviors. Two teachers simultaneously implemented the units in two separate computer labs. The learning environments in these two labs were different: one emphasized collaborative work and student self-directed use of online wiki and tutorial resources; the other teacher did not. In the collaborative focused lab, a larger percentage of behavior was on-task for all students, especially female students. The learning environment was critical to the engagement of female students. Latino/a students reported lower self-efficacy beliefs than white students especially in mathematics. Participation in these units gave students the opportunity to develop new self-efficacy beliefs in math and computer use in this context. These findings inform research efforts to increase interest and motivation for women and people of color to pursue STEM related careers.";1368244837;Dissertations & Theses;;Marshall, Krista Sekeres;;;" Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.";; Dissertation/Thesis;; 2013; 978-1-303-09417-0;;; English; English;;;2013;ProQuest Dissertations and Theses;2013;;https://search.proquest.com/docview/1368244837?accountid=11774; 0280 Mathematics education , 0710 Educational technology , 0733 Gender studies; 0280 Mathematics education , 0710 Educational technology , 0733 Gender studies;; 0280 Mathematics education , 0710 Educational technology , 0733 Gender studies;;; 0280 Mathematics education , 0710 Educational technology , 0733 Gender studies; Mathematics education , Educational technology , Gender studies; Social sciences , Education , Interest and engagement , Realistic mathematics education , Self-efficacy , Simulations and modeling , Statistics education , Women in stem;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:Education+Database&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Creating+Computer+Simulations+In+Middle+Grades+Mathematics%3A+A+Study+of+a+Technology-Integrated+Statistics+Curriculum&amp;issn=&amp;date=2013-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Marshall%2C+Krista+Sekeres&amp;isbn=978-1-303-09417-0&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/";ProQuest Central,Social Science Premium Collection
A Maturity Model for Online Classes across Academic Disciplines;The number of academic institutions offering courses online has increased with courses being offered across almost all academic disciplines. Faculty members are often confronted with the responsibility of converting a face-to-face course to an online course while simultaneously dealing with new technologies and the interrelationship between the technology, content, and pedagogy. Best instructional practices may be applied inconsistently in the online environment due to faculty members' lack of proficiency in implementing such practices. Although Course Management Systems and Web 2.0 technologies make the task seem less daunting, faculty members still need guidance in consistently implementing best practices in online courses. The study examined the problem of academic institutions offering online courses without any validation or tracking processes to ensure course quality. An online instructional maturity model was developed to guide faculty members in implementing learner-centered practices in online courses. Survey methodology was used to collect data on instructional practices being implemented in the North Carolina Community College System. The model was developed from the survey findings using guidelines from the American Psychological Association Learner-Centered Principles, best practices found in the literature, and the People Capability Maturity Model. Feedback from an expert panel was used to refine the model.;1367603745;Dissertations & Theses;;Neequaye, Barbara Burris;;;" Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.";; Dissertation/Thesis;; 2013; 978-1-303-09528-3;;; English; English;;;2013;ProQuest Dissertations and Theses;2013;;https://search.proquest.com/docview/1367603745?accountid=11774; 0710 Educational technology; 0710 Educational technology;; 0710 Educational technology;;; 0710 Educational technology; Educational technology; Education , Academic disciplines , Andragogy , Course quality , Higher education , Instructional maturity model , Learner-centered best practices , Online;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:Education+Database&amp;atitle=&amp;title=A+Maturity+Model+for+Online+Classes+across+Academic+Disciplines&amp;issn=&amp;date=2013-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Neequaye%2C+Barbara+Burris&amp;isbn=978-1-303-09528-3&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/";ProQuest Central,Social Science Premium Collection
Pedagogical significance of wikis: towards gaining effective learning outcomes;"  Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to explore the effectiveness and pedagogical implications of integrating wikis into the curriculum and the subsequent learning outcomes of a group of Net-Gens who enrolled in an International Marketing course. The research problem of the study is: ""What are the learning outcomes and pedagogical implications arising from the use of wikis?"" Design/methodology/approach - A qualitative research methodology supported by the NVivo data analysis software was employed. A triangulated approach to collecting data was used. First, the content of the three student-generated wikis and the written text of 30 student assignments were analysed by using Nvivo software to identify emerging themes pertaining to wiki-based learning outcomes. Second, a critical incident method was employed where students were asked to describe two positive experiences and two negative experiences related to the wiki pedagogy. Third, in-depth interviews were conducted with six members of the teaching panel of the course to further understand the pedagogical implications of wikis. Findings - Consistent with previous studies, it was found that wikis promoted collaborative learning, organic discussions and independent thinking. Against previous studies, however, it was found that students adapted to wiki-based pedagogy very well, and with little difficulty. There were differential levels of student engagement in wikis, and that occasionally wikis resulted in stagnated discussions, unless clearly aligned to the curriculum. Practical implications - A well thought-out alignment of wiki assessments with other learning activities has the potential to engage Net-Gens. In order to keep students enthusiastically engaged in wiki discussions, it is important to embed wiki-based activities into other learning activities. Understanding that there is a ""spill over"" effect from one learning activity to another is important. Social implications - The outcomes were especially beneficial to non-English speaking background (NESB) students who are often inhibited in their responses in typical classroom settings. Originality/value - While research has focussed on the use and functionality of wikis in curriculum design, there is a paucity of work on their pedagogical implications. This paper look sat the implications of a ""wiki-based pedagogy"" which assumes an ""emancipatory"", partially-""constructivist"" paradigm of learning, where teachers should be ready to 'loosen the controls of the conventional teaching-centred learning environment'.";1354936890;Scholarly Journals;;"Hewege, Chandana Rathnasiri;Liyanage Chamila Roshani Perera";;; Copyright Emerald Group Publishing Limited 2013; 10.1108/18363261311314953; Feature;; 2013;;2046-469X;1; English;; 51-70; Acton;2013;Journal of International Education in Business;2013;6;https://search.proquest.com/docview/1354936890?accountid=11774;;;;;; 51;; Teaching , Research & development--R&D , School environment , Core curriculum , Pedagogy , Educational technology , Interactive media;;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aabiglobal&amp;atitle=Pedagogical+significance+of+wikis%3A+towards+gaining+effective+learning+outcomes&amp;title=Journal+of+International+Education+in+Business&amp;issn=2046469X&amp;date=2013-01-01&amp;volume=6&amp;issue=1&amp;spage=51&amp;au=Hewege%2C+Chandana+Rathnasiri%3BLiyanage+Chamila+Roshani+Perera&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=Journal+of+International+Education+in+Business&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/10.1108%2F18363261311314953";ProQuest Central,Social Science Premium Collection
The impact of virtual reality programs in career and technical education;"Instructional technology has evolved from blackboards with chalk to in some cases three-dimensional virtual reality environments in which students are interacting and engaging with other students worldwide. The use of this new instructional methodology, known as ""virtual reality,"" has experienced substantial growth in higher education over the past few years. Unlike traditional learning environments, a virtual world provides students with the opportunity to take a distance-learning course while simultaneously developing a sense of virtual community with the other learners in the course. To that end, this descriptive research study was designed to examine virtual reality programs and their levels of impact in programs in career and technical education. Data was collected through in-depth phone and face-to-face interviews within two courses. Both courses were instructed in the exact same manner, however, one course was offered in a traditional online environment and the other course was offered in a virtual reality program called SecondLife. The research contained herein utilizes a qualitative methodology with data collected from interviews conducted. This study measured the impact of the integration of Second Life into career and technical courses using the following evaluative criteria: (1) Engagement (i.e. Will there be a significant difference in the level of engagement between courses which use Second Life and similar courses which do not?) and (2) academic success (i.e. Will there be a significant difference between the academic which use Second Life and similar courses which do not?) and (3) satisfaction (i.e. Will there be a significant difference in the level of satisfaction between students in courses which use Second Life and similar courses which do not? The research indicates that participants enrolled in the SecondLife learning environment experienced an increased level of engagement, academic success, and satisfaction. Findings also indicate that participants either enjoyed the virtual reality environment or they did not. The research found that there was very little middle ground in the results and participants were very one-sided towards one type of instruction compared to the other.";1315766280;Dissertations & Theses;;Catterson, Anna J.;;;" Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.";; Dissertation/Thesis;; 2013; 978-1-267-93368-3;;; English; English;;;2013;ProQuest Dissertations and Theses;2013;;https://search.proquest.com/docview/1315766280?accountid=11774; 0514 School administration , 0530 Teacher education , 0710 Educational technology , 0747 Vocational education; 0514 School administration , 0530 Teacher education , 0710 Educational technology , 0747 Vocational education;; 0514 School administration , 0530 Teacher education , 0710 Educational technology , 0747 Vocational education;;; 0514 School administration , 0530 Teacher education , 0710 Educational technology , 0747 Vocational education; School administration , Teacher education , Educational technology , Vocational education; Education , Career and technical education , Online , Second Life , Student academic success , Student engagement , Student satisfaction , Virtual reality;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:Education+Database&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+impact+of+virtual+reality+programs+in+career+and+technical+education&amp;issn=&amp;date=2013-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Catterson%2C+Anna+J.&amp;isbn=978-1-267-93368-3&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/";ProQuest Central,Social Science Premium Collection
Nursing students' educational benchmarks and outcomes: An examination of the differences based on residence;Living–learning communities have been shown to foster academic success. Nursing students have high attrition rates. Faculty want to help increase students' chances of success. Therefore, a study was designed to see if differences in academic outcomes could be measured between two groups of nursing students. The study undertaken was the first to explore the effect of residing in a multilevel living–learning community on nursing students' compared to a group residing in a traditional residence hall. The benchmarks of effective educational practices (academic challenge, active and collaborative learning, student–faculty interaction, enriching educational experiences, and supportive campus environment) were examined. Nursing and general course outcomes were also examined for differences in grade point average and rate of passing versus failure. Data were collected via the National Survey of Student Engagement. The total sample size for data analysis was N = 41, or a 32% participant response rate. A multivariate analysis of variance and chi-square were conducted to determine if there were differences by place of residence. Although the results were not statistically significant, it is essential to note that statistical significance should not be confused with scientific significance, and this is more true in educational research than in other disciplines. The results of this study might indicate that the two groups of students are more homogenous than heterogeneous, with similar experiences, which makes detecting differences between the two groups a more difficult task. Another consideration is that the effects of the living–learning community are possibly not directly measurable. Continued examination of variables that affect students' success is vital, and additional methods of measuring the effects of living–learning communities need to be considered.;1289102850;Dissertations & Theses;;Vincent, Debra A.;;;" Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.";; Dissertation/Thesis;; 2013; 978-1-267-89870-8;;; English; English;;;2013;ProQuest Dissertations and Theses;2013;;https://search.proquest.com/docview/1289102850?accountid=11774; 0515 Education , 0569 Nursing; 0515 Education , 0569 Nursing;; 0515 Education , 0569 Nursing;;; 0515 Education , 0569 Nursing; Education , Nursing; Health and environmental sciences , Education , Benchmarks , Community , Living-learning , Outcomes , Residence , Traditional;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:Education+Database&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Nursing+students%27+educational+benchmarks+and+outcomes%3A+An+examination+of+the+differences+based+on+residence&amp;issn=&amp;date=2013-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Vincent%2C+Debra+A.&amp;isbn=978-1-267-89870-8&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/";ProQuest Central,Social Science Premium Collection
The role of teacher's initiation in online pedagogy;"  Purpose - The author redesigned a course titled ""Applied Information Technology: Networking"" and applied online collaborative learning (CL) with initiation and self-regulated learning (SRL) to improve students' involvement in this course in an environment that is full of free online games, shopping websites, and social networking websites. The purpose of this paper is to explore the potential effects of online CL with initiation and SRL on students' involvement. Design/methodology/approach - This study designed an intervention of online CL with initiation and SRL to improve students' involvement and their learning in a blended course. It is believed that this article is important to the computing field and could provide insight for teachers to design their online courses and teaching methods. Findings - The author in this study adopted SRL in the implementation of online CL with initiation, and explored their effects on improving students' involvement. The results of this empirical study report that the effects of online CL with initiation and SRL were positive, and led to the best involvement in the blended course among the three classes. Research limitations/implications - The effects of online CL with initiation and SRL in this study were positive; however, problems of experimental validity may result from students in the comparison group being incidentally exposed to the treatment condition, having more enthusiastic teaching, being more motivated than students in the control group, etc. (Gribbons and Herman). Besides, some other contextual factors and individual behaviours might influence students' online learning effects. For example, students' adaptability to the online learning environments and their readiness for self-directed learning may result in the differences of the effects among the three groups (Shen, Lee and Tsai). Practical implications - The internet has enabled a shift from contiguous learning groups to asynchronous distributed learning groups utilizing computer-supported collaborative learning (CSCL) environments (Kreijns, Kirschner and Jochems). It is expected that the interventions of online teaching methods, course design, and learning activities in this study may provide a reference for teachers, particularly for blended learning computing courses. Social implications - The results of this study report that the effects of online CL with initiation and SRL were positive, and contributed to the best involvement in the blended course among the three classes. The author further discusses the implications for schools and teachers who plan to provide online or blended learning for their students. Originality/value - First, this study provides a scenario about how to help students collaborate and learn regularly, and improve their involvement in a blended course through online CL and SRL, particularly for computing courses. Second, this study specifies how teachers can provide initiation to help students climb the learning curve and overcome the bottlenecks typically encountered in the implementation of online CL. Third, this study is one of the first attempts to explore and demonstrate the effects of online CL with initiation and SRL in a blended course simultaneously.";1030154915;Scholarly Journals;;Chia-Wen Tsai; EDUTAK;; Copyright Emerald Group Publishing Limited 2012; 10.1108/00400911211254253; Feature;; 2012;;0040-0912;6; English;; 456-471; London;2012;Education & Training;2012;54;https://search.proquest.com/docview/1030154915?accountid=11774; 8306 Schools and educational services , 9130 Experimental/theoretical , 5250 Telecommunications systems & Internet communications , 9179 Asia & the Pacific; 8306 Schools and educational services , 9130 Experimental/theoretical , 5250 Telecommunications systems & Internet communications , 9179 Asia & the Pacific;; 8306 Schools and educational services , 9130 Experimental/theoretical , 5250 Telecommunications systems & Internet communications , 9179 Asia & the Pacific;; 456; 8306 Schools and educational services , 9130 Experimental/theoretical , 5250 Telecommunications systems & Internet communications , 9179 Asia & the Pacific; Studies , Learning , Distance learning , Problems , Teaching methods , Taiwan;;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aabiglobal&amp;atitle=The+role+of+teacher%27s+initiation+in+online+pedagogy&amp;title=Education+%26+Training&amp;issn=00400912&amp;date=2012-07-30&amp;volume=54&amp;issue=6&amp;spage=456&amp;au=Chia-Wen+Tsai&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=Education+%26+Training&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/10.1108%2F00400911211254253";ProQuest Central,SciTech Premium Collection,Social Science Premium Collection
Assessing Information Systems and Computer Information Systems Programs from a Balanced Scorecard Perspective;  Assessment of educational programs is one of the important means used in academia for accountability, accreditation, and improvement of program quality. The assessment practices, guidelines, and requirements are very broad and vary widely among academic programs and from one institution to the other. In this paper, from the theoretical lenses of a strategic planning and management methodology, the Balanced Scorecard, we try to integrate various perspectives into a performance assessment framework for an educational assessment of computing and information systems. Particularly, based on the actual accreditation experience, we propose two assessment models: a conceptual model and a process model. This modeling approach addresses the critical conceptual elements required for educational assessment and provides practical guidelines to follow for a complete, smooth and successful assessment process. In addition, we present a set of robust tools and techniques, incorporated into the process steps, team work, and task-driven management process. We were successful in our accreditation efforts, and improved the quality of our computing and information systems programs by using these presented assessment methods. We share our views and thoughts in the form of lessons learned and suggested best practices so as to streamline program assessment and simplify its procedures and steps.

A Community of Practice Approach to Learning Programming;In programming courses, teaching students who have varied levels of knowledge and skills the requisite competencies to perform in real-world software development teams is indeed difficult. To address this problem, this paper proposes a community of practice (CoP) approach and provides some guidelines to simulate a real-world CoP in a blended learning environment. It simulates not only the role structure and tasks but also the participation process. The design of this approach is based on the situated learning perspective that considers learning to be a trajectory in which learners move from legitimate peripheral participation to full participation in CoPs. The results from the data analysis and questionnaires indicated that the students were very engaged in this activity and believed that this approach helped them to develop necessary programming knowledge and skills. This study also reports certain constraints and suggestions for teachers who want to adapt this approach for their courses.

Grooming a new team with possible roles using the Scrum practices;  The Scrum, an agile development process allows quickly production of working piece of product by undergoing the development into small release cycles and in improvement ways. There is a growing demand to expose students to such practices. In the same time students also need to practice the possible roles that they will get when they join a real life project or an industry. Exercising the Scrum practices may help the students to learn and practice the possible roles to perform during a project. During a cycle of scrum called 'sprint retrospective', the team dedicated time to deliberately reflect how they are doing and to find ways to improve. The scrum team will be constantly looking for improving opportunities either for the product builds or the practices they chosen. In this paper, we discuss our experiences in practising the Scrum practices in students' development of final year projects. This may be very useful to the final year students and new recruitments whose are on job training.;1443717973;Scholarly Journals;;Kaliba, Syed Ibrahim;;; Copyright International Journal of Advanced Research in Computer Science Mar 2012;; Journal Article;; Mar 2012;;;2; English; English;; Udaipur;Mar 2012;International Journal of Advanced Research in Computer Science;2012;3;https://search.proquest.com/docview/1443717973?accountid=11774;;;;;; n/a;;;;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Ahightechjournals&amp;atitle=Grooming+a+new+team+with+possible+roles+using+the+Scrum+practices&amp;title=International+Journal+of+Advanced+Research+in+Computer+Science&amp;issn=&amp;date=2012-03-01&amp;volume=3&amp;issue=2&amp;spage=&amp;au=Kaliba%2C+Syed+Ibrahim&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=International+Journal+of+Advanced+Research+in+Computer+Science&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/";ProQuest Central,SciTech Premium Collection

Wikis in Teaching: An Experiment with WikiHaskell and StatMediaWiki: Revista de Universidad y Sociedad del Conocimiento Revista de Universidad y Sociedad del Conocimiento;  This article presents WikiHaskell, a project based on wiki technologies developed on the Computer Engineering degree course at the University of Cadiz. WikiHaskell is a wiki for which students, organised into groups of three, create complementary materials on Haskell programming language libraries. The main objective of this project is to introduce open knowledge creation into the classroom, thus turning the students into the true protagonists of the course subject. To assess the wiki and, therefore, the work done by the students, StatMediaWiki was developed. This is a statistical analysis system for MediaWiki wikis that allows such assessments to be performed both easily and transparently. StatMediaWiki generates an overall report of the wiki and individual analyses of the work done by user, by page and by category. In the experiment described, StatMediaWiki's analysis of the time distribution of the students' contributions allowed a range of user profiles to be identified. likewise, by-category analysis allowed certain situations within a group to be detected, such as the identification of the lead students or the less active ones. Both the wiki content and the StatMediaWiki code are open source and publicly accessible.

Marketing through online leadership to retain invisible customers: Perceptions of online students;"This quantitative study examined the relationship between student perceived leadership styles of online university instructors, and the perceived customer satisfaction and retention of online students. Specifically, the four goals of this study were to determine: (a) students' perception of their online instructor's leadership style, (b) if students were satisfied with their online course, (c) if students intended to take other online courses from the studied university, and (d) if there was a relationship between the students' perception of their online instructor's leadership style and the students' satisfaction with their current online course and their desire to take more online courses at the studied university. The conceptual framework of this descriptive study, which used quantitative survey methodology, was based upon the Multifactor Leadership Questionnaire (Form 5x-Short; MLQ-5X) by Avolio and Bass (2004). The survey instrument focused on the nine MLQ leadership styles in the online course room environment. A total of 83 surveys were used to calculate the results of this study, which was conducted at a for-profit institution of higher learning in a southeastern state of the U.S. The study results indicate that the four MLQ leadership styles most strongly associated with satisfaction and retention are idealized influence attributed (IA), intellectual stimulation (IS), individual consideration (IC), and contingent reward (CR). Moderating variables were found to be PC skill, Internet skill, and skill with the online course room platform. Findings are consistent with existing literature. The researcher suggests that this study be repeated at public institutions and include English-Second-Language (ESL) as a moderating variable.";921919903;Dissertations & Theses;;Kibiloski, F.

Promoting Learning of Instructional Design via Overlay Design Tools;I begin by introducing Virtual Design Apprenticeship (VDA), a learning model — built on a solid foundation of education principles and theories — that promotes learning of design skills via overlay design tools. In VDA, when an individual needs to learn a new design skill or paradigm she is provided accessible, concrete examples that have been annotated with design rationale. These annotations make expert thinking visible and allow the novice to immediately use, and gradually understand, new best practices. By combining abstract rationale with concrete design instances, annotated artifacts become more useful than either could be alone. I describe the essential components of the VDA framework: annotated design artifacts, a repository of carefully chosen annotated examples, and a community of experts and learners. I walk the reader through an example of how VDA scaffolds learners as they move from a novice's understanding of a design space towards that of an expert. Within the context of this example, I present a set of design principles that guide the creation of VDA design tools — user interfaces built to mediate an individual's interactions with the three core VDA components. While VDA is applicable to most design fields, I narrow the scope of consideration to one particular domain of design by focusing in-depth on the instructional design difficulties that university-level faculty members face and how the VDA approach can address them. These instructors face precisely the type of design paradigm shift that VDA was developed to ease as they attempt to move away from traditional, lecture-based pedagogical methods and towards more modern, learner-centered techniques. I engaged with these instructors and a curriculum design research group in a six-year period of contextual inquiry. Findings from this study influenced my formulation of the VDA framework and the design of PACT, a design tool that leverages the learning principle of making thinking visible to assist novices as they transition from concrete to abstract reasoning about curriculum design. The central focus of PACT is the incorporation of annotated references to pedagogical design patterns — abstract representations of best practices in instructional design. I discuss the iterative design and implementation of PACT in detail, highlighting the ways in which it embodies the VDA design principles for promoting learning of instructional design via overlay design tools. Next, I study the challenges of converting abstract best practices and design patterns into concrete annotations that can be applied directly to content. My solution, the PACT Annotation Schema, is a formal mechanism for generating tags and pattern annotations from freeform pattern text. Formal representations of patterns are far more useful than generic references, both as scaffolds for learning and for structuring user interactions with design artifacts. Using this schema, I have generated the PACT Annotation Library, a collection of 56 tags and 74 pattern annotations based on the work of the Pedagogical Patterns Project. Visual representations of these formal annotations are the centerpiece of PACT's user interface. The PACT tool was evaluated in two distinct stages. First, I present a formative study conducted with early, prototype versions of the PACT tool. This study examines the utility of PACT for expert curriculum designers and curriculum research groups, using a sample annotation process — and reflection on the outcomes of that process — to demonstrate that my approach is feasible and useful for those groups. I then present a summative user study of the utility of PACT for novice learner-centered curriculum designers. I demonstrate PACT's significant impact on how novice designers learn from expert-generated examples, how they perceive the credibility of those examples, and the quality of curriculum designs those novices can produce. These findings show that the VDA approach to learning works and that the PACT overlay curriculum design tool is a successful realization of VDA's design principles.

Learning to Define Lean Six Sigma Projects with Cases;  A low certification achievement rate (32%) was measured between 2007 and 2010 on the Lean Six Sigma Open Enrollment Certification Program at Tecnológico de Monterrey. The main cause of this problem was the failure to implement Lean Six Sigma theory into real life projects. 78% of the students that didn't complete a project were unable to fulfill the Definition Phase, which agrees what is commonly said that a well-defined project is a key factor to solve a problem. On the other hand, a research performed in 2010 revealed that key academic factors involved in the successful completion of Six Sigma projects were: (1) knowledge about tools used to define a project, (2) knowledge about Six Sigma basic concepts and (3) the Systemic view of the role of a Black Belt inside a company. One approach that is known to assist training programs by assessing educational elements, as the key factors mentioned above, is the Harvard Case Method. This paper proposes an adaptation of the Case Strategies into Lean Six Sigma training, specifically to create a tool to assist learning on how projects are defined, which is expected to lead into an increment of the rate of successful projects completion.

A meta-analytic review of cooperative learning practices in higher education: A human communication perspective;"The phrase cooperative learning refers to a pedagogical learning and teaching technique in use in schools from kindergarten through higher education. The technique involves the structuring of an active classroom environment with students working in groups to discover, solve, and at its basic, provide a framework for dialogue and conversation. Cooperative learning is grounded in the development of a theory of social interdependence (Morton Deutsch) which states that individuals, working in groups, can in most cases provide for greater productivity and ideas than individuals working alone. The development of cooperative learning was greatly expanded in the late 1960's and early 1970's with the invention of specific group learning techniques led by researchers David and Robert Johnson (Learning Together), Elliot Aronson (Jigsaw), and Robert Slavin (STAD). These researchers established guidelines (rules) and taxonomies that provided a basis for research in the area of cooperative learning. At the center of all of these techniques is an element of human communication, most often through the oral/aural communication channel, where group learning and discovery takes place. Cooperative learning and collaborative learning techniques differ in the amount and implementation of teaching guidelines required in the methodology. This study (a meta-analysis) weaves through more than 14-hundred published pieces of literature in a variety of disciplines, narrowing it down to 19 published articles which investigate (through experiments) the effectiveness through learning outcomes of cooperative learning in higher education (college and university level). With studies including more than 2-thousand student-participants in the research, data indicates no significant difference between those classrooms utilizing a cooperative learning format, and those using a traditional lecture/discussion format ( d = 0.05, 95%, C1:-05 to .14, p &gt;.05, k = 21, N = 2,052). Though there is no statistical difference between the two teaching techniques, researchers do offer a list of positive classroom observations/variables, which provides a launching point for future research into the use of cooperative learning techniques in higher education.";1112849655;Dissertations & Theses;;Huddy, William Patrick;;;" Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.";; Dissertation/Thesis;; 2012; 978-1-267-67528-6;;; English; English;;;2012;ProQuest Dissertations and Theses;2012;;https://search.proquest.com/docview/1112849655?accountid=11774; 0459 Communication , 0525 Educational psychology , 0745 Higher education; 0459 Communication , 0525 Educational psychology , 0745 Higher education;; 0459 Communication , 0525 Educational psychology , 0745 Higher education;;; 0459 Communication , 0525 Educational psychology , 0745 Higher education; Communication , Educational psychology , Higher education; Communication and the arts , Education , Communication , Cooperative learning , Public speaking;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:Social+Science+Database&amp;atitle=&amp;title=A+meta-analytic+review+of+cooperative+learning+practices+in+higher+education%3A+A+human+communication+perspective&amp;issn=&amp;date=2012-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Huddy%2C+William+Patrick&amp;isbn=978-1-267-67528-6&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/";ProQuest Central,Social Science Premium Collection
The impact of process on virtual teams: A comparative analysis of waterfall and agile software development teams;"Studies have shown that task type, social context, and time mediates virtual teams (Martins, Gilson, &amp; Maynard, 2004; Townsend, Hendrickson, &amp; DeMarie, 2002), yet no studies have been conducted comparing the process that the virtual teams are using to complete a task. Two global virtual teams from the same corporation who are using two different software development methodologies, waterfall and agile, were compared to understand the impact that process has on virtual teams. Interviews were conducted with both teams and their responses were coded using the constructs in Adaptive Structuration Theory. The results show that the software development process used by a virtual team does impact the team's culture, orientation toward change, and ultimately the quality of the product they are developing. Careful consideration should be made by software development organizations when deciding which development process they should deploy, given the important implications for virtual team dynamics and product outcomes.

Careful consideration should be made by software development organizations when deciding which development process they should deploy, given the important implications for virtual team dynamics and product outcomes.";1022640712;Dissertations & Theses;;Ashmore, Sondra;;;" Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.";; Dissertation/Thesis;; 2012; 978-1-267-39026-4;;; English; English;;;2012;ProQuest Dissertations and Theses;2012;;https://search.proquest.com/docview/1022640712?accountid=11774; 0454 Management , 0464 Computer Engineering , 0546 Industrial engineering , 0703 Organizational behavior; 0454 Management , 0464 Computer Engineering , 0546 Industrial engineering , 0703 Organizational behavior;; 0454 Management , 0464 Computer Engineering , 0546 Industrial engineering , 0703 Organizational behavior;;; 0454 Management , 0464 Computer Engineering , 0546 Industrial engineering , 0703 Organizational behavior; Management , Computer Engineering , Industrial engineering , Organizational behavior , Systems development , Virtual teams , Methods , Studies; Social sciences , Applied sciences , Adaptive structuration theory , Agile , Software development , Software engineering , Virtual teams , Waterfall;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ABI%2FINFORM+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+impact+of+process+on+virtual+teams%3A+A+comparative+analysis+of+waterfall+and+agile+software+development+teams&amp;issn=&amp;date=2012-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Ashmore%2C+Sondra&amp;isbn=978-1-267-39026-4&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/";ProQuest Central
Soft skills requirements in software development jobs: a cross-cultural empirical study;Purpose - Most of the studies carried out on human factor in software development concentrate primarily on personality traits. However, soft skills which largely help in determining personality traits have been given comparatively little attention by researchers. The purpose of this paper is to find out whether employers' soft skills requirements, as advertised in job postings, within different roles of software development, are similar across different cultures. Design/methodology/approach - The authors review the literature relating to soft skills before describing a study based on 500 job advertisements posted on well-known recruitment sites from a range of geographical locations, including North America, Europe, Asia and Australia. The study makes use of nine defined soft skills to assess the level of demand for each of these skills related to individual job roles within the software industry. Findings - It was found that in the cases of designer, programmer and tester, substantial similarity exists for the requirements of soft skills, whereas only in the case of system analyst is dissimilarity present across different cultures. It was concluded that cultural difference does not have a major impact on the choice of soft skills requirements in hiring new employee in the case of the software development profession. Originality/value - Specific studies concerning soft skills and software development have been sporadic and often incidental, which highlights the originality of this work. Moreover, no concrete work has been reported in the area of soft skills and their demand as a part of job requirement sets in diverse cultures, which increases the value of this paper.;1022551380;Scholarly Journals;;"Ahmed, Faheem;Capretz, Luiz Fernando;Bouktif, Salah;Campbell, Piers";;; Copyright Emerald Group Publishing Limited 2012; 10.1108/13287261211221137; Feature;; 2012;;1328-7265;1; English;; 58-81; Bingley;2012;Journal of Systems and Information Technology;2012;14;https://search.proquest.com/docview/1022551380?accountid=11774;;;;;; 58;; Studies , Software industry , Information technology , Software , Skills , Human resource management;;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Alibraryscience&amp;atitle=Soft+skills+requirements+in+software+development+jobs%3A+a+cross-cultural+empirical+study&amp;title=Journal+of+Systems+and+Information+Technology&amp;issn=13287265&amp;date=2012-01-01&amp;volume=14&amp;issue=1&amp;spage=58&amp;au=Ahmed%2C+Faheem%3BCapretz%2C+Luiz+Fernando%3BBouktif%2C+Salah%3BCampbell%2C+Piers&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=Journal+of+Systems+and+Information+Technology&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/10.1108%2F13287261211221137";ProQuest Central,SciTech Premium Collection,Social Science Premium Collection
Impact of Agile Software Development Model on Software Maintainability;"Software maintenance and support costs account for up to 60% of the overall software life cycle cost and often burdens tightly budgeted information technology (IT) organizations. Agile software development approach delivers business value early, but implications on software maintainability are still unknown. The purpose of this quantitative study was to better comprehend the impact of the Agile development approach on software maintainability. The study drew on resource dependence and Lehman's software evolution theories. The research questions for the study examined (a) the impact of the Agile software development model on software maintainability and its components- software analyzability, changeability, stability, and testability; and (b) the extent of the influence of the Agile approach, characterized by test-driven development, refactoring, continuous integration (CI) on software maintainability and its components in U.S.-based IT organization. Software source code data from a specific project were collected from 61 software iterations of software system developed using the Agile model. The quantitative study employed the analytic hierarchy process and multiple regression technique for data analysis. Results of this study revealed that the test-driven development explained 17% of variation, whereas refactoring accounted for 11% of variation in software maintainability. The CI factor was found to be statistically insignificant. This study contributes to positive social change by ascertaining the impact of Agile approach on software maintainability, further benefiting the Agile project management, Agile advocates, IT operation management, Agile practitioners, businesses adapting Agile development approach, and by contributing to the possible reduction in software maintenance efforts and cost due to improved software maintainability.";1018747342;Dissertations & Theses;;Gawali, Ajay R.;;;" Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.";; Dissertation/Thesis;; 2012; 978-1-267-34739-8;;; English; English;;;2012;ProQuest Dissertations and Theses;2012;;https://search.proquest.com/docview/1018747342?accountid=11774; 0454 Management , 0464 Computer Engineering , 0489 Information Technology; 0454 Management , 0464 Computer Engineering , 0489 Information Technology;; 0454 Management , 0464 Computer Engineering , 0489 Information Technology;;; 0454 Management , 0464 Computer Engineering , 0489 Information Technology; Management , Computer Engineering , Information Technology , Studies , Software engineering , Product development; Social sciences , Applied sciences , Agile software , Information technology , Maintainability , Management , Software development;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ABI%2FINFORM+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Impact+of+Agile+Software+Development+Model+on+Software+Maintainability&amp;issn=&amp;date=2012-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Gawali%2C+Ajay+R.&amp;isbn=978-1-267-34739-8&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/";ProQuest Central
The perception of teachers toward the use of mobile technology as a tool to engage students in learning;"The purpose of this study was to gauge the perception of teachers on the use of mobile technology, specifically cell phones, as an instructional tool to engage students in learning. Cell phones are the most ubiquitous piece of technology in the world. Their multiple functions can put the most up-to-date information at the fingertips of the user. However, schools have been slow to embrace these devices out of fear and ignorance on how to use their capabilities. Research is limited on this subject; most coming from cell phone manufacturers and related service providers. The opportunity to explore this technology tool as an instructional aid and provide educators with data to support the use of the cell phone in the classroom was both timely and evoking. The study queried 500 public school teachers in the Midwest on their proficiency with technology, their perception of the importance in using technology, their opinions on using technology in the classroom, and their specific integration of cell phones in their lessons. Of the respondents, 28.5% had experience using cell phones in the classroom. This was in comparison to national statistics of 75% of students having daily access to a phone. A Mann-Whitney U test found no significant difference between STEM teachers and teachers of other disciplines in their perceptions of the importance of using technology in the classroom. However, when conducting a t -test with the same two groups of teachers there was a significant difference in their ability to design and access lessons using technology. STEM teachers rated themselves at a higher skill level than did the teachers of other disciplines. A Pearson correlation examined the relationship between teacher comfort level with technology and the teacher's ability to design and access lessons using technology. A significant, positive relationship was found in that as the level of technology use increased the teacher ability to design and access lessons increased. With an r value of .742 this correlation was considered strong. The question posed was ""Are levels of student engagement different based on the frequency of integration of technology?"" Through the use of a one-way ANOVA there was no significant difference in student engagement based on the frequency of its use. A multiple regression was used to determine which of the nine proficiency indicators serve as predictors for student engagement. Two proficiencies, ""using software productivity tools"" and ""locating learning opportunities needed to advance my technology skills"" were both found to be significant negative predictors , and ""proficiency of troubleshooting problems that occur when using technology"" was a significant positive predictor of student engagement. Student engagement was discussed through the summary of experience responses of 44 teachers surveyed. These written responses provided depth to the study when investigating teacher perceptions of student engagement when cell phones are used as an instructional tool.";1015628727;Dissertations & Theses;;Goad, Kathryn Dawn;;;" Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.";; Dissertation/Thesis;; 2012; 978-1-267-32708-6;;; English; English;;;2012;ProQuest Dissertations and Theses;2012;;https://search.proquest.com/docview/1015628727?accountid=11774; 0449 Educational leadership , 0710 Educational technology; 0449 Educational leadership , 0710 Educational technology;; 0449 Educational leadership , 0710 Educational technology;;; 0449 Educational leadership , 0710 Educational technology; Educational leadership , Educational technology; Education , Apps , Cell phones , Mobile devices , Mobile learning , Student engagement;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:Publicly+Available+Content+Database&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+perception+of+teachers+toward+the+use+of+mobile+technology+as+a+tool+to+engage+students+in+learning&amp;issn=&amp;date=2012-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Goad%2C+Kathryn+Dawn&amp;isbn=978-1-267-32708-6&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/";ProQuest Central
Investigating Technical and Pedagogical Usability Issues of Collaborative Learning with Wikis;Wikis have been recently promoted as tools that foster collaborative learning. However, there has been little research devoted to the criteria that are suitable to address issues pertinent to collaborative learning. This paper proposes a set of criteria to explore technical and pedagogical usability issues of collaborative learning with wikis. The criteria are then used to evaluate students' collaborative writing activities. The units of study are wikis that groups of students developed collaboratively using MediaWiki. This paper also reports on technical and pedagogical implications for the use of wikis as collaborative learning tools in teacher education.

Influences of Teaching Approaches and Class Size on Undergraduate Mathematical Learning;  An issue for many mathematics departments is the success rate of precalculus students. In an effort to increase the success rate, this quantitative study investigated how class size and teaching approach influenced student achievement and students' attitudes towards learning mathematics. Students' achievement and their attitudes toward learning mathematics were compared across four treatments of a precalculus course. The four treatments were (a) traditional lecture-based structure, (b) traditional lecture- based structure with a reduced class size, (c) instruction that engaged students in problem solving, and (d) instruction that included opportunities for small collaborative groups. The achievement of students engaged in problem-based learning (PBL) was significantly higher than the other treatments. These findings suggest that undergraduates benefit from instruction that encourages reflection on prior knowledge while developing new ideas through problem solving. Surprisingly, students in the PBE treatment did not continue to outperform students in the other treatments in calculus. These findings suggest the need for longitudinal studies that investigate the long-term effect of teaching approach and small class size on student learning and student success in advanced mathematics courses.

Apply Student-Centered Learning on Computer Education;It has been long noticed that students are lacking the motivation for those type of teacher-centered learning environment. Student-Centered Learning (SCL) is used in the literature to indicate the shift of emphasis from the teacher to the student as the heart of the learning process. In this work we have discussed the methodology of SCL, presented our experience of applying SCL on computer education. Students play the active role in this process and take responsible for their own learning.

Does a Combination of Metaphor and Pairing Activity Help Programming Performance of Students with Different Self-Regulated Learning Level?;"This study aims to investigate the effects of metaphors and pairing activity on programming performance of students with different self-regulated-learning (SRL) level. A total of 84 computing students were involved in this seven-week study, and they were randomly assigned either to a group that received a combination of metaphor and pair programming (MPP) or to another group that received pair programming (PP) only. Students in both groups worked in pairs according to their SRL level (one high and one low) when solving programming problems in C++ language. The findings revealed that high SRL students in the MPP method performed significantly better in recall than their peers in the PP method, and similar result was observed among the low SRL students. However, no interaction effect was observed between the method and SRL level on programming performance, i.e., high SRL students always perform better either in the MPP or PP groups. Metaphors have assisted the learners to develop better conceptual understanding by linking the known to newly acquired abstracts; and pair programming does cultivate peer discussions. Also, instructor should assist students to improve their SRL to reinforce self learning.

Modifiers for Quality Assurance in Group Facilitation;  A key task of a professional facilitator is to assure the quality of the knowledge products created through collaborative effort. To manage the quality of the knowledge a group generates, facilitators attend to, judge, and question the quality of the contributions a group makes, the decisions it makes and the commitments its members make toward achieving the group's goals. When facilitators or group members detect deficiencies in ideas, decisions, agreements, or artifacts, facilitators may need to intervene to support the group in improving the quality of their output, without disrupting the flow of the group process. In this paper we present a framework for quality assessment and a toolbox with flexible interventions that can be added to a collaborative process on the fly as soon as quality deficiencies are detected. The toolbox is a set of conditional adjustment interventions that a facilitator can add to other facilitation techniques so as to guard the quality of the group's intellectual products. The toolbox can also be used as a starting point for designing intelligent agents that support the automatic detection of quality deficiencies.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT];884383552;Scholarly Journals;;"Kolfschoten, G L;Grünbacher, P;Briggs, R O";;; Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2011; 10.1007/s10726-011-9234-x; Feature;; Sep 2011;;0926-2644;5; English; English; 685-705; Dordrecht;Sep 2011;Group Decision and Negotiation;2011;20;https://search.proquest.com/docview/884383552?accountid=11774; 9130 Experimental/theoretical , 5240 Software & systems; 9130 Experimental/theoretical , 5240 Software & systems; References , Tables; 9130 Experimental/theoretical , 5240 Software & systems;; 685; 9130 Experimental/theoretical , 5240 Software & systems; Studies , Groups , Facilitated communication , Collaboration , Intelligent agents;;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aabiglobal&amp;atitle=Modifiers+for+Quality+Assurance+in+Group+Facilitation&amp;title=Group+Decision+and+Negotiation&amp;issn=09262644&amp;date=2011-09-01&amp;volume=20&amp;issue=5&amp;spage=685&amp;au=Kolfschoten%2C+G+L%3BGr%C3%BCnbacher%2C+P%3BBriggs%2C+R+O&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=Group+Decision+and+Negotiation&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/10.1007%2Fs10726-011-9234-x";ProQuest Central,Social Science Premium Collection
Constructivist-Based Framework for Teaching Computer Science;The business world is constantly evolving and is increasingly complex. Computer science graduates are expected to demonstrate competencies to efficiently solve business problems and communicate intelligently with IT professionals. However, education has been criticised for failing the task. The traditional method of teaching may not be appropriate for teaching computer science and meet the requirements of the business world. Constructivism provides an alternative foundation for rethinking and redesigning teaching practices. This paper proposes a constructivist-based framework for teaching computer science that exploits students' existing knowledge from real-life and explicitly addresses the process of knowledge construction. It eventually fosters further growth and development of the students' mind.

Education for the 21st Century;"  Making education pertinent to K-12 students in the 21st Century is a complex and important pursuit. For the past generation, while much of the educational system has not changed, teachers have been adapting to a new era by integrating new instructional methods and technologies into their classrooms. Efforts to make education relevant to 21st Century learners may be enhanced if a group of educational stakeholders, particularly educational technologists, could come to a consensus on issues concerning 21st Century skills, Information and Communication Technology (ICT) skills, teacher training, and school reform. This work sought to gain such a consensus through the results of a year-long Delphi study that involved six educational technologists. This paper reports on the Delphi study participants, methods, and results. Also, the researchers discuss each consensus reached by the panel of educational technologists relative to extant literature in order to highlight unique insights; to clarify ambiguities; and to reinforce effective practices.

Feminist Theory in Three Engineering Education Journals: 1995-2008;  Women remain underrepresented in engineering despite decades of effort. Feminist theory may explain why some well-intentioned efforts actually reinforce the very conditions they seek to change. Our purpose is to understand and advance the use of feminist theory in engineering education research towards the goals of increasing gender diversity and equity in engineering. Specifically, we seek to address the following questions: How has feminist theory been engaged within engineering education scholarship? And what opportunities exist for further engagement? We analyzed articles from Journal of Engineering Education (JEE), European Journal of Engineering (EJEE), and International Journal of Engineering Education (IJEE) that had women or gender as a central part of their studies. Tides, keywords, and abstracts for every article in the journals were reviewed for the years 1995-2008. The 88 articles directly addressing gender or women in engineering were analyzed to determine their level of engagement with feminist theory. Feminist theory is not widely engaged or systematically developed in this scholarship. Most work rests upon implicitly liberal and standpoint feminist theories, but a mino?ty of articles point to intersectional, interactional, and masculinity studies approaches. We identified several ways in which deeper engagement with a wider range of feminist theories can benefit engineering education scholarship. Feminist theory is underutilized within engineering education scholarship. Further engagement with, and systematic development of, feminist theory could be one beneficial way to move the field forward.;873571259;Scholarly Journals;;"Beddoes, Kacey;Borrego, Maura"; JEEDEQ;; Copyright AMERICAN SOCIETY FOR ENGINEERING EDUCATION Apr 2011;; Feature;; Apr 2011;;1069-4730;2; English; English; 281-303; Washington;Apr 2011;Journal of Engineering Education;2011;100;https://search.proquest.com/docview/873571259?accountid=11774;;; Diagrams , Tables , References;;; 281;; Feminism , Theory , Multiculturalism & pluralism , Engineering , Journals , Higher education;;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aeducation&amp;atitle=Feminist+Theory+in+Three+Engineering+Education+Journals%3A+1995-2008&amp;title=Journal+of+Engineering+Education&amp;issn=10694730&amp;date=2011-04-01&amp;volume=100&amp;issue=2&amp;spage=281&amp;au=Beddoes%2C+Kacey%3BBorrego%2C+Maura&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=Journal+of+Engineering+Education&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/";ProQuest Central,SciTech Premium Collection,Social Science Premium Collection

Assessing middle school student participation in online vs. face-to-face environments;"Educators have observed reluctance in middle school students to vocally engage in small group learning tasks, the result of which could be a decrease in student learning. The same students have been observed collaborating with peers outside of the classroom when using technology. The purpose of this study is to determine if technology provides a means to increase participation in the classroom, which in turn may increase student learning. Social constructivism and developmental theories guided this study. Eighty eighth-grade middle school students participated in a mixed-method, between-subject quasi-experiment to determine whether there was a difference in participation amount and content by students in small-group, learning-centered discussions using online vs. face-to-face environments. Students in groups of four used either an online chat tool or face-to-face discussion during a four-part activity. Data was coded, guided by Cohen's Kappa inter-rater reliability. The data was analyzed using independent sample t-tests, Fisher exact tests, relative percentage comparisons, Gini Coefficient comparisons, and Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon testing. Significant findings ( p &lt; .05, p &lt; .01) were demonstrated in participation amount, participation content, male participation amount, male participation content, and female participation content. Technology has the ability to enhance educational systems in order to prepare students to effectively and efficiently communicate and collaborate in today's high-tech environment. Accessing Web 2.0 tools in the classroom is a good first step as students can integrate their current out-of-school technological lifestyle and place it into the hands of educators to mold and form into quality 21 st century life skills.

Elementary Teachers' Perceptions of Technology Proficiencies and Motivation to Integrate Technology in School Curriculi;"Despite the availability of technological resources, the number of teachers integrating and using technology innovatively in the classroom is unknown. This qualitative investigation explored teachers' perceptions of proficiency in the use of computer technology in the classroom. Self-determination theory assisted the examination of motivation as decisions are made to integrate technology into the classroom curriculum. The research questions addressed the self-determination of teachers, decision making processes to integrate technology, and perceived technology competence. A qualitative, multiple case study design was used to explore the views of 10 technology-using elementary teachers in the use of technology in the classroom. These participants were interviewed, participated in a focus group, and submitted an integrated technology lesson plan. Data were analyzed using the constant comparative method. The results showed that teachers were found to be efficacious when incorporating technology into the curriculum and believed their actions could produce the desired results despite their technological skill level. Teachers were found to be self-determined and motivated to integrate technology; however, innovative practice was not evident while existing practice conformed to the instructional norms of the school. Implications for positive social change include allowing teachers to study current beliefs and practice, reflecting on best practices when integrating technology, and identifying technological innovation to enhance the learning of their own students. Recommendations include providing opportunities through professional development initiatives in which teachers and administrators alike study practice in collaborative ways, take ownership of instructional decisions, and take risks while integrating technology.";915789260;Dissertations & Theses;;Karl, Laura C.;;;" Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.";; Dissertation/Thesis;; 2011; 978-1-267-09259-5;;; English; English;;;2011;ProQuest Dissertations and Theses;2011;;https://search.proquest.com/docview/915789260?accountid=11774; 0710 Educational technology , 0727 Curriculum development; 0710 Educational technology , 0727 Curriculum development;; 0710 Educational technology , 0727 Curriculum development;;; 0710 Educational technology , 0727 Curriculum development; Educational technology , Curriculum development , Technology adoption , Elementary school teachers , Teacher attitudes; Education , Adult learners , Instructional strategies , Motivation , Self-efficacy , Technology integration , Technology proficiency;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:Education+Database&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Elementary+Teachers%27+Perceptions+of+Technology+Proficiencies+and+Motivation+to+Integrate+Technology+in+School+Curriculi&amp;issn=&amp;date=2011-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Karl%2C+Laura+C.&amp;isbn=978-1-267-09259-5&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/";ProQuest Central,Social Science Premium Collection
Examination of engineering design teacher self-efficacy and knowledge base in secondary technology education and engineering-related courses;There is an increasing demand for individuals with engineering education and skills of varying fields in everyday life. With the proper education students of high-needs schools can help meet the demand for a highly skilled and educated workforce. Researchers have assumed the supply and demand has not been met within the engineering workforce as a result of students' collegiate educational experiences, which are impacted by experiences in K-12 education. Although factors outside of the classroom contribute to the inability of universities to meet the increasing demand for the engineering workforce, most noted by researchers is the academic unpreparedness of freshman engineering students. The unpreparedness of entering freshman engineering students is a result of K-12 classroom experiences. This draws attention not only to the quality and competence of teachers present in the K-12 classroom, but the type of engineering instruction these students are receiving. This paper was an effort to systematically address one of the more direct and immediate factors impacting freshman engineering candidates, the quality of secondary engineering educators. Engineers develop new ideas using the engineering design process, which is taught at the collegiate level, and has been argued to be the best approach to teach technological literacy to all K-12 students. However, it is of importance to investigate whether technology educators have the knowledge and understanding of engineering design, how to transfer that knowledge in the classroom to students through instructional strategies, and their perception of their ability to do that. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to show the need for examining the degree to which technology and non-technology educators are implementing elements of engineering design in the curriculum.;913532016;Dissertations & Theses;;Vessel, Kanika Nicole;;;" Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.";; Dissertation/Thesis;; 2011; 978-1-267-06415-8;;; English; English;;;2011;ProQuest Dissertations and Theses;2011;;https://search.proquest.com/docview/913532016?accountid=11774; 0533 Secondary education , 0714 Science education , 0747 Vocational education; 0533 Secondary education , 0714 Science education , 0747 Vocational education;; 0533 Secondary education , 0714 Science education , 0747 Vocational education;;; 0533 Secondary education , 0714 Science education , 0747 Vocational education; Secondary education , Science education , Vocational education , Engineering , Knowledge , Educational technology; Education , Engineering education , Knowledge base , Self-efficacy , Technology education;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:Education+Database&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Examination+of+engineering+design+teacher+self-efficacy+and+knowledge+base+in+secondary+technology+education+and+engineering-related+courses&amp;issn=&amp;date=2011-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Vessel%2C+Kanika+Nicole&amp;isbn=978-1-267-06415-8&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/";ProQuest Central,Social Science Premium Collection
A survey of student, staff, and faculty perceptions of thirteen Pennsylvania state owned libraries using the LibQUAL+™ protocol;The purpose of this study was to explore user satisfaction of library services at 13 academic libraries in Pennsylvania. Using a mixed-methods approach, the researcher studied the results of a 27 question web-based survey known as LibQUAL+™ in this investigation. The survey contained three sub categories: Affect of Service, Information Control, and Library as Place. Participants included faculty, staff, and students from 13 Pennsylvania colleges, and responses were analyzed by gender, age, academic status, and academic major. The study also examined whether service quality scores of the three sub categories from the LibQUAL+™ instrument were related to total allocated library budget. An analysis of respondent comments was also conducted in order to see if the qualitatively analyzed survey comments and the quantitative LibQUAL+™ Scores were similar. All groups had positive LibQUAL+™ sub category scores. Library allocated budget seems to have little, or no effect on the three LibQUAL+™ sub category scores. Respondents' comments seem to support the results of the quantitative data analysis. However, the respondent comments should be viewed as a separate data source and show the most promise for details about any user dissatisfaction. Implications for future research and recommendations for future practice are included in the study. Further research on a larger more representative sample and replicating some aspects of this study on an individual question level rather than by sub category is recommended.;913400993;Dissertations & Theses;;Martin, Basil D., II;;;" Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.";; Dissertation/Thesis;; 2011; 978-1-267-06998-6;;; English; English;;;2011;ProQuest Dissertations and Theses;2011;;https://search.proquest.com/docview/913400993?accountid=11774; 0399 Library science , 0446 Higher Education Administration , 0449 Educational leadership; 0399 Library science , 0446 Higher Education Administration , 0449 Educational leadership;; 0399 Library science , 0446 Higher Education Administration , 0449 Educational leadership;;; 0399 Library science , 0446 Higher Education Administration , 0449 Educational leadership; Library science , Higher Education Administration , Educational leadership; Communication and the arts , Education , Academic libraries , Libqual , Library satisfaction , Service quality , Survey research;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:Library+Science+Database&amp;atitle=&amp;title=A+survey+of+student%2C+staff%2C+and+faculty+perceptions+of+thirteen+Pennsylvania+state+owned+libraries+using+the+LibQUAL%2B%E2%84%A2+protocol&amp;issn=&amp;date=2011-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Martin%2C+Basil+D.%2C+II&amp;isbn=978-1-267-06998-6&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/";ProQuest Central,Social Science Premium Collection
It takes a community to change a broken system: Using an inter-organizational collaborative group to help ensure all Oakland students graduate from high school;This qualitative study documents the formation and interactions of an inter-organizational collaborative group, Oakland's Promise Alliance, to determine if there were environmental and community factors that contributed to the success of the collaborative. The research examines how various participatory activities and group interactions used during the relationship-building phase of the groups' development helped strengthen the group over time. Lastly this study identifies the specific, preexisting characteristics of the Oakland community that affect the propensity for change. Employing the participatory action research method, 9 of the 13 members of the executive committee voluntarily participated in qualitative interviews and group dialogue to extract their sentiments toward the practice of collaboration in general and in Oakland specifically. I used the social capital theory as the theoretical rationale to examine the experiences the co-researchers have as members of Oakland's Promise Alliance and the external factors that influence the work. A summary of findings included the development of 4 generative themes: (a) Commitment, (b) Cohesion, (c) Change, and (d) Communication. The research reveals that all members were highly motivated to participate. Yet, contrary to previous studies on the leadership within the collaborative practice, co-researchers, who were executive committee members of an Oakland, California based nonprofit organization expressed the desire to have formalized leadership structure. Co-researchers also found that the key to Oakland's Promise Alliance's success lies within its opportunities to improve communication and engage in informal interactions. The retreat, held in Hershey, PA was an example of such. Recommendations for further research, as well as recommendations for inter-organizational collaboration are provided.;906771434;Dissertations & Theses;;DeWitt, Nyeisha T.;;;" Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.";; Dissertation/Thesis;; 2011; 978-1-267-00235-8;;; English; English;;;2011;ProQuest Dissertations and Theses;2011;;https://search.proquest.com/docview/906771434?accountid=11774; 0533 Secondary education , 0635 Organization Theory , 0703 Organizational behavior; 0533 Secondary education , 0635 Organization Theory , 0703 Organizational behavior;; 0533 Secondary education , 0635 Organization Theory , 0703 Organizational behavior;;; 0533 Secondary education , 0635 Organization Theory , 0703 Organizational behavior; Secondary education , Organization Theory , Organizational behavior , Community colleges , Collaborative learning , High school graduates; Education , Social sciences , California , Graduation , Interorganizational collaboration , Multisector collaboration , Oakland;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:Education+Database&amp;atitle=&amp;title=It+takes+a+community+to+change+a+broken+system%3A+Using+an+inter-organizational+collaborative+group+to+help+ensure+all+Oakland+students+graduate+from+high+school&amp;issn=&amp;date=2011-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=DeWitt%2C+Nyeisha+T.&amp;isbn=978-1-267-00235-8&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/";ProQuest Central,Social Science Premium Collection
The true cost of pair programming: Development of a comprehensive model and test;To advance the nomological net and theory, this dissertation proposed a comprehensive pair programming research model where the relationships among system complexity, programming methods, pair composition, effort, duration, defect rate, knowledge transfer, and various cost constructs were investigated. A multi-method, multi-study empirical approach was adopted. The survey method was employed for Study 1, and the bootstrap simulation method for Study 2. The responses from 191 industry software developers and the simulation results suggest the previous conclusions regarding pair programming are limited in nature and the pair programming approach may not be as desirable in all situations as was previously assumed. The pair programming approach clearly adds value in situations where it is appropriate but certain conditions must be met for this goal to be achieved. Pair composition must be taken into account, and it is important to examine the interactions of multiple cost factors such as defect, effort, duration, and knowledge transfer and consider their combined effect on the ultimate goal of the project.;900728273;Dissertations & Theses;;Sun, Wenying;;;" Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.";; Dissertation/Thesis;; 2011; 978-1-124-93733-5;;; English; English;;;2011;ProQuest Dissertations and Theses;2011;;https://search.proquest.com/docview/900728273?accountid=11774; 0454 Management , 0984 Computer science; 0454 Management , 0984 Computer science;; 0454 Management , 0984 Computer science;;; 0454 Management , 0984 Computer science; Management , Computer science , Studies; Social sciences , Applied sciences , Cost , Effort , Knowledge transfer , Pair composition , Pair programming , System complexity;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ABI%2FINFORM+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+true+cost+of+pair+programming%3A+Development+of+a+comprehensive+model+and+test&amp;issn=&amp;date=2011-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Sun%2C+Wenying&amp;isbn=978-1-124-93733-5&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/";ProQuest Central
The emergent and sustainable nature of leadership studies;Over the past two decades there has been a dramatic increase in the number of leadership programs offered throughout higher education institutions in the United States. Among these programs is the undergraduate degree granting Leadership Studies major. The purpose of this multiple case study was to explore the emergence and sustainability of degree granting undergraduate Leadership Studies majors. The research examined six degree granting leadership studies programs. A cross case analysis was completed on the programs utilizing the International Leadership Association's Guiding Questions: Guidelines for Leadership Education Programs . The five major categories covered in the Guiding Questions: Guidelines for Leadership Education Programs encompass (a) conceptual framework, (b) context, (c) content, (d) teaching and learning, and (e) assessments. The categories, general guiding questions, and specific questions, proposed in the Guiding Question document, were used to form the research questions for this study. The research findings are organized into the five Guiding Questions categories and the lens of complexity science is utilized to better understand Leadership Studies as a complex adaptive system within higher education. Findings contribute to the field of leadership studies by addressing the emergence of degree granting leadership studies programs and identifying how each of these programs maintains success. While the focus of the present study is limited to the six undergraduate leadership studies programs, the results may be beneficial to the development, delivery, and assessment of future degree granting leadership studies programs. Finally, the current study attends to gaps in the current body of knowledge on degree granting leadership studies programs and helps to establish leadership studies as a legitimate academic discipline within higher education.;887896092;Dissertations & Theses;;Sowcik, Matthew;;;" Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.";; Dissertation/Thesis;; 2011; 978-1-124-84345-2;;; English; English;;;2011;ProQuest Dissertations and Theses;2011;;https://search.proquest.com/docview/887896092?accountid=11774; 0449 Educational leadership , 0745 Higher education; 0449 Educational leadership , 0745 Higher education;; 0449 Educational leadership , 0745 Higher education;;; 0449 Educational leadership , 0745 Higher education; Educational leadership , Higher education , Professional development , Studies , Sustainability management , Education; Education , Leadership programs;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:Education+Database&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+emergent+and+sustainable+nature+of+leadership+studies&amp;issn=&amp;date=2011-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Sowcik%2C+Matthew&amp;isbn=978-1-124-84345-2&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/";ProQuest Central,Social Science Premium Collection
"How Students Experience &lt;i&gt;Teach One Another&lt;/i&gt; Activities in Online Courses at Brigham Young University-Idaho";As online learning enrollments rapidly increase, it is vital to explore effective course designs that deepen students' learning experiences. This multiple-case study explores four online courses at Brigham Young University-Idaho that include learning activities where students learned through Teach One Another activities. Teach One Another is similar to Reciprocal Peer Learning where students simultaneously learn and contribute to their peers' learning. Findings across the cases of this study show that Teach One Another activities in online courses encourage students to be accountable and motivated to complete individual course work as well as group assignments. As students learn to build trusting learning relationships, group activities may deepen students' learning experiences. This study discusses implications for online course designers, developers, and administrators who are interested in giving students opportunities to deepen their learning of the content and develop life skills such as accountability, responsibility, and trust.;882863432;Dissertations & Theses;;Holt, Joshua Alan;;" Brigham Young University

Group collaborative computer programming with the aid of a robot: Discovery-based learning;"The notion of discovery-based learning began in the early sixties (Bruner, 1961). Discovery-based learning has been considered an effective form of inquiry instruction particularly in a group learning environment because it allows students to construct knowledge by learning collaboratively from each other, become more active in the learning process, and gain ownership of their own learning (Bruner, 1961; Barkley, Cross, &amp; Major, 2005; Bell, 2003). This type of learning is not only meaningful learning it promotes lasting knowledge (Bruner, 1961; Barkley, Cross, &amp; Major, 2005; Denzin &amp; Lincoln, 1998). However, its effectiveness remains controversial (Louis, 2010; Ramadhan, 2000). While teacher-led pedagogies dominate computer-programming research literature, this study sought to explore the influence of a group discovery-based pedagogy. This study provided a bridge between learning about computer programming and discovery based learning. Additionally, this study sought to expose the benefits of learning about computer programing with the aid of a novel learning platform, a robot. While working in small groups, forty students of two sections of an introductory computer course were observed and videotaped during a two-week computer programming learning activity. The goal of the learning activity was to have student groups “discover” computer programming concepts while attempting to program a robot to solve a problem. The primary sources of research data were 900 minutes of group observation videotapes, over 100 participant interview transcriptions, and participant reflection papers. Carspecken's (1996) methods were used for data coding. Data analysis netted five emergent themes which defined students' characteristics and behaviors from learning in such an environment, namely, (1) frustrations from engaging with the learning aids, the robot and its remote controller, (2) frustrations from trying to understand the subject matter, computer programming, particularly modular programming, (3) prematurely celebrating success because they did not know what success really looked like, (4) not staying on course of the stated lab objective because they wanted to be more creative, to be challenged, and (5) dealing with adversity in team mates' work ethic while constructing computer programming knowledge collaboratively. Based on findings and literature, this study provided strategic recommendations on how to mitigate the five aforementioned behaviors to further enhance learning in a group-collaborative discovery learning environment. Findings and recommendations from this study could be used by educators to implement a discovery-based pedagogical environment in their classroom, perhaps as a first course in computer programming. Findings could also provide a framework for future research. What is unknown is how much knowledge actually transferred in this discovery-based knowledge transference environment? Further research might provide validation of the effectiveness of the use of a group-collaborative, discovery-based knowledge transference environment on learning outcomes.";880288553;Dissertations & Theses;;Earle, Maria T.;;;" Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.";; Dissertation/Thesis;; 2011; 978-1-124-73751-5;;; English; English;;;2011;ProQuest Dissertations and Theses;2011;;https://search.proquest.com/docview/880288553?accountid=11774; 0456 Pedagogy , 0710 Educational technology , 0727 Curriculum development; 0456 Pedagogy , 0710 Educational technology , 0727 Curriculum development;; 0456 Pedagogy , 0710 Educational technology , 0727 Curriculum development;;; 0456 Pedagogy , 0710 Educational technology , 0727 Curriculum development; Pedagogy , Educational technology , Curriculum development , Computer programming , Collaborative learning; Education , Collaboration , Computer programming , Discovery learning , Qualitative , Robot , Scaffolding;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:Education+Database&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Group+collaborative+computer+programming+with+the+aid+of+a+robot%3A+Discovery-based+learning&amp;issn=&amp;date=2011-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Earle%2C+Maria+T.&amp;isbn=978-1-124-73751-5&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/";ProQuest Central,Social Science Premium Collection
The Interconnectedness of Linguistics and Grammar: An In-Class Lab Instructional SMART Model;Effective developmental English instruction for community college students that incorporates rigor and cooperative learning functions during classroom instruction to produce skill set mastery is the focus of this study. The hypothesis of this quantitative research is that developmental English coursework is deficient in the mastery learning of grammatical language structures because the course lacks rigorous in-class cooperative practices, as well as meaningful instructional content (H 1). Thus, when designing this inclass lab instructional SMART model I was inspired by an outstanding selection of scholars who provided guidance for the learning framework. Gagne’, Wagner, Golas, and Keller’s (2005) systematic instructional design process, Bloom’s Taxonomy (1956, 1976), Carroll’s (1963) mastery learning model, and Tyler’s basic principles of curriculum and instruction provide guidance for the small unit of instruction lab process. Its lab components are well integrated, accommodate diversity, and incorporate critical thinking and active learning techniques as suggested by Boylan (2002). Additionally, Adelman (1996) noted developmental course participation by the underprepared student was a strong factor in degree completion. Two methods of inquiries implemented that pertained to meaningful content and skill set mastery with rigor and fun were (a) a three-part Survey Monkey link questionnaire comprised of five questions in each part, and (b) a Developmental English Teacher-Student Achievement (DETA) Three-Question Survey. The DETA survey asked faculties to comment on their delivery of instruction experiences. The survey questionnaires were sent out to randomly select English instructors via their faculty emails. In brief, the findings noted that 66.7% of faculty strongly agreed that task engagement, in unison with rigor and interactive learning, promoted holistic learning. Likewise, 87.5% agreed that a lesson on how and when to use demonstratives (this/that or these/those) was necessary. Additionally, 88.89% supported the early organization of lecture content followed by meaningful categorizations of group concerns to maintain a clear focal point when using various task and activities. Surprisingly, 100% agreed that direction instruction was appropriate when teaching on a specific mode of discourse to develop concepts. Overall, this study provided a schema for composition instruction to facilitate increased knowledge of the academic writing process.

Profiling of project managers for project success;This study is an investigation into the correlation between information technology (IT) project managers' backgrounds and project success. The focus was on five background predictors, namely, academic degree (i.e., in the arts or sciences), emotional intelligence (EQ), cultural intelligence, age, and gender. However, only EQ was found to correlate significantly with project success (.39) under both simple correlation and multiple linear regression analysis. Participants were from the United States and were project managers certified by the Project Management Institute. Based on previous studies, up to 70% of IT projects failed, which represented a detrimental cost to organizations. This study's correlational results added to the knowledge for mitigating the high failure rate. A recommendation is for employers and leaders of organizations to investigate directly the potential causal contributions of EQ in their ranks, especially with regard to recruitment, leadership, and performance success of IT project managers.;873970482;Dissertations & Theses;;Wu, Ray M.;;;" Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.";; Dissertation/Thesis;; 2011; 978-1-124-70495-1;;; English; English;;;2011;ProQuest Dissertations and Theses;2011;;https://search.proquest.com/docview/873970482?accountid=11774; 0454 Management , 0489 Information Technology; 0454 Management , 0489 Information Technology;; 0454 Management , 0489 Information Technology;;; 0454 Management , 0489 Information Technology; Management , Information Technology , Studies , Project management; Social sciences , Applied sciences , Cultural intelligence , Emotional intelligence , General mental ability , Information technology , Project Management Institute , Project management;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ABI%2FINFORM+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Profiling+of+project+managers+for+project+success&amp;issn=&amp;date=2011-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Wu%2C+Ray+M.&amp;isbn=978-1-124-70495-1&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/";ProQuest Central
Integrating Science and Mathematics Instruction in a Middle School STEM Course: The Impact on Attitudes, Career Aspirations and Academic Achievement in Science and Mathematics;The purpose of this study was to determine if an integrated mathematics and science instructional approach in which students apply their knowledge to solve engineering problems, is effective in increasing students’ science and mathematics, knowledge, skills and their desire or willingness to take rigorous courses. During the 2009-2010 school year this research studied an integrated science and mathematics curriculum within pre-engineering engineering instruction in 7 th and 8 th grade to determine its effectiveness in helping students use the elements of reasoning to solve the problems in their everyday lives related to science, mathematics, and engineering. Attitudinal surveys were given to determine how the interest levels in Science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) careers and attitudes towards science, mathematics and engineering changed from the beginning of the year as compared to the end of the year. In addition, pre and post tests district content assessments were given to measure changes in students’ understanding of mathematics and science concepts. Lastly, several treatment students were interviewed for qualitative data concerning similar areas from the surveys. The results from this research study propose several recommendations for schools implementing a STEM course or programming. These outline areas of need in the areas of student attitudes and beliefs and the desire of students to enroll in rigorous coursework.;873247689;Dissertations & Theses;;Kutch, Michelle;;;" Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.";; Dissertation/Thesis;; 2011; 978-1-124-66773-7;;; English; English;;;2011;ProQuest Dissertations and Theses;2011;;https://search.proquest.com/docview/873247689?accountid=11774; 0450 Middle School education , 0714 Science education , 0727 Curriculum development; 0450 Middle School education , 0714 Science education , 0727 Curriculum development;; 0450 Middle School education , 0714 Science education , 0727 Curriculum development;;; 0450 Middle School education , 0714 Science education , 0727 Curriculum development; Middle School education , Science education , Curriculum development , Mathematics education , Career advancement , Academic achievement , Attitudes; Education , Academic achievement , Career aspirations , Engineering , Mathematics , Science , Technology;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:Education+Database&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Integrating+Science+and+Mathematics+Instruction+in+a+Middle+School+STEM+Course%3A+The+Impact+on+Attitudes%2C+Career+Aspirations+and+Academic+Achievement+in+Science+and+Mathematics&amp;issn=&amp;date=2011-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Kutch%2C+Michelle&amp;isbn=978-1-124-66773-7&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/";ProQuest Central,Social Science Premium Collection
Making YouTube and Facebook videos: Gender differences in online video creation among first-year undergraduate students attending a highly selective research university;"Online video creation for YouTube and Facebook is a newly popular activity for college students. Creating online videos has been made easier by development of small cameras, video compression, high-speed Internet and online storage. Women have explored social networking technologies at about the same level as men, but have expressed less interest in computer programming and multimedia design. Online video creation includes aspects of both social networking and programming / multimedia design; it provides an interesting hybrid forum for examining gender-related differences. This mixed methods study uses questionnaire data from 31% of the population of first-year students attending a highly selective research university. The study explores how online video creation varies by gender after incorporating theoretical concepts of confidence, self-efficacy, attitudes toward computers, perceived ease of use, perceived usefulness, social influence and demographic variables such as socioeconomic status, ethnicity, immigrant status and high school size. The theories of self-efficacy (Bandura), stereotype threat (Steele) and learned helplessness (Abramson) and the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) inform the conceptual framework. The study examines whether gender affects the relationship between computer confidence and online video creation. The study uses descriptive (e.g., analysis of variance) and multivariate (e.g., regression) analyses as well as qualitative inquiry using focus groups and interviews. The study finds significant gender differences in creation of online videos and roles played with video editing. Men report more participation in video creation and editing. Men report more participation in creating videos for required school projects, a finding of concern for policymakers and practitioners. Attitudes toward computers and TAM explain observed gender differences. The Mac computer platform is associated with greater likelihood of video creation. Qualitative inquiry suggests that humorous videos are primarily viewed as created by men and women are less willing to spend available leisure time on video creation. Study results inform academic support interventions to promote media literacy, computer confidence and consistent perceptions of ease of use of video technologies for all students.";868146346;Dissertations & Theses;;Vedantham, Anuradha;;" YouTube Inc , Facebook Inc

Undergraduate physics course innovations and their impact on student learning;Over the last several decades, the efficacy of the traditional lecture-based instructional model for undergraduate physics courses has been challenged. As a result, a large number of reform-oriented instructional innovations have been developed, enacted, and studied in undergraduate physics courses around the globe—all with the intended purpose of improving student learning. This thesis satisfies the need for a comprehensive synthesis of the effectiveness of these course innovations by analyzing: (1) the types of innovations that have been enacted, (2) the impact of these innovations on student learning, and (3) the common features of effective innovations. An exhaustive literature search for studies published after 1990 on undergraduate physics course innovations yielded 432 articles which were then coded with respect to the characteristics of the innovations used as well as the methodological characteristics of the studies. These codes facilitated a descriptive analysis which characterized the features of the pool of studies. These studies were then meta-analyzed in order to evaluate the effect of innovations on student learning. Finally, a case-study analysis was conducted in order to identify the critical characteristics of effective innovations. Results indicate that most innovations focus on introductory mechanics and use some combination of conceptually oriented tasks, collaborative learning, and technology. The overall effect of course innovations has been positive, but with the caveat that a large number of studies suffer from poor methodological designs and potential threats to validity. In addition, over half of the studies had to be eliminated from the meta-analysis because they did not report the data necessary for an effect size to be calculated. Despite these limitations the results of the meta-analysis indicated that there was one innovation which had particularly high effect sizes—Workshop/Studio Physics—an innovation which involves an integrated classroom environment in which there is minimal or no lectures and class time focuses on collaborative student activities involving the use of technology.;867673319;Dissertations & Theses;;Iverson, Heidi Louise;;;" Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.";; Dissertation/Thesis;; 2011; 978-1-124-62085-5;;; English; English;;;2011;ProQuest Dissertations and Theses;2011;;https://search.proquest.com/docview/867673319?accountid=11774; 0714 Science education , 0745 Higher education; 0714 Science education , 0745 Higher education;; 0714 Science education , 0745 Higher education;;; 0714 Science education , 0745 Higher education; Science education , Higher education , College students , Physics , Student attitudes , Learning , Public speaking; Education , Innovation , Meta-analysis , Physics , Undergraduate education;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:Education+Database&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Undergraduate+physics+course+innovations+and+their+impact+on+student+learning&amp;issn=&amp;date=2011-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Iverson%2C+Heidi+Louise&amp;isbn=978-1-124-62085-5&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/";ProQuest Central,Social Science Premium Collection
The Relationship Between the Proportion of Same-major Friendships and Academic and Affective Outcomes for Women and Men in STEM;The importance of gender equity in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) has continued to be an area of national concern. Research examining women's experiences in STEM has highlighted several factors, both at the student- and institutional-level, that contribute to women's continued underrepresentation in STEM, especially in fields such as engineering and computer science (NSF, 2009). However, few of these studies take into account the effect of peer relationships on students' experiences in STEM. As friendships have been shown to have particular significance in the lives of women, it seems clear that research on women's underrepresentation in STEM would benefit from an examination of the relationships between friendships and academic and social outcomes. Data for this study are drawn from UCLA's Cooperative Institutional Research Program's 1996 Freshman Survey and the 2000 College Student Survey (CSS). The 2000 CSS includes a key variable which asks students about the proportion of close friends they have of a particular social or demographic group, including one's major. The study sample includes data for 1,478 women and 1,406 men, all of whom completed both surveys and indicated on the 2000 CSS that they will graduate with a bachelor's degree in a STEM field. Findings from this investigation confirm that same-major friends can positively impact STEM students' academic and social outcomes. Regression results indicate that, for men, having higher proportions of same-major friends corresponds to an increased likelihood of aspiring to have a STEM career and higher levels of science identity goals and scientific orientation. However for women, having more same-major friends was significantly related only to an increase in scientific orientation. While it was unexpected that same-major friendships would have a significant relationship with more outcomes for men than women, this work does indicate a small but positive impact of same-major friends for STEM students. However, same-major friends did not impact academic self-confidence and psychological well-being for this study sample. Based on these findings, recommendations for faculty, student affairs practitioners and administrators on encouraging friendship formation among STEM students are posed, as well as suggestions for future research to expand on our knowledge of peel relationships and STEM student experiences in college.;863639205;Dissertations & Theses;;Shapiro, Casey Ann Eznekier;;;" Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.";; Dissertation/Thesis;; 2011; 978-1-124-57814-9;;; English; English;;;2011;ProQuest Dissertations and Theses;2011;;https://search.proquest.com/docview/863639205?accountid=11774; 0340 Educational sociology , 0745 Higher education; 0340 Educational sociology , 0745 Higher education;; 0340 Educational sociology , 0745 Higher education;;; 0340 Educational sociology , 0745 Higher education; Educational sociology , Higher education , Friendship , Women , Mathematics education , Men , Engineering , Science education , Educational technology; Education , Academic outcome , Affective outcome , College friendships , Friendship , Higher education , Science, technology, engineering, and mathematics , Women students;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:Education+Database&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+Relationship+Between+the+Proportion+of+Same-major+Friendships+and+Academic+and+Affective+Outcomes+for+Women+and+Men+in+STEM&amp;issn=&amp;date=2011-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Shapiro%2C+Casey+Ann+Eznekier&amp;isbn=978-1-124-57814-9&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/";ProQuest Central,Social Science Premium Collection
I am here—are you there? Sense of presence and implications for virtual world design;"We use the language of presence and place when we interact online: in our instant text messaging windows we often post: “Are you there?” Research indicates the importance of the sense of presence for computer-supported collaborative virtual learning. To realize the potential of virtual worlds such as Second Life, which may have advantages over conventional text-based environments, we need an understanding of design and the emergence of the sense of presence. A construct was created for the sense of presence, as a collaborative, action-based process (Spagnolli, Varotto, &amp; Mantovani, 2003) with four dimensions (sense of place, social presence, individual agency, and mediated collaborative actions). Nine design principles were mapped against the four dimensions. The guiding question for the study's exploration of the sense of presence was: In the virtual world Second Life, what is the effect on the sense of presence in collaborative learning spaces designed according to the sense of presence construct proposed, using two of the nine design principles, wayfinding and annotation? Another question of interest was: What are the relationships, if any, among the four dimensions of presence? The research utilized both quantitative and qualitative measures. Twenty learners recruited from the Graduate School of Education and Psychology at Pepperdine University carried out three assigned collaborative activities in Second Life under design conditions foregrounding each of the two design conditions, and a combination of the two. Analyses from surveys, Second Life interactions, interviews and a focus group were conducted to investigate how various designed learning environments based in the virtual world contributed to the sense of presence, and to learners' ability to carry out collaborative learning. The major research findings were: (a) the construct appears robust, and future research in its application to other virtual worlds may be fruitful; (b) the experience of wayfinding (finding a path through a virtual space) resulted overall in an observed pattern of a slightly stronger sense of place; (c) the experience of annotation (building) resulted overall in an observed pattern of a slightly stronger sense of agency; and (d) there is a positive association between sense of place and sense of agency.";861627076;Dissertations & Theses;;Suter, Vicki;;;" Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.";; Dissertation/Thesis;; 2011; 978-1-124-55681-9;;; English; English;;;2011;ProQuest Dissertations and Theses;2011;;https://search.proquest.com/docview/861627076?accountid=11774; 0558 Multimedia Communications , 0646 Web Studies , 0710 Educational technology; 0558 Multimedia Communications , 0646 Web Studies , 0710 Educational technology;; 0558 Multimedia Communications , 0646 Web Studies , 0710 Educational technology;;; 0558 Multimedia Communications , 0646 Web Studies , 0710 Educational technology; Multimedia Communications , Web Studies , Educational technology; Communication and the arts , Education , Activity theory , Collaborative learning , Second Life , Sense of presence , Virtual worlds , Wayfinding;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:Publicly+Available+Content+Database&amp;atitle=&amp;title=I+am+here%E2%80%94are+you+there%3F+Sense+of+presence+and+implications+for+virtual+world+design&amp;issn=&amp;date=2011-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Suter%2C+Vicki&amp;isbn=978-1-124-55681-9&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/";ProQuest Central
Emerging Methodologies in Engineering Education Research;  Methodology refers to the theoretical arguments that researchers use in order to justify their research methods and design. There is an extensive range of well established methodologies in the educational research literature of which a growing subset is beginning to be used in engineering education research. A more explicit engagement with methodologies, particularly those that are only emerging in engineering education research, is important so that engineering education researchers can broaden the set of research questions they are able to address. Seven methodologies are outlined and for each an exemplar paper is analyzed in order to demonstrate the methodology in operation and to highlight its particular contribution. The methodologies are: Case Study, Grounded Theory, Ethnography, Action Research, Phenomenography, Discourse Analysis, and Narrative Analysis. It is noted that many of the exemplar papers use some of these methodologies in combination. The exemplar papers show that collectively these methodologies might allow the research community to be able to better address questions around key engineering education challenges, such as students' responses to innovative pedagogies, diversity issues in engineering, and the changing requirements for engineering graduates in the twenty-first century.;857255419;Scholarly Journals;;"Case, Jennifer M;Light, Gregory"; JEEDEQ;; Copyright AMERICAN SOCIETY FOR ENGINEERING EDUCATION Jan 2011;; Feature;; Jan 2011;;1069-4730;1; English; English; 186-210; Washington;Jan 2011;Journal of Engineering Education;2011;100;https://search.proquest.com/docview/857255419?accountid=11774;;; References;;; 186;; Studies , Research & development--R&D , Methods , Design , Theory , Education , Data collection;;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aeducation&amp;atitle=Emerging+Methodologies+in+Engineering+Education+Research&amp;title=Journal+of+Engineering+Education&amp;issn=10694730&amp;date=2011-01-01&amp;volume=100&amp;issue=1&amp;spage=186&amp;au=Case%2C+Jennifer+M%3BLight%2C+Gregory&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=Journal+of+Engineering+Education&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/";ProQuest Central,SciTech Premium Collection,Social Science Premium Collection
Teacher Perceptions and Curricular Analysis of Elementary Library Media Technology Use;One growing trend in school districts is to replace more traditional library instruction classes with technologically integrated instructional design methods. However, little is known about the curricular impact of the shift from traditional library classes to technology/media classes, including teachers' reactions to that shift. This case study both compared the traditional and media-based library classes in one Northeastern U.S. district and examined underlying teacher perceptions of this reform. Conceptual frameworks included Bloom's taxonomy and Vygotsky's social cultural theory. Participants were 164 district teachers. Data sources included a survey of all participating teachers, follow-on interviews with 9 teachers, and the content of the two curricula used. Analysis included descriptive analysis of the survey and identification of both interview patterns and themes and Bloom's knowledge level taught in each curriculum. Data indicated that some teachers had concerns about the use of technology and media resources in place of library resources. Teachers reported in part that their concern related to a limited number of literary offerings available within technology and media programs in comparison to traditional library programs. In addition, both teacher interviews and the review of curriculum indicated students did not have access to resources that supported expanding their literacy and higher order thinking skills. Both of these concerns were supported by the comparative curricular analysis. This study contributes to positive social change by allowing administrators to plan for student success through appropriate incorporation or supplementation of technology into library sciences environments.;850517594;Dissertations & Theses;;Schock, Trisha Kay;;;" Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.";; Dissertation/Thesis;; 2011; 978-1-124-43879-5;;; English; English;;;2011;ProQuest Dissertations and Theses;2011;;https://search.proquest.com/docview/850517594?accountid=11774; 0399 Library science , 0518 Early childhood education , 0524 Elementary education; 0399 Library science , 0518 Early childhood education , 0524 Elementary education;; 0399 Library science , 0518 Early childhood education , 0524 Elementary education;;; 0399 Library science , 0518 Early childhood education , 0524 Elementary education; Library science , Early childhood education , Elementary education; Communication and the arts , Education , Early childhood , Library , Library instruction , Media-based library classes , Technology;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:Library+Science+Database&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Teacher+Perceptions+and+Curricular+Analysis+of+Elementary+Library+Media+Technology+Use&amp;issn=&amp;date=2011-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Schock%2C+Trisha+Kay&amp;isbn=978-1-124-43879-5&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/";ProQuest Central,Social Science Premium Collection

Mapping the Information Systems Curricula in UK Universities;Information Systems (IS) undergraduate student numbers in the UK have reduced by half in the last five years. An increasing number of researchers have been pondering the possible relationship between the modernity of IS curricula and its attractiveness to potential students. To support the debate about IS curricula in the UK and elsewhere, this study provides a comprehensive review of the provision of IS courses across the UK which has not been carried out before on such a large scale. The review focuses on classifying IS courses using two separate classification methods, one of which draws on the UK Quality Assurance Agency's (QAA) Subject Benchmark Statement for Computing (SBSC), and a second that is based on the well established IS 2002 model curriculum. Results are compiled by attributing subjects to categories that have been extended to ensure the accurate reflection of the content of courses, taking into account the variations that exist in terms of module sizes, naming conventions and core/option module relationships. Overall, programming, project management and database design are shown to be the most popular IS subjects offered in the UK. The analysis of the results incorporates limitations that affect the interpretation of the data by highlighting the inherent complexities that exist in trying to measure wide-ranging curricula that borrow subjects from different fields. The findings presented should support IS academics, researchers and course designers in their quest to improve curricula and the IS discipline whose future prospects are tied to the recruitment of adequate numbers of students.

The design, structure, benefits, and challenges of undergraduate research programs at baccalaureate institutions;"Undergraduate research programs have become increasingly important to the teaching and learning agenda of American institutions of higher education. A vast body of literature supports the need for hands-on teaching strategies in and outside of the classroom. In many ways, undergraduate research programs are a response to that need. Furthermore, many institutions of higher education encourage and foster the engagement of undergraduate research initiatives for a plethora of purposes; however, efforts have been met with varied effectiveness. The researcher conducted this study, at two private Liberal Arts colleges and nine research programs, to investigate current undergraduate research practices at the program level. Through 40 individual interviews and document analysis procedures, the researcher determined the design and structure of each research program at institutions that were nominated by national leaders in undergraduate research. The researcher also identified the benefits and challenges associated with conducting ongoing undergraduate research programs as perceived by participating students, faculty mentors, and administrators. The researcher further explored institutional resources that are necessary to support and sustain ongoing research endeavors. Student and faculty roles in undergraduate research as well as student assessment procedures were also examined. This research revealed significant weaknesses in the areas of formulating intended student learning outcomes, ongoing assessment of student learning, faculty rewards and incentives, and overall program structure. Multiple forms of data indicated that formulated student learning outcomes were not used as a foundation for the learning process. Data also revealed that limited assessment tools were used throughout the research experience and that those assessments were not directly used to improve student learning. Also, most faculty reported intrinsic benefits for conducting undergraduate research, but were not monetarily rewarded by their institution.";859449746;Dissertations & Theses;;Herold, Joyce P.;;;" Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.";; Dissertation/Thesis;; 2010; 978-1-124-54666-7;;; English; English;;;2010;ProQuest Dissertations and Theses;2010;;https://search.proquest.com/docview/859449746?accountid=11774; 0446 Higher Education Administration , 0516 Adult education , 0745 Higher education; 0446 Higher Education Administration , 0516 Adult education , 0745 Higher education;; 0446 Higher Education Administration , 0516 Adult education , 0745 Higher education;;; 0446 Higher Education Administration , 0516 Adult education , 0745 Higher education; Higher Education Administration , Adult education , Higher education , Research , Colleges & universities; Education , Active learning , Applied research , Faculty mentor , Faculty-student research , Liberal arts colleges , Undergraduate research;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:Education+Database&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+design%2C+structure%2C+benefits%2C+and+challenges+of+undergraduate+research+programs+at+baccalaureate+institutions&amp;issn=&amp;date=2010-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Herold%2C+Joyce+P.&amp;isbn=978-1-124-54666-7&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/";ProQuest Central,Social Science Premium Collection
Social differentiation, participation inequality and optimal collaborative learning online;This dissertation examines social self-structuring processes and group collaboration online with a special focus on their learning effects. Review of empirical and theoretical literature suggests that functional differentiation and participation inequalities are a constant phenomenon in small and large groups, both online and off. This dissertation examines what effects these inequalities may have on group performance, especially with respect to learning. An optimal unevenness range is proposed in the construct model wherein a curvilinear relationship exists between participation evenness and learning outcomes. A key element of Shannon's mathematical theory of communication, the entropy function, is proposed as a measure of interaction in a wiki online collaborative environment. The author's hypothesis of a curvilinear relationship between relative group participation and learning gain is informed by a broad range of literature from small group communication, system-level analyses, recent examinations of mass collaboration and open source software development, collaborative learning theory, developmental psychology, visual feedback technology, and information theory. A quasi-experimental design was proposed as the best way to test the hypothesis and answer relevant research questions. The procedure included 170 participants on teams of 4-11 co-constructing Purdue-related topics within three broad groupings, 1) a regular wiki, 2) the entropy-enabled Visible Effort Wiki, and 3) offline. Variant entropy levels and control variables were correlated with learning gain, as measured by pretests and posttests. Perceived measures were added as well. Research results and data analysis showed the overall model to be statistically significant at the group level. All predictor variables, including entropy, technical competence, and effort level, and excepting knowledge of Purdue University, were significant.

Impact of teaching in communication sciences and disorders;"Living in today's world requires that one be up to date on the technological advances that have made knowledge more accessible; and being up to date on knowledge is crucial. However, what are the optimal methods for conveying knowledge, and is there one method that will work best for each individual? This study centers on comparing two teaching methods in the context of a short term educational module: a passive lecture method in which the instructor lectures and the students listen and take notes, and an active lecture method in which the instructor includes “hands-on” experiences, discussions and interactive presentations using modern media designed to encourage the students and instructor to interact directly. The study was conducted among Kuwaiti students enrolled in communication sciences to see if there is a significant difference in how they learn in the two different methods. Close attention was also paid to the participants' personality types to see if that would be a factor in how they learn. Both groups performed significantly higher on content tests following instruction. No significant results were observed between the two groups. Ties between personality types and learning methods, while not significant, were noticed. The study shows that success of learning is not just dependent on the learning method. The interaction between personality type and teaching methods still require further investigation, and it is the hope of the facilitator of this study that it serves to aid further studies into how best to teach individuals.";857922008;Dissertations & Theses;;Albustan, Sana Ahmad;;;" Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.";; Dissertation/Thesis;; 2010; 978-1-124-51820-6;;; English; English;;;2010;ProQuest Dissertations and Theses;2010;;https://search.proquest.com/docview/857922008?accountid=11774; 0460 Speech therapy , 0745 Higher education; 0460 Speech therapy , 0745 Higher education;; 0460 Speech therapy , 0745 Higher education;;; 0460 Speech therapy , 0745 Higher education; Speech therapy , Higher education; Health and environmental sciences , Education , Communication sciences and disorders , Disorders , Education model , Female college students , Keirsey Four Type Sorter , Kuwait , Stuttering;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:Nursing+%26+Allied+Health+Database&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Impact+of+teaching+in+communication+sciences+and+disorders&amp;issn=&amp;date=2010-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Albustan%2C+Sana+Ahmad&amp;isbn=978-1-124-51820-6&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/";ProQuest Central
Understanding the social and cognitive experiences of children involved in technology design processes;Technology has become ubiquitous not only in the lives of adults, but also in the lives of children. For every technology, there is a process by which it is designed. In many cases, children are involved in these design processes. This study examined the social and cognitive experiences of children who were integrally involved in a technology design process in partnership with adults. This research study employed a Vygotskian lens with a case study research method, to understand the cognitive and social experiences of child technology design partners over a one-year period of design and partnership. Artifact analysis, participant observation, and interviews were used to collect and analyze data. Results from this study demonstrated that children involved in technology design process in partnership with adults experienced social and cognitive experiences which fall into the areas of relationships, enjoyment, confidence, communication, collaboration, skills, and content.;855814381;Dissertations & Theses;;Guha, Mona Leigh;;;" Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.";; Dissertation/Thesis;; 2010; 978-1-124-48665-9;;; English; English;;;2010;ProQuest Dissertations and Theses;2010;;https://search.proquest.com/docview/855814381?accountid=11774; 0489 Information Technology , 0710 Educational technology , 0984 Computer science; 0489 Information Technology , 0710 Educational technology , 0984 Computer science;; 0489 Information Technology , 0710 Educational technology , 0984 Computer science;;; 0489 Information Technology , 0710 Educational technology , 0984 Computer science; Information Technology , Educational technology , Computer science; Education , Applied sciences , Children , Cognitive , Design , Qualitative , Social , Social experiences , Technology , Technology design;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:Publicly+Available+Content+Database&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Understanding+the+social+and+cognitive+experiences+of+children+involved+in+technology+design+processes&amp;issn=&amp;date=2010-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Guha%2C+Mona+Leigh&amp;isbn=978-1-124-48665-9&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/";ProQuest Central
Assessment of online learners' performance using Effective Note-taking in Chat in Online Learning (ENCO);The purpose of this study is to examine the effect of providing note-taking functionality to online chat logs on students enrolled in graduate online learning courses. This study provided participants in online learning courses with a new tool called Effective Note-taking in Chat in Online Learning (ENCO) that enables the participants to select any message lines in chat logs individually, save the lines, and retrieve the lines. This study examined users’ test scores and time taken to complete the tests provided in order to explore user learning performance and effectiveness. The experiment was conducted across two consecutive semesters using volunteers enrolled in six online courses of master’s program in library and information science. After a pilot test with a focus group interview, a main experiment was conducted successfully in the following semester. The results of the main experiments were analyzed to examine whether ENCO improved learners’ performance, effectiveness, and satisfaction using chat logs in online classes. Data from a total of forty-seven online graduate students were analyzed in the main study. The data included test scores and time spent to complete the tests. The results from this study indicate that ENCO use in one course was found to have significantly improved the test scores, and to have decreased test completion time in the other course. The results from focus group interviews showed that majority of the participants in the focus group evaluated ENCO as a helpful tool. Also, four categories of the test questions were analyzed by Bloom’s Taxonomy. The results of the questions analysis imply that ENCO use in the categorized question analysis could be viewed from different perspective. Overall, ENCO was found to have potential for improving students learning performance, effectiveness, and satisfaction in online learning. The results of performance testing suggest that adapting a new tool or software to online learning systems may improve online learners’ performance. More in-depth research about synchronous communication tools that include textual chat and audio/video enabled chat is recommended.;849723086;Dissertations & Theses;;Kim, Joonmin;;;" Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.";; Dissertation/Thesis;; 2010; 978-1-124-45730-7;;; English; English;;;2010;ProQuest Dissertations and Theses;2010;;https://search.proquest.com/docview/849723086?accountid=11774; 0447 Instructional Design , 0646 Web Studies , 0710 Educational technology , 0723 Information science; 0447 Instructional Design , 0646 Web Studies , 0710 Educational technology , 0723 Information science;; 0447 Instructional Design , 0646 Web Studies , 0710 Educational technology , 0723 Information science;;; 0447 Instructional Design , 0646 Web Studies , 0710 Educational technology , 0723 Information science; Instructional Design , Web Studies , Educational technology , Information science , Online instruction , Educational evaluation; Communication and the arts , Education , Chat logs , Effective Note-taking in Chat in Online Learning , Note-taking , Online , Synchronous communication;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:Education+Database&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Assessment+of+online+learners%27+performance+using+Effective+Note-taking+in+Chat+in+Online+Learning+%28ENCO%29&amp;issn=&amp;date=2010-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Kim%2C+Joonmin&amp;isbn=978-1-124-45730-7&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/";ProQuest Central,Social Science Premium Collection
Curricular Decision-Making in Community College Mathematics Courses for Elementary Teachers;"Although the mathematical preparation of future teachers is of particular concern within the field of mathematics education right now, little research has taken into account the increasing role of community colleges in offering mathematics courses for elementary teachers. The purpose of this study was to investigate the curricular decisions of community college instructors who teach these courses as an initial step towards understanding the types of mathematical opportunities that might be available to students in these settings. The study addresses the following research questions: How is written curriculum adopted for community college mathematics courses for elementary teachers? What factors influence instructors' decisions in implementing mathematics curriculum for elementary teachers in these courses? Interview data was collected from 21 department chairs and instructors of mathematics courses for elementary teachers at four community colleges in the United States. Analysis of the data revealed four themes that described variations in influences on curricular decision-making between colleges: department autonomy in course design, course consistency and sharing of resources, use of the textbook and other curricular resources, and instructional practices. From those themes, models of curricular decision-making for each college were developed, demonstrating that curricular decisions were made at different levels depending on the structure and organization of the department around this course. Drawing upon these models, as well as Lattuca &amp; Stark's Academic Plan (2009), an expansion of Remillard's (1999) framework of arenas of curricular decision-making is presented which incorporates curricular decisions that are made outside the level of the individual instructor. Three external influences particular to community college mathematics courses for elementary teachers—transfer, the textbook, and organization of the department around the course—are identified and described, and implications for both research and practice are presented.";849540672;Dissertations & Theses;;Jeppsen, Amy;;;" Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.";; Dissertation/Thesis;; 2010; 978-1-124-43972-3;;; English; English;;;2010;ProQuest Dissertations and Theses;2010;;https://search.proquest.com/docview/849540672?accountid=11774; 0275 Community college education , 0280 Mathematics education , 0530 Teacher education; 0275 Community college education , 0280 Mathematics education , 0530 Teacher education;; 0275 Community college education , 0280 Mathematics education , 0530 Teacher education;;; 0275 Community college education , 0280 Mathematics education , 0530 Teacher education; Community college education , Mathematics education , Teacher education , Curriculum development , Decision making; Education , Community college , Curriculum , Mathematics for elementary teachers , Teacher education;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:Education+Database&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Curricular+Decision-Making+in+Community+College+Mathematics+Courses+for+Elementary+Teachers&amp;issn=&amp;date=2010-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Jeppsen%2C+Amy&amp;isbn=978-1-124-43972-3&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/";ProQuest Central,Social Science Premium Collection
Evolving Information Technology: A Case Study of the Effects of Constant Change on Information Technology Instructional Design Architecture;"A major challenge for Information Technology (IT) programs is that the rapid pace of evolution of computing technology leads to frequent redesign of IT courses. The problem is exacerbated by several factors. Firstly, the changing technology is the subject matter of the discipline and is also frequently used to support instruction; secondly, this discipline has only been formalized as a four-year university program within recent years and there is a lack of established textbooks and curriculum models; finally, updating courses is seldom rewarded in a higher education system that favors research and teaching for promotion and tenure. Thus, continuously updating their courses place a significant burden on the faculty. A case study approach was used to describe and explain the change processes in updating IT courses. Several faculty members at two institutions were interviewed and course changes were identified and analyzed. The analysis revealed a set of recurrent themes in change processes. An instructional design architecture approach also revealed a set of design domains representing the structure of the change processes. The design domains were analyzed in terms of the design decisions they represented, and also in terms of structures, functions and activities, which are related to Structures-Behaviors-Functions (SBF) analysis. The design domains model helped to explain both negative and positive outcomes that were observed in the data. When design efforts impact multiple domains the design is likely to be more difficult. Understanding the design domain architecture will assist future designers in this discipline.";848920178;Dissertations & Theses;;Helps, Richard;;;" Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.";; Dissertation/Thesis;; 2010; 978-1-124-43256-4;;; English; English;;;2010;ProQuest Dissertations and Theses;2010;;https://search.proquest.com/docview/848920178?accountid=11774; 0447 Instructional Design , 0489 Information Technology , 0745 Higher education; 0447 Instructional Design , 0489 Information Technology , 0745 Higher education;; 0447 Instructional Design , 0489 Information Technology , 0745 Higher education;;; 0447 Instructional Design , 0489 Information Technology , 0745 Higher education; Instructional Design , Information technology , Higher education , Technological change; Education , Applied sciences , Changing curricula , Design layers , Instructional Design Theory , Instructional design architecture , Structures-Behaviors-Functions;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:Education+Database&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Evolving+Information+Technology%3A+A+Case+Study+of+the+Effects+of+Constant+Change+on+Information+Technology+Instructional+Design+Architecture&amp;issn=&amp;date=2010-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Helps%2C+Richard&amp;isbn=978-1-124-43256-4&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/";ProQuest Central,Social Science Premium Collection
Policy implementation and technological literacy: A case study;The fundamental problem addressed by this policy implementation case study is the lack of information about street-level efforts to incorporate Technological Literacy into Pennsylvania’s middle and high schools. The purpose of this research was to begin filling in this information gap by analyzing how one such policy – Pennsylvania’s Classrooms for the Future (CFF) program – is being implemented in a set of rural school districts. This implementation case study investigated the implementation of CFF using a modified “bottom-up”-style approach. This study examined the local-level policy context as well as the characteristics and activities of teachers and administrators tasked with implementing CFF. This study contributes to the policy implementation literature by using a combination of existing methodologies to expand the field into an important policy domain. The information obtained from this study was expected to provide insight into: (1) how the CFF policy is implemented in context, and (2) how the attitudes, behavior, and perceptions of street-level implementers affect the implementation of CFF. The study findings suggest that CFF is considered to be an important part of school/district Technological Literacy efforts by both teachers and administrators. However, the two groups exhibit some dissonance in their cognitive understandings of the bases of CFF, their perceptions of the implementation behaviors related to CFF, and the perceived success and impact of CFF. The CFF program is seen by both groups as having its primary impact on classroom intangibles (e.g. motivation, and engagement) rather than quantitative academic performance outcomes. Valuation of the policy was seen to differ based on length of exposure to the CFF program as well as the relative “strength” of the district. The dissonance between administrators and teachers suggest that the level of implementer discretion is likely. This discretion is likely exacerbated by inadequate training and competition from other priorities.;817926322;Dissertations & Theses;;Stone, Jeffrey A.;;;" Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.";; Dissertation/Thesis;; 2010; 978-1-124-36172-7;;; English; English;;;2010;ProQuest Dissertations and Theses;2010;;https://search.proquest.com/docview/817926322?accountid=11774; 0458 Education Policy , 0617 Public administration , 0630 Public policy; 0458 Education Policy , 0617 Public administration , 0630 Public policy;; 0458 Education Policy , 0617 Public administration , 0630 Public policy;;; 0458 Education Policy , 0617 Public administration , 0630 Public policy; Education Policy , School administration , Educational technology , Digital literacy; Education , Social sciences , 21st century skills , Education policy , Education reform , Policy implementation , State policy , Technological literacy;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:Education+Database&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Policy+implementation+and+technological+literacy%3A+A+case+study&amp;issn=&amp;date=2010-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Stone%2C+Jeffrey+A.&amp;isbn=978-1-124-36172-7&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/";ProQuest Central,Social Science Premium Collection
Factors influencing success in online high school algebra;At present, an increasing number of students at the K-12 level in the U.S. are taking courses online via virtual schools, which have been in existence since the end of the 20 th century. Virtual schooling is becoming a mainstream option alongside traditional face-to-face learning environments. Even with its increasing popularity, very few empirical studies have been conducted to provide practical guidance for teaching, learning, research, and policy making in K-12 virtual schooling. Some leading virtual school organizations, such as the Southern Regional Educational Board and the International Association for K-12 Online Learning, have produced standards in these fields. However, many of the standards lack empirical support based on research conducted in virtual learning environments. Math has been identified as a very important force to push a society forward since it is considered a foundational subject. Many countries emphasize the improvement of math knowledge and they develop policies to attract more people to the field. The examination of success factors in the math field in general and Algebra in specific in virtual learning environments can provide better implementation strategies in 12 virtual schools to improve student math and science achievement and increase the Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) workforce in U.S. The purpose of this study is to examine the factors including LMS utilization, teacher comment/feedback and student demographic information that can influence the success of Algebra courses in K-12 virtual learning environments. Students who completed Algebra and took the end-of-course (EOC) test and students who took one state standardized mathematics test at grade 6-8 level in a state virtual school in the Midwestern U.S. region during 2008-2009 participated in this study. Student scores on these tests were collected by this virtual school. Hierarchical linear modeling (HLM) technique was used for data analysis to account for the influence of school characteristics on student scores. The results show these factors have different influences on student performance on the state standardized mathematics test and the Algebra EOC test. These findings have implications for quality online teaching, instructional design, and the policy-making process in virtual learning environments. Further research is proposed based on the results and limitations of this study.;817396379;Dissertations & Theses;;Liu, Feng;;;" Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.";; Dissertation/Thesis;; 2010; 978-1-124-36088-1;;; English; English;;;2010;ProQuest Dissertations and Theses;2010;;https://search.proquest.com/docview/817396379?accountid=11774; 0280 Mathematics education , 0447 Instructional Design , 0533 Secondary education; 0280 Mathematics education , 0447 Instructional Design , 0533 Secondary education;; 0280 Mathematics education , 0447 Instructional Design , 0533 Secondary education;;; 0280 Mathematics education , 0447 Instructional Design , 0533 Secondary education; Mathematics education , Instructional Design , Secondary education , Online instruction , Algebra; Education , Algebra , Hierarchial linear modeling , Online education , Success factors , Virtual schooling;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:Education+Database&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Factors+influencing+success+in+online+high+school+algebra&amp;issn=&amp;date=2010-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Liu%2C+Feng&amp;isbn=978-1-124-36088-1&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/";ProQuest Central,Social Science Premium Collection
QFD-based curriculum planning for vocational education;"In the past two decades, Hong Kong's economic activities have markedly shifted from manufacturing to services. The economic shift has led to a radical change of manpower demand, which has brought great challenges to industrial training. Besides many new jobs created by the services industries, the upgrade from production to provision of services of the manufacturing industries requires new industrial training programmes. In regard to the needs of the industrial training industry, the aim of the study was to adopt the basic principles of QFD, a proven methodology for achieving customer satisfaction and a useful product development technique, to develop an industrial training curriculum development model for enhancing the industry-specific knowledge required by the job incumbents of the service-oriented manufacturing industries in Hong Kong. Firmly adhering to the QFD principles, the model was characterized by the performance-focused and job-incumbent-centred approach. Recognizing the importance of dually meeting the job performance requirements and the knowledge needs of the incumbents, the model emphasizes that both the employers' and individuals' voices have to be carefully listened to and provides a mechanism for appropriately incorporating the voices into the development process so as to yield a curriculum that would satisfy the respective needs of the two parties. In addition to assisting managers to define the ""Whats"" and job incumbents to identify the important ""Hows"", the industry training practitioners' job is to synthesize the materials into a coherent curriculum for meeting their needs. Through logical task appropriation, the model creates an all-win situation for the parties concerned. Using the clothing industry in Hong Kong as the ground for study, a quasi-experiment and two field applications were conducted to demonstrate the applicability of the model. In addition to the high customer satisfaction levels recorded for the industrial training curriculum developed using the model, a number of positive comments were received from those who had used the model in empirical studies. All of the data obtained from the empirical studies provided practical evidence for illustrating that the model is useful for developing industrial training curricula.";768711085;Dissertations & Theses;;Chan, Yin Ping;;;" Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.";; Dissertation/Thesis;; 2010; 978-1-124-29379-0;;; English; English;;;2010;ProQuest Dissertations and Theses;2010;;https://search.proquest.com/docview/768711085?accountid=11774; 0727 Curriculum development , 0747 Vocational education; 0727 Curriculum development , 0747 Vocational education;; 0727 Curriculum development , 0747 Vocational education;;; 0727 Curriculum development , 0747 Vocational education; Curriculum development , Vocational education , Quality management; Education , Clothing industry , Curriculum planning , Garment merchandising , Quality functional deployment , Vocational education;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:Education+Database&amp;atitle=&amp;title=QFD-based+curriculum+planning+for+vocational+education&amp;issn=&amp;date=2010-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Chan%2C+Yin+Ping&amp;isbn=978-1-124-29379-0&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/";ProQuest Central,Social Science Premium Collection
Ethics and morality in software development: A developer's perspective;"Computers and other digital devices have become ubiquitous in our lives. Almost all aspects of our lives are in part or wholly impacted by computers and the software that runs on them. Unknowingly, we are placing our livelihoods and even our lives in the hands unknown software developers. Ethical and moral decisions made during software development projects may impact how lives are lived and businesses conducted. Traditional studies of ethics in information technology (IT) have primarily centered on the ethical uses of computers and software; issues such as privacy, piracy, copyright protection, hacking, and so forth. These are in reality, “after-the-fact” issues in that the processes or capabilities used in each of these examples were designed into the system before any ethical or moral behavioral issues occurred. Little research has been done on how IT professionals, specifically software developers, make ethical and moral decisions, or if they even believe that they encounter ethical or moral decision making opportunities, during software development projects. Many theories for explaining and predicting ethical and moral behavior have been developed. Traditional theories ranging from deontology to virtue ethics have helped researchers and social scientists categorize human behavior in relation to ethical and moral judgments. Another theory, proposed by Forsyth ( A taxonomy of ethical ideologies, 1980), called ethics position theory (EPT), calls for categorizing human behavior and thinking into four categories labeled situationism, absolutism, subjectivism, and exceptionism. EPT suggests ethical characteristics and tendencies can be determined, based on where a person falls in relation to the four categories identified. This study examined the application of EPT in relation to decisions made by software designers and developers during software development projects. The initial hypotheses proposed were; (1) Software developers and designers do not believe they encounter ethical or moral decision making opportunities during their software development projects; (2) the ethical and moral beliefs of software developers and designers fall primarily into the situationism or subjectivism categories; (3) and that factors such as age, gender, career experience, and culture are mitigating factors in determining where on the EPT scale software developers and designers fall.";763225484;Dissertations & Theses;;Stephenson, James H.;;;" Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.";; Dissertation/Thesis;; 2010; 978-1-124-28784-3;;; English; English;;;2010;ProQuest Dissertations and Theses;2010;;https://search.proquest.com/docview/763225484?accountid=11774; 0394 Ethics , 0489 Information Technology , 0984 Computer science; 0394 Ethics , 0489 Information Technology , 0984 Computer science;; 0394 Ethics , 0489 Information Technology , 0984 Computer science;;; 0394 Ethics , 0489 Information Technology , 0984 Computer science; Ethics , Information Technology , Computer science; Philosophy, religion and theology , Applied sciences , Applications , Ethics , Morality , Software , Software development , Software engineering;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:Publicly+Available+Content+Database&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Ethics+and+morality+in+software+development%3A+A+developer%27s+perspective&amp;issn=&amp;date=2010-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Stephenson%2C+James+H.&amp;isbn=978-1-124-28784-3&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/";ProQuest Central
Informing complex interventions in technology-rich teaching ecologies: A study of structured lecture podcasting to facilitate active learning;Since 2005, there has been rapid adoption of the use of podcasting in schools. In this flood of adoption, content has been recorded and distributed, but predominantly not internally structured or pedagogically integrated. This research aims to remedy pedagogical deficiencies in lecture podcasting by making use of chapter feature technology to support the adoption and integration of active learning. This study was conducted in the context of several pedagogical reform movements in which instructors are being encouraged to make major changes toward active learning practices and technology usage in pedagogy. Best practices for active learning are used as a design guide to integrate the technology intervention and support the interrelated processes within the teaching ecology. Also in the ecological context, as mobile media players are quickly becoming ubiquitous so is persistent media multitasking. However, the processing of multiple information streams is considered a challenge for human cognition. This study further investigates the relationship between the technology intervention and processing multiple information streams through multitasking preferences and features of psychological flow. Students completed standard assessments of comprehension in their regular coursework and then completed a survey instrument at the end of the course. The design, development and application of this instrument are described. Latent variables in the instrument are considered and described and then a construct validity method is used in the analysis and verification of the instrument. Correlation analysis describes the relationships between the factors in relation to intent to use, and also multitasking preferences and flow features. General linear model analysis describes the relationship of active learning behaviors to learning outcomes. Quantitative and qualitative data are gathered and analyzed for student perceptions of the intervention system, active learning activity, student media multitasking preferences and student learning outcomes. Many students experience significantly lower levels of interaction in a traditional large enrollment lecture hall style course, but this study discovered a positive progressive relationship between facilitating active learning behaviors with an elective technology system and a large enrollment class’s learning outcomes. Technology system use was also moderately correlated to media multitasking preferences. Some encouraging indicators suggest that further research is warranted.;761646033;Dissertations & Theses;;Nickles, David James;;;" Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.";; Dissertation/Thesis;; 2010; 978-1-124-29868-9;;; English; English;;;2010;ProQuest Dissertations and Theses;2010;;https://search.proquest.com/docview/761646033?accountid=11774; 0710 Educational technology , 0984 Computer science; 0710 Educational technology , 0984 Computer science;; 0710 Educational technology , 0984 Computer science;;; 0710 Educational technology , 0984 Computer science; Educational technology , Computer science , Active learning , Quality of education , Education reform; Education , Applied sciences , Active learning , Podcasting , Structured lectures;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:Education+Database&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Informing+complex+interventions+in+technology-rich+teaching+ecologies%3A+A+study+of+structured+lecture+podcasting+to+facilitate+active+learning&amp;issn=&amp;date=2010-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Nickles%2C+David+James&amp;isbn=978-1-124-29868-9&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/";ProQuest Central,Social Science Premium Collection
The sharing of academic content through the use of the RoboBooks website;"A disconnect exists between the ideologies for problem solving in the engineering industry, where teams of engineers work together to achieve a goal, and in academics, where students are often assessed on their individual achievements. This research focuses on one means of beginning to address this ideological gap, by looking at student sharing of their academic material. Sharing is defined as the exchange of information between individuals who may benefit from seeing the work being produced by their peers. Sharing is not synonymous with collaboration though, because these students are not working together to create a single output; the individuals create their own end products. This research creates a model of how students share with each other, both in person and online. A RoboBooks website was introduced as an online tool to support student sharing. Based on the usage of this website, the results offer suggestions for the development of functionality to promote sharing of material through a website. Specifically, the results show that simply supplying the students with the RoboBooks website isn’t enough to make them use it for sharing; on average they downloaded less than 1 student RoboBook per week, when at least 1 per week was expected. When given instruction to share, 88% of students express a preference to do so in person but 90% use the website to gather important information quickly. 71% of students polled rank the RoboBooks website above other online sharing technologies. Key functionality for a sharing website includes: real-time communication between members, images and descriptions of content, and the ability to upload and retrieve content.";757364987;Dissertations & Theses;;Sneeringer, Peter A.;;;" Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.";; Dissertation/Thesis;; 2010; 978-1-124-21248-7;;; English; English;;;2010;ProQuest Dissertations and Theses;2010;;https://search.proquest.com/docview/757364987?accountid=11774; 0489 Information Technology , 0548 Mechanical engineering; 0489 Information Technology , 0548 Mechanical engineering;; 0489 Information Technology , 0548 Mechanical engineering;;; 0489 Information Technology , 0548 Mechanical engineering; Information Technology , Mechanical engineering; Applied sciences;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:Publicly+Available+Content+Database&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+sharing+of+academic+content+through+the+use+of+the+RoboBooks+website&amp;issn=&amp;date=2010-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Sneeringer%2C+Peter+A.&amp;isbn=978-1-124-21248-7&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/";ProQuest Central
The influence of alternative pedagogical methods in postsecondary biology education: How do students experience a multimedia case-study environment?;The purpose of this study was to better understand how an online, multimedia case study method influenced students' motivation, performance, and perceptions of science in collegiate level biology classes. It utilized a mix-methods design including data from pre- and post-test, student surveys, and focus group interviews to answer one primary question, did participation in the affect student performance? Two sub-questions were: (a) did participation affect persistence? and (b) did students believe it to be a good learning experience? One hundred and eight students in 5 classes from 4 campuses in the United States and Puerto Rico participated in this study during spring semester 2009. After receiving instruction on HIV, students took a 6 questions pre-test to measure their initial knowledge of both HIV and lab procedures. Participants then engaged in the Case It! learning environment, where they watched case-studies on HIV, used virtual lab tools, created an online poster of their findings, and role-played as both family members and physicians about their case. A post-test identical to the pre-test was given to students upon completion. Both were then scored using rubrics and analyzed via paired t -Tests and ANOVA. The researcher visited all 4 study sites to conduct both the focus group interviews and student surveys. Student surveys were quantified and descriptive statistics generated. Focus group interviews were video recorded, transcribed, and inductively and deductively coded. Student knowledge increased because of participation, and the majority of students said they found the Case It! project to be both a good learning experience (95%) and one that would help with future classes or careers (87%). Based on student interviews, the Case It! project did have a beneficial impact on students' intentions to persist as science majors. Many students noted that the learning environment created an overall context in which they could apply knowledge from multiple classes that allowed students to fit all the pieces of their previous academic instruction together into a single, comprehensive picture—and to place themselves within that picture. Students enjoyed the autonomy and personal connections that using case studies and multimedia content offered, and found the material more engaging and relevant. By involving students in real-world situations, Case It! demonstrated the application and effect of theoretical knowledge and stimulated students' curiosity. Case It! motivates students by making material relevant and personal, thus creating enduring links between students and content which can result in better performance and higher retention rates. It is an effective pedagogical tool that, unlike many other such tools, is not instructor dependent, and is adaptable to fit various learner types, settings, and levels.;746094516;Dissertations & Theses;;Wolter, Bjorn Hugo Karl;;;" Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.";; Dissertation/Thesis;; 2010; 978-1-124-13790-2;;; English; English;;;2010;ProQuest Dissertations and Theses;2010;;https://search.proquest.com/docview/746094516?accountid=11774; 0456 Pedagogy , 0714 Science education , 0745 Higher education; 0456 Pedagogy , 0714 Science education , 0745 Higher education;; 0456 Pedagogy , 0714 Science education , 0745 Higher education;;; 0456 Pedagogy , 0714 Science education , 0745 Higher education; Pedagogy , Science education , Higher education , Teaching methods , Multimedia , Case studies; Education , Case-based instruction , Mixed-methods , Multimedia , Pedagogy , Postsecondary science , STEM education reform;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:Education+Database&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+influence+of+alternative+pedagogical+methods+in+postsecondary+biology+education%3A+How+do+students+experience+a+multimedia+case-study+environment%3F&amp;issn=&amp;date=2010-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Wolter%2C+Bjorn+Hugo+Karl&amp;isbn=978-1-124-13790-2&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/";ProQuest Central,Social Science Premium Collection
Learner response systems: The effects on course level retention and learner success in a community college business microcomputer applications course;A mixed method study was conducted to evaluate the effects of clicker use on retention rates, success rates as measured by final grades, and improvement from pretest to posttest scores in a community college business microcomputer applications course. Learner perceptions towards clicker use were also evaluated. The study group consisted of learners enrolled in COSC125 business microcomputer applications. Learners self-selected into one of four sections, which were then randomly assigned to either the treatment or control group. Each group received identical instruction including the use of questioning techniques and peer instruction activities. The treatment group responded to these questions using clickers and the control group responded by raising their hands or with a verbal response. A total of 79 learners elected to participate in the semester long study, 41 in the treatment group and 38 in the control group. Data was collected using learner retention statistics for those learners who were enrolled on census day and still enrolled after the final drop date. Final grades were used to determine learner success, which was defined as completing the course with a grade of C (70%) or better. Improvements from pretest to posttest scores were also measured. Finally, a learner perception questionnaire was administered to those learners in the treatment group. The learner perception was that the use of clickers helped learners to understand the material, earn better grades, and participate more in the classroom. These perceptions were not supported by statistics which showed no statistical significance between the treatment and control groups in course-level retention, learner success, or improvement in pretest to posttest scores. This study used questioning techniques and peer instruction activities as formative assessment tools supported by the use of clickers in the treatment group. The findings of this study suggest that the pedagogical practices of the facilitator are the key to learner understanding and success, rather than the use of any particular technology.;734421380;Dissertations & Theses;;Acree, Karen L.;;;" Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.";; Dissertation/Thesis;; 2010; 978-1-124-09768-8;;; English; English;;;2010;ProQuest Dissertations and Theses;2010;;https://search.proquest.com/docview/734421380?accountid=11774; 0275 Community college education , 0688 Business education , 0710 Educational technology , 0727 Curriculum development; 0275 Community college education , 0688 Business education , 0710 Educational technology , 0727 Curriculum development;; 0275 Community college education , 0688 Business education , 0710 Educational technology , 0727 Curriculum development;;; 0275 Community college education , 0688 Business education , 0710 Educational technology , 0727 Curriculum development; Community college education , Business education , Educational technology , Curriculum development; Education , Business , Clickers , Course-level retention , Learner response systems , Microcomputer applications , Questioning;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:Education+Database&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Learner+response+systems%3A+The+effects+on+course+level+retention+and+learner+success+in+a+community+college+business+microcomputer+applications+course&amp;issn=&amp;date=2010-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Acree%2C+Karen+L.&amp;isbn=978-1-124-09768-8&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/";ProQuest Central,Social Science Premium Collection
Supporting the “collaborative” part of wiki-mediated collaborative learning activities;Prior research has highlighted the educational benefit of enabling students to participate in collaborative learning activities. Developing technology that extends the physical boundaries of the classroom and enables students to engage in meaningful collaborative learning activities outside class time can be of significant value. For any computer-supported collaborative learning (CSCL) application, there are two issues to address. Did the students learn? Did the technology adequately support the students’ collaboration? The latter question can be referred to as the “collaborative” part of collaborative learning. The collaborative application must create an online intersubjective space that adequately supports the students’ collaborations. Building applications that meet this criterion is not a trivial task. The thesis presents the WikiDesignPlatform (WDP). The case is made that the standard wiki, in conjunction with the platform's extensive set of e.g. awareness, navigational and communicative components comprises a framework that is particularly well suited for custom building collaborative learning applications. The thesis presents evidence showing that because wikis are sufficiently plastic, they afford building applications for a variety of collaborative learning activities that share a common lingua franca of interaction. Students only have to learn one style of interaction and can more readily switch between different collaborative learning activities and applications within a single semester/course. The thesis reports on two case studies that range significantly in how much support was needed for the students' collaborations. The evidence shows that under both conditions, WDP-based learning environments provided a sufficiently rich intersubjective space that adequately supported the students’ online collaborations. The evidence also shows that the WDP can support metacognitive tasks, like reflection or self/co-explanation.;366376150;Dissertations & Theses;;Larusson, Johann Ari;;;" Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.";; Dissertation/Thesis;; 2010; 978-1-109-76805-3;;; English; English;;;2010;ProQuest Dissertations and Theses;2010;;https://search.proquest.com/docview/366376150?accountid=11774; 0447 Instructional Design , 0710 Educational technology , 0984 Computer science; 0447 Instructional Design , 0710 Educational technology , 0984 Computer science;; 0447 Instructional Design , 0710 Educational technology , 0984 Computer science;;; 0447 Instructional Design , 0710 Educational technology , 0984 Computer science; Instructional Design , Educational technology , Computer science , Collaboration , Learning; Education , Applied sciences , Collaborative learning , Computer-supported collaborative work , Coordination , Educational technology , Wikis;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:Education+Database&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Supporting+the+%E2%80%9Ccollaborative%E2%80%9D+part+of+wiki-mediated+collaborative+learning+activities&amp;issn=&amp;date=2010-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Larusson%2C+Johann+Ari&amp;isbn=978-1-109-76805-3&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/";ProQuest Central,Social Science Premium Collection
The role of the Project Management Office on Information Technology project success;"The rate of failed and challenged Information Technology (IT) projects is too high according to the CHAOS Studies by the Standish Group and the literature on project management (Standish Group, 2008). The CHAOS Studies define project success as meeting the triple constraints of scope, time, and cost. Assessing critical success factors is another way of measuring project success (Dai, 2001). A proposed solution for improving the success rate of projects has been implementing a Project Management Office (PMO) which is sometimes referred to as a Program Management Office. The purpose of this study was to gather data to determine if the presence of a PMO improves IT project success based upon the triple constraints and critical success factors. The triple constraints are derived from traditional project success factors; critical success factors are additional variables used to measure project success. The study also considered what impact the type of PMO had on IT project success. Data was collected about IT projects including success criteria and the type of PMO services. Having a formal PMO was not found to have a statistically significant impact on IT project success as compared to the other PMO levels. Having dedicated resources in an organization performing PMO functions was found to have a statistically significant impact on IT project success.";305244394;Dissertations & Theses;;Stewart, Jacob S.;;;" Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.";; Dissertation/Thesis;; 2010; 978-1-109-64309-1;;; English; English;;;2010;ProQuest Dissertations and Theses;2010;;https://search.proquest.com/docview/305244394?accountid=11774; 0454 Management , 0723 Information science , 0984 Computer science; 0454 Management , 0723 Information science , 0984 Computer science;; 0454 Management , 0723 Information science , 0984 Computer science;;; 0454 Management , 0723 Information science , 0984 Computer science; Management , Information science , Computer science , Studies; Communication and the arts , Social sciences , Applied sciences , Best practices , Information technology , PMO , Project Management Office , Project management , Project success;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ABI%2FINFORM+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+role+of+the+Project+Management+Office+on+Information+Technology+project+success&amp;issn=&amp;date=2010-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Stewart%2C+Jacob+S.&amp;isbn=978-1-109-64309-1&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/";ProQuest Central
Action research: Interventions for helping leaders use groups to affect conflict between workforce generations;Ten leaders from specific products and services companies in Detroit, Michigan discovered how the values, ambitions, views, mind-sets, skills, and demographics of the generations in the workplace may be in conflict. Action-learning workshops on the multigenerational characteristics prepared leaders to consider generational characteristics and provide evidence of how generational characteristics helped them form groups. Action-learning workshops delivered information on group models to leaders and helped them understand which group models are most appropriate for the different generational groups in their workplace. Leaders worked together to develop plans for implementing group models to affect conflict between generations in the workforce. Nine of ten participants observed the ability of group models to affect conflict between generations in the workforce and all participants kept a journal to record the experiences. Armed with an understanding of worker satisfaction issues, leaders were able to provide an assessment of worker satisfaction within the leader’s organization. When leaders used group models within their organization, they were able to provide evidence that group models can affect conflict between generations in the workforce and employee satisfaction.;305239619;Dissertations & Theses;;Brooks, Charles E.;;;" Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.";; Dissertation/Thesis;; 2010; 978-1-109-76704-9;;; English; English;;;2010;ProQuest Dissertations and Theses;2010;;https://search.proquest.com/docview/305239619?accountid=11774; 0454 Management; 0454 Management;; 0454 Management;;; 0454 Management; Management; Social sciences , Action learning , Conflict , Generational conflict , Interventions , Value networks , Workforce;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:Publicly+Available+Content+Database&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Action+research%3A+Interventions+for+helping+leaders+use+groups+to+affect+conflict+between+workforce+generations&amp;issn=&amp;date=2010-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Brooks%2C+Charles+E.&amp;isbn=978-1-109-76704-9&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/";ProQuest Central
Integrating cell phones into the secondary Montessori classroom;"A disconnect exists between how students communicate using their mobile phones outside of school and how they use them in the classroom. Many high schools across the United States ban their use, even though numerous mobile learning strategies are available. Although research pertaining to m-learning has been conducted at the collegiate level, a need exists for increased understanding of m-learning at the secondary level. This qualitative case study documented how secondary Montessori classroom teachers' and students' attitudes toward m-learning changed as a result of their experience with using a cell phone in the classroom. The Montessori method and connectivism provided the theoretical foundation. This study identified the limitations and advantages associated with m-learning, the 21st-century skills secondary students demonstrated when using a cell phone, and how students used cell phones to connect to their learning ecology. Data were collected using pre and post interviews of teachers and students, student blog entries, text messages, and 3 observations. Data were analyzed using NVivo 8 to code preliminary categories, and open coding was used to generate themes. The findings revealed the majority of students had a favorable attitude toward m-learning. M-learning strategies supported learning; increased student productivity; reduced classroom disruption; and provided opportunities for “anytime, anyplace” learning. They provided a vehicle to demonstrate 21st-century skills and connect to their learning ecology. This study affects positive social change by enhancing learning through m-learning. The findings of this study can be used to guide educational administrators in making technology policies that best serve the needs of their stakeholders and provide teachers with m-learning strategies that can be integrated successfully into the classroom.";305229558;Dissertations & Theses;;DeWitte, Cynthia M.;;;" Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.";; Dissertation/Thesis;; 2010; 978-1-109-69158-0;;; English; English;;;2010;ProQuest Dissertations and Theses;2010;;https://search.proquest.com/docview/305229558?accountid=11774; 0533 Secondary education , 0643 Technical Communication , 0710 Educational technology; 0533 Secondary education , 0643 Technical Communication , 0710 Educational technology;; 0533 Secondary education , 0643 Technical Communication , 0710 Educational technology;;; 0533 Secondary education , 0643 Technical Communication , 0710 Educational technology; Secondary education , Technical Communication , Educational technology , Cellular telephones; Communication and the arts , Education , Cell phone , M-learning , Mobile learning , Montessori;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:Education+Database&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Integrating+cell+phones+into+the+secondary+Montessori+classroom&amp;issn=&amp;date=2010-01-01&amp;volume=56&amp;issue=2&amp;spage=137&amp;au=Luk%2C+Zoe+Pei%E2%80%90sui%3BShirai%2C+Yasuhiro&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=IRAL%2C+International+Review+of+Applied+Linguistics+in+Language+Teaching&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/10.1515%2Firal-2014-0018";ProQuest Central,Social Science Premium Collection
Discovering and modeling open source software processes;Open source software (OSS) development is quickly gaining acceptance as a software production paradigm with hundreds of thousands of projects and millions of participants. Spanning almost forty years to Royce's waterfall model, software engineering literature has given us best practices for the processes associated with creating software products. Initial indications suggest that OSS projects may not employ software engineering processes as prescribed. Yet, many OSS projects have produced large-scale, widely adopted software systems. While research interest in OSS projects remains avid, few researchers have examined OSS processes. In this dissertation, I present a study to discover and model open source software processes.;305188427;Dissertations & Theses;;Jensen, Christopher Joseph;;;" Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.";; Dissertation/Thesis;; 2010; 978-1-109-53301-9;;; English; English;;;2010;ProQuest Dissertations and Theses;2010;;https://search.proquest.com/docview/305188427?accountid=11774; 0984 Computer science; 0984 Computer science;; 0984 Computer science;;; 0984 Computer science; Computer science; Applied sciences , Open source software , Software engineering , Software process;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:Advanced+Technologies+%26+Aerospace+Dissertations&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Discovering+and+modeling+open+source+software+processes&amp;issn=&amp;date=2010-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Jensen%2C+Christopher+Joseph&amp;isbn=978-1-109-53301-9&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/";SciTech Premium Collection
A framework for integrating Knowledge Management with Risk Management for Information Technology Projects (RiskManiT);This research focused on the challenges experienced when executing risk management activities for information technology projects. The lack of adequate knowledge management support of risk management activities has caused many project failures in the past. The research objective was to propose a conceptual framework of the Knowledge-Based Risk Management (KBRM) process, which integrates KM and RM processes, and presents a methodology for applying the KBRM (RiskManIT) conceptual solution. The research strategy was qualitative and was supported by interviews with subject matter experts to validate the research. The key contribution is the development of a Framework, which integrates the Knowledge Management activities with Risk Management for Information Technology Projects (RiskManIT). The RiskManIT Framework provides the ability to develop remedial project management actions that address the problem of IT project failures by integrating KM and RM in a single framework.;275941047;Dissertations & Theses;;Karadsheh, Louay A.;;;" Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.";; Dissertation/Thesis;; 2010; 978-1-109-72246-8;;; English; English;;;2010;ProQuest Dissertations and Theses;2010;;https://search.proquest.com/docview/275941047?accountid=11774; 0454 Management , 0489 Information Technology; 0454 Management , 0489 Information Technology;; 0454 Management , 0489 Information Technology;;; 0454 Management , 0489 Information Technology; Management , Information Technology , Studies , Knowledge management; Social sciences , Applied sciences , Information technology , Knowledge management , Risk management , Risk management for information technology projects;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ABI%2FINFORM+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=A+framework+for+integrating+Knowledge+Management+with+Risk+Management+for+Information+Technology+Projects+%28RiskManiT%29&amp;issn=&amp;date=2010-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Karadsheh%2C+Louay+A.&amp;isbn=978-1-109-72246-8&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/";ProQuest Central
Laptops and the gender gap: An investigation of a high school core curriculum program;"Girls and women continue to be underrepresented in high school Advanced Placement computer science courses, undergraduate and graduate computer science programs at colleges and universities, and engineering programs and related careers. This is not to suggest that public schools train students to fulfill specific job needs, yet it is evident that the technology gender gap results in unequal educational opportunities in the acquisition of computer skills necessary to pursue higher education in technical fields. This study examines how the use of laptop computers in core curriculum classes at a large suburban high school in southern California has affected female students' learning processes, attitudes, and aspirations; the investigation considers how the characteristics of female as compared with male students relate to their ongoing participation in education and careers and the role of technology therein. The study investigates students' attitudes and experiences in a voluntary specialized program for which laptop computers are provided by the families of students. The study highlights such issues as the level of computer skills among students upon entering the Laptop Program; the Laptop Program's effectiveness in increasing computer literacy, academic achievement, and awareness of careers; the level of administrative commitment to gender equity in the Laptop Program; and the role of teachers in a core curriculum laptop program. Much of the prior research on the gender gap in computing has utilized survey design methodology to present the need for increased outreach to female students and ongoing teacher professional development conducive to full student participation in acquiring pertinent technical and academic skills. The mixed method case study approach utilized in this investigation enhances survey data with class observations, personal interviews, focus group discussions, and student online reflections to provide a deeper and richer insight into students' attitudes and aspirations in the context of a school laptop program.";250920293;Dissertations & Theses;;Wade, Melanie;;;" Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.";; Dissertation/Thesis;; 2010; 978-1-109-67752-2;;; English; English;;;2010;ProQuest Dissertations and Theses;2010;;https://search.proquest.com/docview/250920293?accountid=11774; 0533 Secondary education , 0710 Educational technology , 0727 Curriculum development; 0533 Secondary education , 0710 Educational technology , 0727 Curriculum development;; 0533 Secondary education , 0710 Educational technology , 0727 Curriculum development;;; 0533 Secondary education , 0710 Educational technology , 0727 Curriculum development; Secondary education , Educational technology , Curriculum development , Gender; Education , Core curriculum , Education , Gender gap , High school , Laptop computer , Laptops , One-to-one computing , Technology;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:Education+Database&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Laptops+and+the+gender+gap%3A+An+investigation+of+a+high+school+core+curriculum+program&amp;issn=&amp;date=2010-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Wade%2C+Melanie&amp;isbn=978-1-109-67752-2&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/";ProQuest Central,Social Science Premium Collection
Recommendations of the International Medical Informatics Association (IMIA) on Education in Biomedical and Health Informatics - First Revision;  Objective: The International Medical Infor - matics Association (IMIA) agreed on revising the existing international recommendations in health informatics /medical informatics education. These should help to establish courses, course tracks or even complete programs in this field, to further develop existing educational activities in the various nations and to support international initiatives concerning education in biomedical and health informatics (BMHI), particularly international activities in educating BMHI specialists and the sharing of courseware. Method: An IMIA task force, nominated in 2006, worked on updating the recommendations' first version. These updates have been broadly discussed and refined by members of IMIA's National Member Societies, IMIA's Academic Institutional Members and by members of IMIA's Working Group on Health and Medical Informatics Education. Results and Conclusions: The IMIA recommendations center on educational needs for health care professionals to acquire knowledge and skills in information processing and in - formation and communication technology. The educational needs are described as a threedimensional framework. The dimensions are: 1) professionals in health care (e.g. physicians, nurses, BMHI professionals), 2) type of specialization in BMHI (IT users, BMHI specialists), and 3) stage of career progression (bachelor, Learning outcomes are defined in terms of knowledge and practical skills for health care professionals in their role a) as IT user and b) as BMHI specialist. Recommendations are given for courses /course tracks in BMHI as part of educational programs in medicine, nursing, health care management, dentistry, pharmacy, public health, health record administration, and informatics /computer science as well as for dedicated programs in BMHI (with bachelor, master or doctor degree). To support education in BMHI, IMIA offers to award a certificate for high-quality BMHI education. It supports information exchange on programs and courses in BMHI through its Working Group on Health and Medical Informatics Education.;1170749872;Scholarly Journals;;"Mantas, John;Ammenwerth, Elske;Demiris, George;Hasman, Arie;Haux, Reinhold;Hersh, William;Hovenga, Evelyn;Lun, K C;Marin, Heimar;Martin-Sanchez, Fernando;Wright, Graham";;; Copyright Academy of Medical Sciences of Bosnia and Herzegovina 2010;; Journal Article;; 2010;;0353-8109;1; English; English;; Sarajevo;2010;Acta Informatica Medica;2010;18;https://search.proquest.com/docview/1170749872?accountid=11774;;;;;; 4;;; Medical Informatics , Health Informatics , Biomedical Informatics , Education , Recommendations , International Medical Informatics Association , Imia;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Ahealthcompleteshell&amp;atitle=Recommendations+of+the+International+Medical+Informatics+Association+%28IMIA%29+on+Education+in+Biomedical+and+Health+Informatics+-+First+Revision&amp;title=Acta+Informatica+Medica&amp;issn=03538109&amp;date=2010-01-01&amp;volume=18&amp;issue=1&amp;spage=4&amp;au=Mantas%2C+John%3BAmmenwerth%2C+Elske%3BDemiris%2C+George%3BHasman%2C+Arie%3BHaux%2C+Reinhold%3BHersh%2C+William%3BHovenga%2C+Evelyn%3BLun%2C+K+C%3BMarin%2C+Heimar%3BMartin-Sanchez%2C+Fernando%3BWright%2C+Graham&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=Acta+Informatica+Medica&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/";ProQuest Central,SciTech Premium Collection
