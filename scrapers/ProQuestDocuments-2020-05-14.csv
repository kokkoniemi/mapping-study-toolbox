Using research methods courses to teach students about sustainable development – a three-phase model for a transformative learning experience;Purpose Learning about sustainable development in dedicated curricula can be beneficial for students’ personal and professional development and societies alike. However, for various reasons the implementation of sustainable development modules in existing curricula can be difficult in many fields of study. This paper aims to propose an alternative route to give students the chance to learn about sustainable development without the need to change the structure of their study program. Design/methodology/approach The current paper elaborates on the idea that many fields of study have mandatory courses on empirical research methods and these courses can function as a platform to teach applied empirical research methods in combination with education on sustainable development. A three-phase model is proposed to implement sustainable development topics in existing curricula, taking students’ current methodological competency level into account. Findings The proposed model provides a chance to combine education on sustainability with thorough training in scientific research methods. Example projects and evaluation results from an existing social science curriculum and its integration into a real-world laboratory on sustainable energy use illustrate the different phases and their goals. Originality/value The model offers the opportunity to implement education on sustainability into existing curricula without the need for difficult structural changes. It extends students’ learning on sustainability without impairing their learning of research methods. A discussion of the model’s limitations and boundary conditions helps to understand its potential use cases and challenges.;2392927725;;;Scholarly Journals;;"Müller, Patrick A;Bäumer, Thomas;Silberer, Jan;Zimmermann, Stefan";;;; © 2020.

Applying Agile across the IT Curriculum;Agile is emerging as a new paradigm for organizations across a variety of industry sectors because Agile helps teams manage and adapt quickly to change. In order to provide our students with workforce ready skills and better performance in group projects, a regional campus Computer and Information Technology (CIT) department began implementing Agile across its curriculum. After a visit to a local business who underwent an Agile transformation and is now using Agile for all their teams, they said that understanding the culture of Agile is more important than the practices themselves. Revising our curriculum allows us to give our students the advantage of learning how to be Agile and what it means to thrive in an Agile culture.;2396852371; EJ1246230;;Scholarly Journals;;"Hulshult, Andrea;Woods, David M.";;;;;; Article , Report , 080: Journal Articles , 143: Reports - Research; 1545-679X;; Feb 2020;;;1; English; English;; 14-21;;Feb 2020;Information Systems Education Journal; Scholarly Journals , Reports;2020; http://isedj.org; ERIC, © Information Systems and Computing Academic Professionals;18;https://search.proquest.com/docview/2396852371?accountid=11774;;;;;; 14;;;  5185ER5 10713ER5  5168 10669 ,  3282ER5 10713ER5  3268 10669 ,  10719ER5  10675 ,  10685ER5 4527ER5 912ER5  10642 4511 909 ,  5611ER5 9726ER5 1ER5  5592 9690 1 ,  1305ER5 8652ER5  1300 8620 ,  8473ER5 1823ER5 9339ER5 5258ER5  8442 1814 9306 5241 ,  10709ER5  10666 ,  5723ER5 2799ER5  5704 2787 ,  8284ER5  8254 ,  2532ER5 3198ER5 2799ER5  2521 3184 2787 ,  10664ER5 3241ER5 6603ER5  10621 3227 6582 ,  2065ER5 5172ER5 8290ER5 3164ER5  2054 5155 8260 3150 ,  1783ER5 3795ER5 9280ER5 3431ER5 5722ER5 4925ER5 8950ER5 8043ER5 4558ER5 8297ER5  1774 3780 9247 3417 8016 4542 5703 4908 8917 8267 ,  10608ER5 9048ER5  10565 9015; Higher Education , Postsecondary Education;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aeric&amp;atitle=Applying+Agile+across+the+IT+Curriculum&amp;title=Information+Systems+Education+Journal&amp;issn=1545-679X&amp;date=2020-02-01&amp;volume=18&amp;issue=1&amp;spage=14&amp;au=Hulshult%2C+Andrea%3BWoods%2C+David+M.&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=Information+Systems+Education+Journal&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/EJ1246230&amp;rft_id=info:doi/";Social Science Premium Collection
The use of open data as a material for learning;Open data has potential value as a material for use in learning activities. However, approaches to harnessing this are not well understood or in mainstream use in education. In this research, early adopters from a diverse range of educational projects and teaching settings were interviewed to explore their rationale for using open data in teaching, how suitable activity designs could be achieved, and the practical challenges of using open data. A thematic analysis was conducted to identify patterns and relationships in these open data-based practices that have already emerged. A document analysis of teaching materials and other related artefacts was used to augment and validate the findings. Drawing on this, common approaches and issues are identified, and a conceptual framework to support greater use of open data by educators is described. This paper also highlights where existing concepts in education and educational technology research, including inquiry-based learning, authenticity, motivation, dialogue, and personalisation can help us to understand the value and challenges of using open data in education.;2282313378;;;Scholarly Journals; The Open University, Institute of Educational Technology, Learning and Teaching Innovation, Milton Keynes, UK (GRID:grid.10837.3d) (ISNI:0000000096069301);Coughlan, Tim;;;; Educational Technology Research and Development is a copyright of Springer, (2019).

Integrating CAD/CAE/CAM in Engineering Curricula: A Project-Based Learning Approach;Problem-based learning (PBL) approaches are well-accepted and disseminated and have been intensively employed in several engineering programs. This article aims to present a teaching experience in which PBL was applied in one course of a mechanical engineering graduation program. The PBL approach applied is described step-by-step as well as the goals and constraints related to Computer-Aided Design, Engineering and Manufacturing (CAD/CAE/CAM) technologies employed in this particular case. The evaluation process is described, as well as the quantitative results, and also the results obtained from questionnaires answered by the students at the end of the PBL experience. Additionally, the team’s technical success in solving the proposed CAD/CAE/CAM problems was also taken into account. This PBL approach provided the students with the required autonomy to develop their argumentative skills within the team, defending their ideas, and at the same time, promoting self-criticism and ethical and impartial judgment among the other team members.;2397362732;;;Scholarly Journals;;"Fernandes, Fábio A O;Júnior, Nilo Fuchter;Anderson Daleffe;Fritzen, Daniel;Ricardo J Alves de Sousa";;;; © 2020.

Fostering Environmental Awareness with Smart IoT Planters in Campuses;The decrease in the cost of sensors during the last years, and the arrival of the 5th generation of mobile technology will greatly benefit Internet of Things (IoT) innovation. Accordingly, the use of IoT in new agronomic practices might be a vital part for improving soil quality, optimising water usage, or improving the environment. Nonetheless, the implementation of IoT systems to foster environmental awareness in educational settings is still unexplored. This work addresses the educational need to train students on how to design complex sensor-based IoT ecosystems. Hence, a Project-Based-Learning approach is followed to explore multidisciplinary learning processes implementing IoT systems that varied in the sensors, actuators, microcontrollers, plants, soils and irrigation system they used. Three different types of planters were implemented, namely, hydroponic system, vertical garden, and rectangular planters. This work presents three key contributions that might help to improve teaching and learning processes. First, a holistic architecture describing how IoT ecosystems can be implemented in higher education settings is presented. Second, the results of an evaluation exploring teamwork performance in multidisciplinary groups is reported. Third, alternative initiatives to promote environmental awareness in educational contexts (based on the lessons learned) are suggested. The results of the evaluation show that multidisciplinary work including students from different expertise areas is highly beneficial for learning as well as on the perception of quality of the work obtained by the whole group. These conclusions rekindle the need to encourage work in multidisciplinary teams to train engineers for Industry 4.0 in Higher Education.;2391793718;;;Scholarly Journals;;"Tabuenca, Bernardo;García-Alcántara, Vicente;Gilarranz-Casado, Carlos;Barrado-Aguirre, Samuel";;;; © 2020.

Evaluating Activation and Absence of Negative Effect: Gamification and Escape Rooms for Learning;"Innovation has allowed for and developed new ways of teaching and learning. Gamification is among the new training methodologies, which is a didactic approach based on the game structure with an attractive component for students. Within gamification, flipped learning and problem-based learning, escape rooms can be found as a technical aspect, which is focused on providing enigmas and tracks for the various educational content that students have assimilated through learning based on problem solving. The aim of this study is to identify how the use of gamification with the use of educational escape rooms affects activation and absence of a negative effect on students. 61 Master students of the Autonomous City of Ceuta participated in this case study. They were divided into three study groups (1 control group; 2 experimental groups) that followed different formative actions (control group—traditional; experimental groups—escape rooms). To achieve the objectives, a mixed research design based on quantitative and qualitative techniques was followed. The instrument used for data collection was the GAMEX (Gameful Experience Scale). The results reveal that the students who had taken a gamified formative action through escape rooms obtained better assessment results in the indicators concerning motivation, teamwork, commitment, activation, and absence of a negative effect on the learning process than those with the traditional methodology.";2384571634;;;Scholarly Journals;;"López-Belmonte, Jesús;Segura-Robles, Adrian;Fuentes-Cabrera, Arturo;Parra-González, María Elena";;;; © 2020.

Teaching Natural Language Processing through Big Data Text Summarization with Problem-Based Learning;Natural language processing (NLP) covers a large number of topics and tasks related to data and information management, leading to a complex and challenging teaching process. Meanwhile, problem-based learning is a teaching technique specifically designed to motivate students to learn efficiently, work collaboratively, and communicate effectively. With this aim, we developed a problem-based learning course for both undergraduate and graduate students to teach NLP. We provided student teams with big data sets, basic guidelines, cloud computing resources, and other aids to help different teams in summarizing two types of big collections: Web pages related to events, and electronic theses and dissertations (ETDs). Student teams then deployed different libraries, tools, methods, and algorithms to solve the task of big data text summarization. Summarization is an ideal problem to address learning NLP since it involves all levels of linguistics, as well as many of the tools and techniques used by NLP practitioners. The evaluation results showed that all teams generated coherent and readable summaries. Many summaries were of high quality and accurately described their corresponding events or ETD chapters, and the teams produced them along with NLP pipelines in a single semester. Further, both undergraduate and graduate students gave statistically significant positive feedback, relative to other courses in the Department of Computer Science. Accordingly, we encourage educators in the data and information management field to use our approach or similar methods in their teaching and hope that other researchers will also use our data sets and synergistic solutions to approach the new and challenging tasks we addressed.;2384385480;;;Scholarly Journals; Department of Computer Science, Virginia Tech, VA 24061, USA , Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Virginia Tech, VA 24061, USA;"Li, Liuqing;Geissinger, Jack;Ingram, William A;Fox, Edward A";;;; © 2020.

What makes an online problem-based group successful? A learning analytics study using social network analysis;"Background Although there is a wealth of research focusing on PBL, most studies employ self-reports, surveys, and interviews as data collection methods and have an exclusive focus on students. There is little research that has studied interactivity in online PBL settings through the lens of Social Network Analysis (SNA) to explore both student and teacher factors that could help monitor and possibly proactively support PBL groups. This study adopts SNA to investigate how groups, tutors and individual student’s interactivity variables correlate with group performance and whether the interactivity variables could be used to predict group performance. Methods We do so by analyzing 60 groups’ work in 12 courses in dental education (598 students). The interaction data were extracted from a Moodle-based online learning platform to construct the aggregate networks of each group. SNA variables were calculated at the group level, students’ level and tutor’s level. We then performed correlation tests and multiple regression analysis using SNA measures and performance data. Results The findings demonstrate that certain interaction variables are indicative of a well-performing group; particularly the quantity of interactions, active and reciprocal interactions among students, and group cohesion measures (transitivity and reciprocity). A more dominating role for teachers may be a negative sign of group performance. Finally, a stepwise multiple regression test demonstrated that SNA centrality measures could be used to predict group performance. A significant equation was found, F (4, 55) = 49.1, p  &lt; 0.01, with an R2 of 0.76. Tutor Eigen centrality, user count, and centralization outdegree were all statistically significant and negative. However, reciprocity in the group was a positive predictor of group improvement. Conclusions The findings of this study emphasized the importance of interactions, equal participation and inclusion of all group members, and reciprocity and group cohesion as predictors of a functioning group. Furthermore, SNA could be used to monitor online PBL groups, identify important quantitative data that helps predict and potentially support groups to function and co-regulate, which would improve the outcome of interacting groups in PBL. The information offered by SNA requires relatively little effort to analyze and could help educators get valuable insights about their groups and individual collaborators.";2378937555;;;Scholarly Journals;;"Saqr, Mohammed;Nouri, Jalal;Vartiainen, Henriikka;Malmberg, Jonna";;;; © 2020.

Effectiveness of Blended Learning in Nursing Education;Currently, teaching in higher education is being heavily developed by learning management systems that record the learning behaviour of both students and teachers. The use of learning management systems that include project-based learning and hypermedia resources increases safer learning, and it is proven to be effective in degrees such as nursing. In this study, we worked with 120 students in the third year of nursing degree. Two types of blended learning were applied (more interaction in learning management systems with hypermedia resources vs. none). Supervised learning techniques were applied: linear regression and k-means clustering. The results indicated that the type of blended learning in use predicted 40.4% of student learning outcomes. It also predicted 71.9% of the effective learning behaviors of students in learning management systems. It therefore appears that blended learning applied in Learning Management System (LMS) with hypermedia resources favors greater achievement of effective learning. Likewise, with this type of Blended Learning (BL) a larger number of students were found to belong to the intermediate cluster, suggesting that this environment strengthens better results in a larger number of students. BL with hypermedia resources and project-based learning increase students´ learning outcomes and interaction in learning management systems. Future research will be aimed at verifying these results in other nursing degree courses.;2372039986;;;Scholarly Journals;;"María Consuelo Sáiz-Manzanares;María-Camino Escolar-Llamazares;Álvar Arnaiz González";;;; © 2020.

Immersive virtual reality to enforce teaching in engineering education;Prior studies on the use of digital prototyping and virtual reality (VR) in designing as well as evaluating new products have shown that VR reduces both development time and costs whilst augmenting student motivation and creativity. The current study demonstrates that VR and 3D prototyping in the context of project-based learning (PBL) promote effective communication, increase problem solving skills, and enhance learning outcomes. VR and digital prototyping have been extensively used in industries for the purpose of product design and usability evaluation. In the context of engineering education, many research studies have attempted to explore the effect of VR on teamwork, engagement, retention, and motivation. In this paper, VR is used in conjunction with PBL in self-directed approach to design and implement a product using 3D software whilst also using virtual reality immersive CAVE display to evaluate their design. The hypothesis is that the use of VR with a project-based-learning approach to facilitate the attainment of desirable goals in the engineering design project, improved achievement of course learning outcomes and promoted effective communication. According to the research findings, VR approach significantly affected the distribution of cumulative project grades. Students’ project grades improved, particularly the implementation component. In addition, the course outcomes related to project design were better achieved in VR approach. The communication and problem-solving skills were improved in the VR approach as compared to traditional approach.;2359905953;;;Scholarly Journals; Qatar University, Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Doha, Qatar (GRID:grid.412603.2) (ISNI:0000 0004 0634 1084);Halabi Osama;;;; Multimedia Tools and Applications is a copyright of Springer, (2019).

Makerspaces in First-Year Engineering Education;Langara College, as one of the leading undergraduate institutions in the province of British Columbia (BC), offers the “Applied Science for Engineering” two-year diploma program as well as the “Engineering Transfer” two-semester certificate program. Three project-based courses are offered as part of the two-year diploma program in Applied Science (APSC) and Computer Science (CPSC) departments: “APSC 1010—Engineering and Technology in Society”, “CPSC 1090—Engineering Graphics”, and “CPSC 1490—Applications of Microcontrollers”, with CPSC 1090 and CPSC 1490 also part of the Engineering Transfer curriculum. Although the goals, scopes, objectives, and evaluation criteria of these courses are different, the main component of all three courses is a group-based technical project. Engineering students have access to Langara College’s Makerspace for the hands-on component of their project. Makerspaces expand experiential learning opportunities and allows students to gain a skillset outside the traditional classroom. This paper begins with a detailed review of the maker movement and the impact of makerspace in higher education. Different forms of makerspace and the benefits of incorporating them on first-year students’ creativity, sense of community, self-confidence, and entrepreneurial skills are discussed. This paper introduces Langara’s engineering program and its project-based design courses. Langara’s interdisciplinary makerspace, its goals and objectives, equipment, and some sample projects are introduced in this paper in detail. We then explain how the group-project component of APSC 1010, CPSC 1090, and CPSC 1490 are managed and how using makerspace improves students’ performance in such projects. In conclusion, the paper describes the evaluation of learning outcomes via an anonymous student survey.;2330817727;;;Scholarly Journals;;"Taheri, Pooya;Robbins, Philip;Maalej, Sirine";;" Massachusetts Institute of Technology

Formative assessment scores in tutorial sessions correlates with OSCE and progress testing scores in a PBL medical curriculum;Background : Effective assessments programs are a challenge in problem-based learning (PBL). One of the main principles of this educational setting is the Formative Assessment (FA). We hypothesized that students’ performance assessed by FA in tutorial sessions in a PBL curriculum is related to other summative assessments. Objective : To investigate the correlation among FA in tutorial sessions with grades obtained in Objective Structured Clinical Evaluation (OSCE) and Progress Testing (PT) to better understand the assessment process in PBL medical teaching approach and to predict student’s future performance. Design : An observational cross-sectional study was conducted comparing FA, OSCE and PT scores from 4th to 8th semester medical students. Correlation analyses were performed using pooled and separate data from the 4th and 8th semesters. Results : From the 5th to 8th semester, OSCE scores were smaller compared to the FA, while PT scores were lower in all stages. In the pooled data, the correlation analysis showed a significant positive relationship between grades on FA and OSCE, FA and PT and OSCE and PT. A significant correlation among the three assessments strategies was also detected in the 8 th semester, but not in the 4th semester. Conclusions : Assessment strategies in PBL approach, including FA, OSCE and PT, have positive correlations, which increases as the medical course becomes more complex.;2351037580;;;Scholarly Journals; Department of Medicine, University of Ribeirão Preto, Ribeirão Preto, Brazil , Department of Medicine, University of Ribeirão Preto, Ribeirão Preto, Brazil , Department of Medicine, University of Ribeirão Preto, Ribeirão Preto, Brazil , Pharm & Tox Department, COM-Michigan State University, Lansing, MI, USA , Department of Medicine, University of Ribeirão Preto, Ribeirão Preto, Brazil , Department of Medicine, University of Ribeirão Preto, Ribeirão Preto, Brazil , Department of Medicine, University of Ribeirão Preto, Ribeirão Preto, Brazil;"Couto, Lucélio B;Durand, Marina T;Wolff, Amora C D;Restini, Carolina B A;Faria, Milton, Jr;Gustavo Salata Romão;Bestetti, Reinaldo B";;;; © 2018 The Author(s).

An Overview of Teaching Physics for Undergraduates in Engineering Environments;"This paper is an overview of approaches to teaching physics courses delivered to students of engineering disciplines. It addresses, first, the history of teaching physics to engineering students starting in the early 20th century, then reviews the main issues presented and discussed over the last decade in a series of conferences on Physics Teaching in Engineering Education (PTEE). Finally, this paper discusses more contemporary views on the subject, including the latest technologies and new methodologies. It is not a critical review of teaching physics to engineering students, but rather a summary of various views and approaches over the span of the entire century. The common denominator of the study is the relevance to the competency-based approach: how the papers focus on teaching engineers the principles of physics in a manner that contributes to success in their professional careers.&#xa0;";2317099769;;;Scholarly Journals;;"Zalewski, Janusz;Novak, Gregor;Carlson, Randall E";;;; © 2019.

Pharmacy Students' Standardized Self-Assessment of Interprofessional Skills During an Objective Structured Clinical Examination;"Objective. To examine pharmacy students' self-assessment and evaluator assessment of the global performance of skills required for effective interprofessional collaborative practice during an objective structured clinical examination (OSCE). Methods. Third-year pharmacy students completed three cases designed to evaluate the skills they would need to engage in effective interprofessional collaborative practice as part of a capstone objective structured clinical examination (OSCE). Students then also completed a brief survey regarding the quality of the cases and the Interprofessional Collaborative Competency Attainment Survey (ICCAS). Student performance on each of the three cases was assessed using the Global Rating Scale (GRS). Paired sample t tests were conducted to compare differences in mean change in ICCAS scores. Correlations between the GRS ratings and ICCAS pre- and post-assessment scores and changes in scores were examined. Results. One hundred twenty-four students participated in the study. The majority of students reported that the OSCE cases were realistic and of high quality. The average total ICCAS score (out of 7) was 5.1 (SD=0.8) at pre-assessment and 5.9 (SD = 0.6) at post-assessment; the difference in scores was significant. The mean GRS scores (out of 5 points) for the three cases were 4.2 (SD = 0.5), 4.5 (SD=0.6), and 4.6 (SD = 0.5); and the mean score for the three cases combined was 4.4 (SD=0.3). A weak relationship was found between the total GRS and ICCAS post-assessment scores. Conclusion. Presenting pharmacy students with OSCE cases that focused on skills important to effective interprofessional collaborative practice was an effective means of assessing their skills and improving their self-assessment of interprofessional collaborative behaviors.";2354878140;;;Scholarly Journals; State University of New York at Buffalo, School of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Buffalo, New York , State University of New York at Buffalo, School of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Buffalo, New York , State University of New York at Buffalo, School of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Buffalo, New York , University at Buffalo School of Nursing, Buffalo, New York , Erie County Medical Center, Buffalo, New York;"Doloresco, Fred, PharmD, MS;Maerten-Rivera, Jaime, PhD;Zhao, Yichen;Foltz-Ramos, Kelly, PhD;Fusco, Nicholas M, PharmD";;;; Copyright American Association of Colleges of Pharmacy 2019;; Journal Article;;; 2019;;0002-9459;10; English; English;; 2142-2149; Alexandria;2019;American Journal of Pharmaceutical Education;;2019;;;83;https://search.proquest.com/docview/2354878140?accountid=11774;;;;;; 2142;;; Standard deviation , Interprofessional education , Drug stores , Students , Self evaluation , Collaboration , Professionals , Teams , Verbal communication , Pharmacists;;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aeducation&amp;atitle=Pharmacy+Students%27+Standardized+Self-Assessment+of+Interprofessional+Skills+During+an+Objective+Structured+Clinical+Examination&amp;title=American+Journal+of+Pharmaceutical+Education&amp;issn=00029459&amp;date=2019-11-30&amp;volume=83&amp;issue=10&amp;spage=2142&amp;au=Doloresco%2C+Fred%2C+PharmD%2C+MS%3BMaerten-Rivera%2C+Jaime%2C+PhD%3BZhao%2C+Yichen%3BFoltz-Ramos%2C+Kelly%2C+PhD%3BFusco%2C+Nicholas+M%2C+PharmD&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=American+Journal+of+Pharmaceutical+Education&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/";ProQuest Central,Social Science Premium Collection
Vigilante Innovation (VIX): case study on the development of student skills through a team-based design process and environment;Background Many undergraduate students majoring in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields lack experience in collaborative thinking, limiting their effectiveness as they enter careers in academic and industrial environments. The SyBBURE Searle Undergraduate Research Program has incorporated a team-based design component into its curriculum to fill this gap in training. This design framework, called Vigilante Innovation (VIX) to highlight its emphasis on self-initiation and action, has evolved into a multi-semester-long group undertaking that combines just-in-time training in entrepreneurship and project design with student-driven collaborations aimed at solving a real-world problem. We hypothesize that this framework provides a hands-on, realistic workplace simulation task through which students can develop an understanding of teamwork. Results Using a case-study approach, we discuss the development of the VIX design framework since its inception in 2014 and assess the impact of the VIX framework on student learning and growth using a student survey from 2016 to 2017 and student interviews from 2018. Conclusions A flexible approach, an annualized project timeline, a student-driven prototyping space, and self-selecting project areas emerged as key contributors to the successful implementation of the VIX design and to deepened student learning. The diversity of VIX teams, the self-reported success of student projects, and student interviews indicate that students who participate in VIX possess an in-depth understanding of team-based strategies. These findings support the VIX framework as an effective method of providing undergraduates in STEM fields with efficient and meaningful exposure to the team-based entrepreneurial skills that are vital in their future careers. Additional work is needed to determine if this approach has a long-term impact on student success in team-based environments.

[...]the aim of this study was to understand whether a such a peer-led club with a prehealth focus could foster both continuing engagement and development in participants' critical thinking, a skill they would need as they moved into graduate-level coursework. [...]did participants value their experience, even though they received no credit? [...]participants with an interest but no knowledge of health diagnosis were able to begin to use CT, albeit in a limited way, to find defensible answers, and as one later remarked, ""to understand how competing ideas can inform decision-making.""";2292894369;;;Scholarly Journals; Department of Educational Services and Leadership, Rowan University, Glassboro, NJ , Cooper Medical School, Rowan University, Camden, NJ;"Thompson, Carol C, PhD;Opalack, Kelsey, BS";;;; Copyright Association of Schools of Allied Health Professions Fall 2019;; Journal Article;;; Fall 2019;;0090-7421;3; English; English;; E69-E72; Washington;Fall 2019;Journal of Allied Health;;2019;;;48;https://search.proquest.com/docview/2292894369?accountid=11774;;;;;; E69;;; Collaboration , Etiology , Health , Etiology , Instructional design , Extracurricular activities , College students , Age , Taxonomy , Cognitive development , Cognitive ability , Critical thinking , Core curriculum , Cognitive ability , Decision making , Problem based learning , Etiology , Independent study , Education , Cognition & reasoning , Decision making , Professions , Skills , San Francisco California;;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aeducation&amp;atitle=How+a+Student-led+Health+Professions+Club+Modeled+Teamwork+and+Critical+Thinking+for+Prospective+Health+Practitioners&amp;title=Journal+of+Allied+Health&amp;issn=00907421&amp;date=2019-10-01&amp;volume=48&amp;issue=3&amp;spage=E69&amp;au=Thompson%2C+Carol+C%2C+PhD%3BOpalack%2C+Kelsey%2C+BS&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=Journal+of+Allied+Health&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/";ProQuest Central,SciTech Premium Collection,Social Science Premium Collection
Supporting Project-Based Learning through Economical and Flexible Learning Spaces;In spite of the aforementioned advantages of ALCs, their adoption comes at a cost. Since ALCs are very different than a traditional classroom or lecture hall, both in layout and classroom technology, constructing ALCs or retrofitting existing spaces can be expensive [15]. Specifically, the algorithmic understanding and data structuring required lends itself towards a more visual presentation format than readily attainable within time utilizing a BYOD approach. [...]the whiteboards available in the ALC/PALS environments were employed to a high degree, especially towards the second half of the semester. Costs to construct or retrofit an existing classroom into a more traditional ALC (e.g., SCALE-UP) will vary greatly depending on the extent of the renovations needed but figures over $100,000 US dollars are reported in the literature [15]. [...]the savings of constructing a PALS or HBS learning space over a traditional ALC are substantial. In terms of functionality, a PALS system offers a few additional features such as the ability to monitor all student stations via a WebUI, recording what is displayed on student stations and remote access and control of the system.

Results Analysis of Russian Students’ Participation in the Online International Educational Project X-Culture;Focus groups are advantageous in that they facilitate participant interaction and discussion, especially when time is limited. [...]focus groups may elicit more information than a one-on-one interview when participants are hesitant to provide information or elaborate. Choosing between the ambitions of improving skills or achieving results, the student told about the goal of professional development, which refers to the development of human competence. Since the process of developing professional competencies in this case was more important than the result, the student noted a high degree of interest in the project and constant self-motivation throughout the project. [...]the experience of participating in an international educational project had a positive impact on the level of development of students’ language competence. First of all, it does not take into account a novelty effect—students did not have before this experiment an experience of project-based learning class.;2313563101;;;Scholarly Journals;;"Zakharova, Irina;Kobicheva, Aleksandra;Rozova, Natalia";;;; © 2019.

Active Learning Approaches to Teaching Soil Science at the College Level;Traditional passive approaches to teaching, such as lectures, are not particularly effective at promoting student learning, or at developing the qualities that employers seek in graduates from soil science programs, such as problem-solving and critical thinking skills. In contrast, active learning approaches have been shown to promote these very qualities in students. Here I discuss my use of active learning approaches to teach soil science at the introductory and advanced levels, with particular focus on problem-based learning, and combined just-in-time teaching and peer instruction. A brief description of the each pedagogical approach is followed by evidence of its impact on student learning in general and, when available, its use in soil science courses. I describe and discuss my experiences using these approaches teaching introductory soil science (face-to-face and online), soil chemistry and soil microbiology courses, and provide examples of some of the problems I use. I have found the benefits to student learning in terms of student engagement, ownership of learning, and development of critical thinking and problem-solving skills easily outweigh are clear relative to traditional, passive approaches to teaching.;2281106337;;;Scholarly Journals;;Amador, Jose A;;" Prentice Hall Inc

Managing the Team Project Process: Helpful Hints and Tools to Ease the Workload without Sacrificing Learning Objectives;Students can explore playful environments offered by serious games to simulate challenges in the process of launching and managing a start-up, which can improve their strategic planning and management skills. In this sense, this paper identifies and explores the benefits and limitations of the use of serious games in entrepreneurship education. Subsequently, it is discussed how these elements are approached in the context of nine entrepreneurship serious games. The findings indicate that all considered games create an active learning environment, although it is not clear how they can be integrated into a didactical system and how the students' performance could be evaluated and assessed. Additionally, there were also globally identified accessibility, interoperability and usability issues.;2383035258;;;Scholarly Journals; Faculty of Engineering of Oporto University, University of Porto & INESC TEC Porto, Portugal , Polytechnic Institute of Gaya, ISPGaya, Portugal;"Almeida, Fernando;Simões, Jorge";;;; Copyright Australian Business Education Research Association 2019;; Journal Article;;; 2019;;;2; English; English;; 35-54; Sunnybank Hills;2019;The e - Journal of Business Education & Scholarship of Teaching;;2019;;;13;https://search.proquest.com/docview/2383035258?accountid=11774;;;;;; 35;;; Teaching , Simulation , Motivation , Students , Active learning , Gamification , Entrepreneurship education , Educational technology , Teamwork , Entrepreneurs , Social entrepreneurship , Feedback , Games , Startups , Education , Skills;;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aabiglobal&amp;atitle=Managing+the+Team+Project+Process%3A+Helpful+Hints+and+Tools+to+Ease+the+Workload+without+Sacrificing+Learning+Objectives&amp;title=The+e+-+Journal+of+Business+Education+%26+Scholarship+of+Teaching&amp;issn=&amp;date=2019-07-01&amp;volume=13&amp;issue=2&amp;spage=35&amp;au=Almeida%2C+Fernando%3BSim%C3%B5es%2C+Jorge&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=The+e+-+Journal+of+Business+Education+%26+Scholarship+of+Teaching&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/";ProQuest Central,Social Science Premium Collection
Fostering Professional Competencies in Engineering Undergraduates with [email protected];"Since the engineering practice deals with the environment, professional ethics and behaviours, matters of health and safety, and discipline [3], additionally, this paper advocates the need to foster sustainable development (SD) and socio-professional ethics (SPE) (the two Ss) in the engineering practice. According to the Engineering Council [11], Bachelor’s degrees with honours are awarded to students who have demonstrated the following: 1. systematic understanding, including the acquisition of coherent and detailed knowledge, and conceptual understanding to critically evaluate, make judgements, and frame appropriate questions to achieve a solution—or identify a range of solutions—to a problem; 2. awareness of the uncertainty, ambiguity, and limits of knowledge; 3. ability to accurately apply methods and techniques of analysis and enquiry to review, consolidate, and extend their knowledge and understanding and to initiate and carry out projects; 4. ability to communicate information, ideas, problems, and solutions to both specialist and nonspecialist audiences. 5. ability to manage their own learning and to make use of scholarly reviews and primary sources. Specifically, ABET specifies under Criterion 3 the so-called a–k list of student outcomes [14]. [...]according to a survey distributed to USA employers by the National Association of Colleges and Employers (NACE) [15], the three most important skills of an engineer today are (i) the ability to communicate and work in teams; (ii) the ability to solve or troubleshoot problems in new or unfamiliar situations; and (iii) knowledge of a specific engineering discipline. According to the team, the product should “create a unique environment for the pet owner, where functionalities meet the client needs” [31]. [...]the final goal was to design, develop, and build a system allowing the pet owner not only to check the location of the pet but also to monitor and share on social media its daily level of activity.";2313726761;;;Scholarly Journals;;"Malheiro, Benedita;Guedes, Pedro;Silva, Manuel F;Ferreira, Paulo";;;; © 2019.

Problem-based learning in clinical bioinformatics education: Does it help to create communities of practice?;"We have now reached the genomics era within medicine; genomics is being used to personalise treatment, make diagnoses, prognoses, and predict adverse outcomes resulting from treatment with certain drugs. Genomic data is now abundant in healthcare, and the newly created profession of clinical bioinformaticians are responsible for its analysis. In the United Kingdom, clinical bioinformaticians are trained within a 3-year programme, integrating a work-based placement with a part-time Master’s degree. As this profession is still developing, trainees can feel isolated from their peers whom are located in other hospitals and can find it difficult to gain the mentorship that they require to complete their training. Building strong networks or communities of practice (CoPs) and allowing sharing of knowledge and experiences is one solution to addressing this isolation. Within the Master’s delivered at the University of Manchester, we have integrated group-centred problem-based learning (PBL) using real clinical case studies worked on during each course unit. This approach is combined with a flipped style of teaching providing access to online content in our Virtual Learning Environment before the course. The face-to-face teaching is used to focus on the application of the students’ knowledge to clinical case studies. In this study, we conducted semistructured interviews with 8 students, spanning 3 cohorts of students. We evaluated the effectiveness of this style of teaching and whether it had contributed to the formation of CoPs between our students. Our findings demonstrated that this style of teaching was preferred by our students to a more traditional lecture-based format and that the problem-based learning approach enabled the formation of CoPs within these cohorts. These CoPs are valuable in the development of this new profession and assist with the production of new guidelines and policies that are helping to professionalise this new group of healthcare scientists.";2250648735;;;Scholarly Journals;;"Davies, Angela C;Harris, Diane;Banks-Gatenby, Amanda;Brass, Andy";;" University of Manchester

project-/problem-based learning in STEM: impacts on student learning;"According to Volkema (2010): ""There is a set of sociocultural skills that are central to the effective functioning of a project management team. According to Johnson, et al., ""Individuals who approach a learning situation with the goal of developing their skills rather than the goal of performing well, are said to have adopted a Mastery Goal Orientation (MGO) in that context (also often referred to as a learning goal orientation) and are, therefore, more likely to benefit from that learning experience"" (p. 2). According to Stolk and Harari (2014), ""Research shows that several aspects of motivation are particularly important in cognitively demanding tasks: goal orientation, perceived value, and self-efficacy. According to Savelsbergh, Gevers, van der Heijden, &amp; Poell, (2012), ""Teachers/instructors need to act as project managers who perceive signals of individual or shared role stress and should stimulate members to collectively explore and reflect on the role division in the team; opening up the opportunity to experiment with a different role division and a reallocation of resources, to safeguard the effectiveness of the individual team members as well as of the team as a whole (p. 24).""";2226387176;;;Scholarly Journals;;Euefueno, William D;;" International Technology Education Association

The Application of Problem-based Learning Approach in English Grammar Instruction: A Pilot Study;The study incorporates the problem-based approach (PBL) in the English class with an attempt to improve English low achievers' grammar competence pertaining to relative clauses and their motivation in learning English. Fifty students divided into seven teams with leader for each were recruited. This study adopts the pre- and post-test research design as well as classroom observation checklist and two assignments. The result indicates that the engagement level of the participants is increased by the scenario-based strategy and their grammar competence improves under PBL instruction after being compared with the scores of pretest and posttest, which suggests that the PBL approach really exerts a positive influence on the performance of the participant. The finding also implies that the participants emphasizes, when offering solutions to the scenario, more on employment than on studies, which may reflect their real life experiences.;2224304811;;;Scholarly Journals; Department of English Language & Literature, Chinese Culture University, Taipei, Taiwan;Chiou, Bella;;;; Copyright Academy Publication Co., Ltd.

Pedagogy and public-funded research: an exploratory study of skills in digital humanities projects;"Purpose Public-funded research in digital humanities (DH) enhances institutional and individual research missions and contributes open data to a growing base of globally networked knowledge. The Digging into Data 3 challenge (DID3) (2014–2016) is an international, interdisciplinary and collaborative grant initiative, and the purpose of this paper is to explore skills that faculty and students brought to projects and others they acquired and shared on collaborative teams. Design/methodology/approach Rooted in the naturalistic paradigm, this qualitative case study centers on semi-structured interviews with 53 participants on 11 of the 14 DID3 projects. Documentary evidence complements empirical evidence; analysis is constructivist and grounded. Findings Hailing from diverse academic research institutions, centers and repositories, participants brought 20 types of discipline-based or interdisciplinary expertise to DID3 projects. But they reported acquiring or refining 27 other skills during their project work. While most are data-related, complementary programming, management and analytical skills push disciplinary expertise toward new frontiers. Project-based learning and pedagogy function symbiotically; participants therefore advocate for aligning problem-solving skills with pedagogical objectives at home institutions to prepare for public-funded DH projects. A modified content analysis juxtaposes DID3 skills with those advanced in 23 recent DH syllabi to identify commonalities and gaps. Originality/value Pedagogy has an important yet under-researched and underdeveloped role in public-funded DH research.";2218811371;;;Scholarly Journals; College of Computing and Informatics, Drexel University, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA , College of Computing and Informatics, Drexel University, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA;"Garwood, Deborah A;Poole, Alex H";;;; © Emerald Publishing Limited 2018; 10.1108/JD-06-2018-0094; Journal Article;;; 2019;;0022-0418;3; English; English;; 550-576; Bradford;2019;Journal of Documentation;;2019;;;76;https://search.proquest.com/docview/2218811371?accountid=11774;;;;; 2018-06-16 (Received) , 2018-10-29 (Revised) , 2018-10-31 (Accepted); 550;;; Teaching , Pedagogy , Students , Collaboration , Datasets , Science , Skills , Interdisciplinary aspects , Content analysis , Library and information science , Empirical analysis , Core curriculum , Problem solving , Research methodology , Project management , Text analysis , Missions , Reading comprehension , Social networks , Scholars , Archives & records , Repositories , Natural language processing , Literature reviews , Libraries , Digital humanities , Scholarly communication , Research & development--R&D , Canada , United Kingdom--UK; Skills , Data handling , Data literacy , Information literacy , Digital humanities pedagogy , Information and library science , Public-funded research;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aabiglobal&amp;atitle=Pedagogy+and+public-funded+research%3A+an+exploratory+study+of+skills+in+digital+humanities+projects&amp;title=Journal+of+Documentation&amp;issn=00220418&amp;date=2019-05-01&amp;volume=76&amp;issue=3&amp;spage=550&amp;au=Garwood%2C+Deborah+A%3BPoole%2C+Alex+H&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=Journal+of+Documentation&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/10.1108%2FJD-06-2018-0094";Art, Design & Architecture Collection,ProQuest Central,SciTech Premium Collection,Social Science Premium Collection
The Effect of Problem Based Learning Approach in Information Technologies and Software Course on Academic Achievement of Students;"The purpose of this research is to reveal the impact of problem based learning approach on academic achievement of 6th grade students who are taking Information Technologies and Software course. Quantitative and qualitative methods were used together in the research. The study group of the research consists of 43 6th grade students studying at a secondary school in the academic year 2016-2017. In the research, in order to collect data, an achievement test, a student performance evaluation form, a groupmate evaluation form and an interview form on determining the opinions of students on problem based learning were used. When analyzing research data, both qualitative and quantitative analysis methods were used. When we look at the results of the research; it was concluded that the problem based learning approach has increased the success in information technology and software course. In addition, when the opinions of experimental group students on their groupmates were examined, it was found that the students generally adopt group work and are striving to be active, aware of their responsibilities and care about the human relations within the group. After the opinions of the teacher using the method on the student performances, some students in some groups were found to be very successful in solving problems by fulfilling their duties and responsibilities in general, or taking leadership roles while some were failed. Experiment group students seem to have positive views on the method supporting co-operation, ensuring active participation and persistent learning.

Developing a Framework to Understand Student Engagement, Team Dynamics, and Learning Outcomes Using ERPsim;The value of enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems to business organizations has long been recognized with their use being integrated into educational business curricula and training. ERPsim games incorporate live business simulations that enable students to learn about ERP concepts firsthand by working in teams and managing their own companies using SAP ERP software. Prior research has examined the use of ERPsim and learning outcomes, yet to date, there is little if any research that has explored the association of learning outcomes with student engagement and team dynamics, two areas that have continued to grow in importance in many business school programs. This research develops and tests a model to examine these relationships. Validated constructs and a validated survey instrument are created and verified. Study results indicate a positive association between student engagement, team dynamics, and learning outcomes. Results and implications are discussed, and recommendations for further research are presented.;2238480861;;;Scholarly Journals; College of Business Administration Rider University , School of Business Administration Widener University , Department of Accounting and MIS Lerner College of Business and Economics University of Delaware;"Eder, Lauren B;Antonucci, Yvonne L;Monk, Ellen F";;;; Copyright EDSIG Spring 2019;; Journal Article;;; Spring 2019;;1055-3096;2; English; English;; 127-140; West Lafayette;Spring 2019;Journal of Information Systems Education;;2019;;;30;https://search.proquest.com/docview/2238480861?accountid=11774;;;;;; 127;;; Teaching , Problem solving , Information systems , Software , Higher education , Collaboration , Model testing , Curricula , Accreditation , Student participation , Enterprise resource planning , Curricula , Business , Games , Computer simulation , Internet resources , Enterprise resource planning , Simulation , Learning , Teams , Hypotheses , Business education , Problem based learning , Montreal Quebec Canada , New York;;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aabiglobal&amp;atitle=Developing+a+Framework+to+Understand+Student+Engagement%2C+Team+Dynamics%2C+and+Learning+Outcomes+Using+ERPsim&amp;title=Journal+of+Information+Systems+Education&amp;issn=10553096&amp;date=2019-04-01&amp;volume=30&amp;issue=2&amp;spage=127&amp;au=Eder%2C+Lauren+B%3BAntonucci%2C+Yvonne+L%3BMonk%2C+Ellen+F&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=Journal+of+Information+Systems+Education&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/";ProQuest Central,SciTech Premium Collection,Social Science Premium Collection
Engineering Projects in Community Service (EPICS) in High Schools: Subtle but Potentially Important Student Gains Detected from Human-Centered Curriculum Design;A major goal in Engineering training in the U.S. is to continue to both grow and diversify the field. Project- and service-based forms of experiential, problem-based learning are often implemented with this as a goal, and Engineering Projects in Community Service (EPICS) High is one of the more well-regarded and widely implemented. Yet, the evidence based on if and how participation in such programs shapes student intentions and commitment to STEM pathways is currently limited, most especially for pre-college programming. This study asks: How do high school students’ engineering mindsets and their views of engineering/engineers change as they participate in project–service learning (as implemented through an EPICS High curriculum)? This study employed a mixed method design, combining pre- and post-test survey data that were collected from 259 matched students (63% minority, 43% women) enrolling in EPICS High (total of 536 completed pre-tests, 375 completed post-tests) alongside systematic ethnographic analysis of participant observation data conducted in the same 13 socioeconomically diverse schools over a two-year period. Statistical analyses showed that participants score highly on engineering-related concepts and attitudes at both pre- and post-test. These did not change significantly as a result of participation. However, we detected nuanced but potentially important changes in student perspectives and meaning, such as shifting perceptions of engineering and gaining key transversal skills. The value of participation to participants was connected to changes in the meaning of commitments to pursue engineering/STEM.;2309541403;;;Scholarly Journals;;"Ruth, Alissa;Hackman, Joseph;Brewis, Alexandra;Spence, Tameka;Luchmun, Rachel;Velez, Jennifer;Ganesh, Tirupalavanam G";;" Department of Education

Promotion of the Environmental Knowledge and Behavior through the Moroccan Syllabus of Sciences in the Middle School;"This research paper aims to promote environmental knowledge and behavior in the Moroccan school through the syllabus of science at the level of the Moroccan middle School. As a first step, a comparative multi-case study was conducted. It is intended for students from four middle Schools who belong to four different socio-environmental backgrounds. The survey was conducted through questionnaires which consist of four sections; the learning methods, the teaching aids, environmental knowledge, and the use of environmental knowledge in adequate eco-responsible behaviors. Based on the analysis of the results obtained at the level of the four schools, a teaching intervention of four weeks (2 hours per week) was then carried out. During this process, the same program was taught but otherwise. In order to meet the objectives of this work, we have inserted some local environmental problems through active learning methods and relatively appropriate teaching aids. In our intervention, we have made the necessary link between ecological knowledge and the appropriate pro-environmental behavior. This, however, is attributed to the fact that it has never been used before. The results show that there is a significant improvement, both in terms of environmental knowledge acquired and the intentions to adopt eco-friendly environmental behaviors.";2204521787;;;Scholarly Journals; Interdisciplinary Research Laboratory in Didactics of Science and Technology, LIRDIST, Faculty of Sciences Dhar Mahraz, Sidi Mohamed Ben Abdellah University, Fes, Morocco , Interdisciplinary Research Laboratory in Didactics of Science and Technology, LIRDIST, Faculty of Sciences Dhar Mahraz, Sidi Mohamed Ben Abdellah University, Fes, Morocco , Interdisciplinary Research Laboratory in Didactics of Science and Technology, LIRDIST, Faculty of Sciences Dhar Mahraz, Sidi Mohamed Ben Abdellah University, Fes, Morocco , Interdisciplinary Research Laboratory in Didactics of Science and Technology, LIRDIST, Faculty of Sciences Dhar Mahraz, Sidi Mohamed Ben Abdellah University, Fes, Morocco , Oum Lbanin High school, Fez Morocco;"El Batri, Bouchta;Alami, Anouar;Zaki, Moncef;Nafidi, Youssef;Chenfour, Driss";;;; © 2019.

Engineering assessment strata: A layered approach to evaluation spanning Bloom’s taxonomy of learning;Fostering metacognition can be challenging within large enrollment settings, particularly within STEM fields concentrating on problem-solving skills and their underlying theories. Herein, the research problem of realizing more frequent, insightful, and explicitly-rewarded metacognition activities at significant scale is investigated via a strategy utilizing a hierarchy of assessments. Referred to as the STEM-Optimal Digitized Assessment Strategy (SODAS) , this targeted approach engages frequent assessment, instructor feedback, and learner self-reflection across the hierarchy of learning mechanisms comprising Bloom’s Taxonomy of Learning Domains. SODAS spans this hierarchy of learning mechanisms via a progression of (i) unregulated online assessment, (ii) proctored Computer-Based Assessment (CBA), (iii) problem-based learning activities assessed in the laboratory setting, and (iv) personalized Socratic discussions of scanned scrap sheets that accompanied each learner’s machine-graded formative assessments. Results of a case study integrating SODAS within a high-enrollment Mechanical Engineering Heat Transfer course at a large state university are presented for enrollment of 118 students. Six question types were delivered with lockdown proctored testing via auto-grading within the Canvas Learning Management System (LMS), along with bi-weekly laboratory activities to address the higher layers of Bloom’s Taxonomy. Sample assessment formats were validated through student use and schedules of responsibilities for instructors across four tiers of assessment levels (facts, concepts, procedures, and metacognition), two testing delivery mechanisms (electronic textbook exercises and proctored CBA), and three remediation mechanisms (self-paced, score clarification, and experiment clarification), which showed that learning achievement can increase by up to 16.9% compared to conventional assessment strategies, while utilizing comparable instructor resources and workloads.;2115924269;;;Scholarly Journals; Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Central Florida, Orlando, FL, USA , Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering, University of Central Florida, Orlando, FL, USA , Pegasus Innovation Lab, University of Central Florida, Orlando, FL, USA;"DeMara, Ronald F;Tian, Tian;Howard, Wendy";;;; Education and Information Technologies is a copyright of Springer, (2018).

The effect of technology supported problem-based learning approach on adults’ self-efficacy perception for research-inquiry;In this study, the effect of technology supported problem-based learning activities on adults’ self-efficacy perception for research-inquiry was investigated. Furthermore, determining the advantages and limitations of using Facebook in adult education were also investigated. In the study in which a total of 25 adults continuing their graduate studies participated, a qualitative and quantitative mixed method was employed. Problem-based learning activities during the course of curriculum development were supported by Facebook, one of the social networks. Designed with a single group pre-test and post-test design, the study has reached the conclusion that the adults are pleased with the activities. The results from the research revealed that problem-based learning activities supported by Facebook did not significantly affect adults’ self-efficacy perceptions for research-inquiry avoidance and personal development, but that they provided a positive increase in perceptions of self-efficacy for sustaining research. The use of Facebook in adult education facilitates communication, information and resource sharing, access to resources, immediate feedback and correction, and effective use of time for learners. Moreover, Facebook provides an advantage for learners to cooperate with their peers and to participate actively in the learning process. However, besides its advantages, there are certain limitations of using Facebook in the educational environment. Learner’s distance to using technology, problems experienced with internet access or distractions from the Facebook news feed can be stated as the limitations of Facebook.;2115552760;;;Scholarly Journals; Near East University, Nicosia, Cyprus;Hursen, Cigdem;;" Facebook Inc

Professional development learning environments (PDLEs) embedded in a collaborative online learning environment (COLE): Moving towards a new conception of online professional learning;Teaching, and education in general, remain firmly rooted in the practices of the past and continue to resist the implementation of strategies and theories arising from educational research. Consequently, significant reforms have been slow to take hold in educational systems around the world. Much of the reluctance can be attributed to a widely-held misconception of the nature of learning. This project attempts to address this misconception through the development of Professional Development Learning Environments (PDLEs are a series of learning tasks and a video-based case study) embedded in an online learning environment that requires the collaboration of users to solve problems. To use a Problem-Based-Learning (PBL) approach in an online context requires a major paradigm shift as well as using tools that were not designed specifically for such a student-driven, process-centred pedagogical paradigm. This becomes a problem when online resources and systems are used for supporting in-service teacher in their pursuit of furthering their education. Although the current theories of learning and teaching may present the philosophical content of such courses, the online strategies used often conflict with the theory. To study the formal implementation of PBL as a social-constructivist pedagogical approach, into an online learning environment to provide the tools for e-learning that would be closer in design to the current thinking on the very nature of learning, the PDLEs were modified to become small reusable video clips with a structure designed to facilitate PBL and focus learners’ attention on higher order thinking skills rather than specifically on content. These modified PDLEs are referred to as Problem-Based Learning Objects (PBLOs). The PBLOs were embedded into a prototype of a Collaborative Online Learning Environment (COLE) which was developed simultaneously. The entire system was pilot tested with small groups. Preliminary results show that although many technical difficulties remain to be solved, using the environment does show evidence of some effect on beliefs about personal theories of learning, causing shifts from technical issues to those surrounding processes of learning. Our preliminary research has called attention to the potential ability of PBLO/COLE to disrupt conventional, transmission-based conceptions of online learning as content delivery. At the same time, however, our preliminary work has also indicated that learners who are not used to the collaborative opportunities provided within PBLO/COLE may still hold traditional orientations to teaching and learning as a “gold standard” to which all other options are compared. A purposeful direction for our future research will entail working with learners in PBLO/COLE over a sustained period so that they may engage in an online experience grounded in principles of socio-constructivism.;1999279842;;;Scholarly Journals; Faculty of Education, University of Ontario Institute of Technology, Oshawa, ON, Canada , Alexandria, ON, Canada , Faculty of Education, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK;"vanOostveen, Roland;Desjardins, François;Bullock, Shawn";;;; Education and Information Technologies is a copyright of Springer, (2018).

Exploring the implementation of CLIL-based Science lessons in the Greek School EFL context;Education, and more specifically foreign language teaching, has to adopt more innovative ways in the teaching process, renew itself and manage to be compatible with the modernized communities in our digital society. The Greek educational system needs a dynamic programme to activate both teachers and students in an attempt to get rid of the conventional and traditional way of teaching and learning. Varied opportunities of learning using innovative concepts of Content Language Integrated Learning (CLIL) and project-based learning are required. CLIL is virtually a tool for the promotion of foreign languages. The purpose of the research presented in this paper is to scrutinize the ways learners could improve their competences and skills during the process of creating a WebQuest project on the basis of applying adequately CLIL-based Science lessons with the aid of ICTs and examine their effectiveness in the Greek Primary School educational arena. Project is a method that leads towards this direction and modern technology provides learners with the opportunity to have access to overwhelming amounts of information. Experiential learning means that students are given the opportunity to use technology, to work in groups and develop intellectual and social skills. Students activate and develop learning strategies which enable them to carry out tasks successfully and become autonomous learners. The research for this study involved sixth grade primary school students.;2222887948;;;Scholarly Journals;;"Hasogia, Dimitra;Vlachos, Kosmas";;;; © 2019.

UCTS FOUNDATION STUDENTS' PERCEPTION TOWARDS ARDUINO AS A TEACHING AND LEARNING TOOL IN STEM EDUCATION;This paper presents the perception of University College of Technology Sarawak (UCTS) students on the implementation of the Arduino lessons incorporated in Foundation in Science (FIS) and Foundation in Arts (FIA) programmes as part of STEM education. The low number of students studying or applying for STEM fields has been alarming in regards to the nation's future workforce needs. Efforts have been made to attract more students to STEM programmes and careers. This study is intended to examine whether Arduino, as a teaching and learning tool, helps in generating students' interests towards STEM programmes. Arduino is one of the physical computing tools which has open-source electronics platform based on user-friendly hardware and software for creating different projects and applications. Arduino is easy to be used by beginners, yet flexible enough for advanced users to learn physical computing and programming. Results revealed that participating students felt that they learnt programming the most during Arduino learning process and Arduino is proven to cultivate their STEM interests and 21st century skills. In this paper, the students' awareness and experiences on learning Arduino in STEM education were studied. This study can be used to determine whether educational institutions should implement Arduino lessons to promote STEM interests among the students which further lead them to opt for STEM-related degree programmes and careers.;2396318689;;;Scholarly Journals;;"Ling, Ong Sing;Wah, Jill Ling Pei";;;; Copyright E-Bangi Journal 2019;; Journal Article;;; 2019;;1985-3505;; English; English;; 1-21; Bangi;2019;e-BANGI;;2019;;;16;https://search.proquest.com/docview/2396318689?accountid=11774;;;;;; 1;;; Laboratories , Teaching , Software , Students , Collaboration , Workforce , Communication , Interdisciplinary aspects , Mathematics education , Logic programming , STEM education , 21st century , Core curriculum , Research & development--R&D , Mechanical engineering , Social research , Robotics , Technology education , Learning , College students , Science education , Teaching , Sensors , Creativity , Critical thinking , Problem based learning , Technology , 21st century , Malaysia , Sarawak Malaysia;;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Asocscijournals&amp;atitle=UCTS+FOUNDATION+STUDENTS%27+PERCEPTION+TOWARDS+ARDUINO+AS+A+TEACHING+AND+LEARNING+TOOL+IN+STEM+EDUCATION&amp;title=e-BANGI&amp;issn=19853505&amp;date=2019-01-01&amp;volume=16&amp;issue=&amp;spage=1&amp;au=Ling%2C+Ong+Sing%3BWah%2C+Jill+Ling+Pei&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=e-BANGI&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/";ProQuest Central,Social Science Premium Collection
Project-based learning in capstone design courses for engineering students: Factors affecting learning outcomes;This study aimed to examine the structural relationships among factors that affect learner satisfaction and achievement in project-based learning for capstone design courses in engineering education. Specifically, problem-solving efficacy, task value, teamwork competency, and task authenticity are suggested as critical factors that affect learner satisfaction and perceived achievement. The study employed structural equation modelling in order to examine the relationships among the variables, and the data from 363 university students who were enrolled in capstone design courses were analysed. The results suggest that task value and task authenticity exerted significant effects on learner satisfaction. Problem-solving efficacy, teamwork competency, task authenticity, and satisfaction exerted significant effects on learning outcomes, but task value did not. The results imply that the effects of problem-solving efficacy on perceived achievement reveal the importance of motivational factors in capstone design courses. In addition, instructional strategies that highlight task utility value and provide environments in which learners can share that value would be meaningful in promoting learning effectiveness in capstone design courses.;2393070345;;;Scholarly Journals;;"Young Ju Joo;Lim, Kyu Yon;So Young Lee";;;; © 2019.

Peer assessment of teamwork in group projects: Evaluation of a rubric;Effective teamwork is integral to the functioning of many professions. Employers desire work-ready graduates who have developed the so-called 'soft skills' involved in teamwork. One way for students to practise and gain feedback on their team skills is through team-based assessment tasks. The TeamUP Rubric was developed to teach and assess five domains of teamwork skills through peer feedback. Initial evaluation of the five domains and use of the TeamUP with health and arts students has provided initial support for its utility as a measure of teamwork. In the current study the scale structure of each of the five domains was evaluated using Mokken scale analysis (MSA). MSA is a non-parametric item response theory approach that evaluates the internal structure of an evaluation tool. One-hundred and seventy-seven primary education students were recruited for the study. All participants were undertaking a teamwork assignment in a unit of study in their education degree at an Australian regional university. They completed the TeamUP Rubric assessment for themselves and for each of the students in their team. Each TeamUP domain met the requirements for a Mokken scale. The current study supports the validity of the scores derived from the TeamUP Rubric and further supports its use as a tool for teaching and assessing teamwork.;2391969610;;;Scholarly Journals;;"Vaughan, Brett;Yoxall, Jacqui;Grace, Sandra";;;; © 2019.

Professional Training of Border Guards in Ukraine: Challenges and Opportunities Related to Emerging Security Threats;Professional training of border guards is closely connected with Ukraine’s national development, its stability and economic prosperity. Due to emerging security threats, the training of future border guards in Ukraine has recently undergone radical changes including the reconsideration of professional competence. According to its reviewed profile, professional competence of border guards means integral unity of knowledge, skills, personal qualities, and values that help them perform their professional duties. Professional competence of border guards is the desired result of their training. The content of professional training for border guards is therefore an important aspect. Changes in the tasks facing the border agency has caused significant rethinking of training content for border guards, resulting in new subjects, sections, modules and topics. As information has to be transferred effectively to trainees, a range of teaching techniques was innovated in order to achieve the pedagogical intention. The innovative techniques include simulation technologies, horizontal learning, innovative lectures, training courses, information and communication technologies, interactive technologies, as well as game-based and project-based learning. These techniques are proven to be more effective in comparison to traditional methods. Despite some unresolved issues, the system of professional training for border guards in Ukraine has shown outstanding results. Further development and improvement will lead to the formation of professional competence of border guards at the desired high level.;2377711244;;;Scholarly Journals;;Bhinder, Nataliya V;;;; © 2019.

The Impact of an Arts Project-Based Language Program to Enhance EFL Learning;This study examines the impact of an arts project-based language program for Korean EFL college students, drawing upon the Stoller's PBL framework (2006). The investigation integrated an art project, based on a real-world task, into English language learning for college students of arts within a general English program. 15-week EFL course asked students to develop their portfolio or showcase reels with the goal of improving English language ability. The English-Based Art Communication course of 98 students was divided either into an experimental group (N = 49) or a control group (N = 49). The researchers administrated a pre- and post-questionnaire and a TOEIC speaking test to the students, with which to analyze the students' language improvement and change of perceptions on English learning. The researchers observed the whole process of students' doing their project and interviewed them regarding their learning experiences. Though there was no statistically significant improvement in the speaking skills in both groups, the questionnaire and interview data revealed a significant increase of positive perceptions among the experimental group about their major and the language learning, not to mention substantial improvements in vocabulary and overall confidence. The discoveries imply that the project-based language teaching become efficient with art-related works and students' engagement.;2345404669;;;Scholarly Journals;;"Park, Punahm;Eisenhower, Lee";;;; Copyright Asia TEFL Winter 2019; 10.18823/asiatefl.2019.16.4.11.1232; Journal Article;; 2019-12-31; Winter 2019;;1738-3102;4; English; English;; 1232-1250; Seoul;Winter 2019;Journal of Asia TEFL;;2019;;;16;https://search.proquest.com/docview/2345404669?accountid=11774;;;;;; 1232;;; College students , Art , Questionnaires , Second language learning , Foreign language instruction , English as a second language--ESL; project-based language learning , EFL Korean students , art project and portfolio , art communication;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aeducation&amp;atitle=The+Impact+of+an+Arts+Project-Based+Language+Program+to+Enhance+EFL+Learning&amp;title=Journal+of+Asia+TEFL&amp;issn=17383102&amp;date=2019-01-01&amp;volume=16&amp;issue=4&amp;spage=1232&amp;au=Park%2C+Punahm%3BEisenhower%2C+Lee&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=Journal+of+Asia+TEFL&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/10.18823%2Fasiatefl.2019.16.4.11.1232";ProQuest Central,Social Science Premium Collection
FROM COURSE PROJECT TO ENTREPRENEURSHIP: THE CASE OF ENGINEERING STUDENTS AT PRINCESS SUMAYA UNIVERSITY FOR TECHNOLOGY;"This research reviews the situation of entrepreneurship education in Jordan in general and at PSUT in particular focusing on engineering students. It also aims to assess the importance of entrepreneurship for these students, and how they can benefit from it in transforming their course projects into businesses, in addition to giving some recommendations for the university on how it can support entrepreneurship. The value of this paper relies not only on the scarcity of research in Jordan but also on its ability of being applied in other universities and other countries to support entrepreneurship education among engineering students all over the world. The paper described the situation of PSUT engineering students with regards to the course projects which they make and what actually happens to the resulting products. The research started with attending an exhibition for the engineering students in the embedded systems class where they presented their projects in the presence of some TV channels; the projects included interesting ideas of products which can be actually implemented and sold. A survey was distributed among students to assess their willingness to start their own businesses based on those products and to check their ability to do that, in addition to assessing their awareness of entrepreneurship in general. The survey was distributed during the exhibition under the supervision of the researchers in order to reduce the possibility of misunderstanding the questions. Some recommendations were given to the university based on the data analysis of this survey. Meanwhile, throughout this research interviews were conducted with Jordanian entrepreneurs to investigate the reasons of failure in the Jordanian market. Four years after applying the above mentioned recommendations another survey was distributed among students of the same major in order to assess the effect of implementing those recommendations.";2331772129;;;Scholarly Journals; Princess Sumaya University for Technology (PSUT) , Princess Sumaya University for Technology (PSUT);"Abualbasal, Abdelraheem M;Badran, Rand E";;;; Copyright Jordan Whitney Enterprises, Inc 2019;; Journal Article;;; 2019;;1098-8394;5; English; English;; 1-14; Arden;2019;Journal of Entrepreneurship Education;;2019;;;22;https://search.proquest.com/docview/2331772129?accountid=11774;;;;;; 1;;; Research , Problem solving , Computer engineering , Entrepreneurship education , Students , Embedded systems , Creativity , Teaching methods , Collaboration , Problem based learning , Teachers , Knowledge , Education , Entrepreneurship;;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aeducation&amp;atitle=FROM+COURSE+PROJECT+TO+ENTREPRENEURSHIP%3A+THE+CASE+OF+ENGINEERING+STUDENTS+AT+PRINCESS+SUMAYA+UNIVERSITY+FOR+TECHNOLOGY&amp;title=Journal+of+Entrepreneurship+Education&amp;issn=10988394&amp;date=2019-01-01&amp;volume=22&amp;issue=5&amp;spage=1&amp;au=Abualbasal%2C+Abdelraheem+M%3BBadran%2C+Rand+E&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=Journal+of+Entrepreneurship+Education&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/";ProQuest Central,Social Science Premium Collection
A Pilot Study on Developing Newsgames in Collaboration between Journalism and Computer Science Students;Producing digital and interactive journalistic products offers unique and important new learning opportunities for journalism education. This study analysed the experiences of two pilot courses on so-called ‘newsgames’ in a Finnish university in 2015 and 2017. The data consisted of the newsgames and other materials produced by the students, student feedback concerning the course and observations of teachers throughout the project. Our analysis demonstrates how producing newsgames in the context of higher education may foster project-based learning experiences, something that has been relatively rare in traditional journalism education. Collaboration with media companies also offered valuable feedback for the students throughout the course and provided them with an opportunity to practice selling their expertise. The study highlights how interdisciplinary and project-based cooperation may benefit journalism education.;2319729390;;;Scholarly Journals;;"Siitonen, Marko;Uotila, Panu;Uskali, Turo;Varsaluoma, Jukka;Välisalo, Tanja";;;; © 2019.

Examining changes in medical students’ emotion regulation in an online PBL session;"Given recent attention to emotion regulation (ER) as an important factor in personal well-being and effective social communication, there is a need for detection mechanisms that accurately capture ER and facilitate adaptive responding (Calvo &amp; D’Mello, 2010). Current approaches to determining ER are mainly limited to self-report data such as questionnaires, inventories and interviews (e.g., Davis, Griffith, Thiel, &amp; Connelly, 2015). Although beneficial, these self-report approaches have important shortcomings such as social desirability biases, recall issues, and inability to capture unconscious ER (Scherer, 2005). The research presented here explores this gap by examining the use of multimodal observational data as well as self-report data to more accurately capture ER. Specifically, this study develops and employs a multimodal analysis of emotion data channels (facial, vocal and postural emotion data channels) to provide a rich analysis of ER in an international case study of four medical students interacting in an emotionally challenging learning session (i.e., communicating bad news to patients) in a technology-rich learning environment. The findings reported in the paper can provide insights for educators in designing programs to enhance and evaluate ER strategies of students in order to regulate personal emotions as well as the emotional needs of others in stressful situations. This work also makes important contributions to the design of technology-rich environments to embed dynamic ER detection mechanisms that enable systems to gain a more holistic view of the participants, and to adapt instructions based on their affective needs. https//doi.org/10.34105/j.kmel.2019.11.008";2287033427;;;Scholarly Journals;;"Kazemitabar, Maedeh;Lajoie, Susanne P;Doleck, Tenzin";;;; © 2019.

Using Hybrid Problem-based Learning (HPBL) Approach to Enhance Libyan EFL Students’ Engagement with English Language;This article explores how the Hybrid Problem-Based Learning (HPBL) approach can improve the Libyan EFL learners’ performance in English language speaking. The paper employed the case study research design in which qualitative data through observation and interview were collected and analysed thematically. The participants involved in the study were 30 first-year undergraduate students in one of the Libyan public universities. The study was conducted in the period of 9 weeks. The course was conducted alternatingly between traditional and PBL lessons. The PBL lessons were based on 7 steps of Schmidt, Dauphinee and Patel (1989). At the end of each PBL lesson, students presented their possible solutions for the problem presented in a form of oral presentation (OP). It was found that after undergoing the HPBL process, the speaking ability of the learners improved in fluency, grammar, comprehension, vocabulary, confidence level, intonation skills and pronunciation. It is, thus, concluded the HPBL approach is a worthwhile alternative for English lecturers for the transformation of the stagnant approach to the teaching of English language in the Libyan EFL context.;2249637328;;;Scholarly Journals;;"Baresh, Eman Fathi;Suraini Mohd Ali;Darmi, Ramiaida";;;; © 2019.

Knowledge Encoding in Game Mechanics: Transfer-Oriented Knowledge Learning in Desktop-3D and VR;Affine Transformations (ATs) are a complex and abstract learning content. Encoding the AT knowledge in Game Mechanics (GMs) achieves a repetitive knowledge application and audiovisual demonstration. Playing a serious game providing these GMs leads to motivating and effective knowledge learning. Using immersive Virtual Reality (VR) has the potential to even further increase the serious game’s learning outcome and learning quality. This paper compares the effectiveness and efficiency of desktop-3D and VR in respect to the achieved learning outcome. Also, the present study analyzes the effectiveness of an enhanced audiovisual knowledge encoding and the provision of a debriefing system. The results validate the effectiveness of the knowledge encoding in GMs to achieve knowledge learning.

The Effects of 3D Multi-User Virtual Environments on Collaborative Learning and Social Presence;Three-dimensional Multi-User Virtual Environments (MUVEs) are being increasingly used in many areas, and they are becoming more and more integrated with learning and teaching. MUVEs can be used in learning and teaching to facilitate student learning and collaboration. This study identified the effects of MUVEs on collaborative learning and social presence and investigated whether these effects varied by gender. The participants were sophomore students attending a programming language course. They used a MUVE for their group meetings as part of their collaborative work. They also held voice communication. A four-section questionnaire was administered to the students who attended the meetings, in which the researchers served as facilitators. Interviews were held with randomly selected students. In addition, the group project meetings were tape-recorded, and field notes were taken for each meeting. The results showed that the MUVE enabled the group members to exchange ideas in an authentic environment, and that the file-sharing platform used as a complement to the MUVE reinforced collaborative learning. As long as technical problems are prevented, effective collaborative learning can be achieved in these environments.;2204521347;;;Scholarly Journals; Hacettepe University, Department of Computer Education and Instructional Technology, Ankara, Turkey , Ministry of National Education, Sarıidris Secondary School, Isparta, Turkey , Ondokuz Mayıs University, Department of Computer Education and Instructional Technology, Samsun, Turkey;"Tüzün, Hakan;Bilgiç, Hatice Gökçe;Elçi, Sevil Yaşar";;;; © 2019.

Wiki-based Collaborative Writing: A Comparative Study on First and Second Language Writing among Chinese Secondary Students;This study aims to examine how learners engaged in wiki-based collaborative writing when they were using their first language (L1) or second language (L2). Issues concerning similarities and differences in wiki collaborative writing activities, wiki participation levels, wiki interaction patterns and wiki collaboration levels between the L1 and L2 writing groups are discussed. This paper reports a case study of a group of Hong Kong secondary school students who were required to use “Google Sites” to complete their Liberal Studies group projects. Student’s wiki writings and comments in their L1 (Chinese) and L2 (English) were collected and examined. Results indicated that, while similarities in writing activity patterns, participation levels and collaboration levels were shown in the two groups, differences did exist in their interaction patterns, which were affected by the different ways they used the wiki comment sections. This study can help educators to become aware of the different needs of L1 and L2 groups and to implement wiki collaborative writing more effectively to support students.;2193195419;;;Scholarly Journals;;"Chu, Samuel K W;Wu, Jing;Kwan, Crystal W S;Lai, Jean H Y";;;; © 2019.

Will personalized e-Learning increase deep learning in higher education?;Purpose Recent research in higher education has pointed out that personalized e-learning through the use of learning management systems, such as Moodle, improves the academic results of students and facilitates the detection of at-risk students. Design/methodology/approach A sample of 124 students following the Degree in Health Sciences at the University of Burgos participated in this study. The objectives were as follows: to verify whether the use of a Moodle-based personalized e-learning system will predict the learning outcomes of students and the use of effective learning behaviour patterns and to study whether it will increase student satisfaction with teaching practice. Findings The use of a Moodle-based personalized e-learning system that included problem-based learning (PBL) methodology predicted the learning outcomes by 42.3 per cent, especially with regard to the results of the quizzes. In addition, it predicted effective behavioural patterns by 74.2 per cent. Increased student satisfaction levels were also identified through the conceptual feedback provided by the teacher, arguably because it facilitated a deeper understanding of the subject matter. Research limitations/implications The results of this work should be treated with caution, because of the sample size and the specificity of the branch of knowledge of the students, as well as the design type. Future studies will be directed at increasing the size of the sample and the diversity of the qualifications. Originality/value Learning methodology in the twenty-first century has to be guided towards carefully structured work from the pedagogic point of view in the learning management systems allowing for process-oriented feedback and PBL both included in personalized e-learning systems.;2184564333;;;Scholarly Journals; Universidad de Burgos Facultad de Ciencias de la Salud, Burgos, Spain , Universidad de Burgos Escuela Politecnica Superior, Burgos, Spain , Universidad de Burgos Escuela Politecnica Superior, Burgos, Spain , Universidad de Valladolid, Facultad de Educación y Trabajo Social Valladolid, Spain;"María Consuelo Sáiz-Manzanares;García Osorio, César Ignacio;Díez-Pastor, José Francisco;Martín Antón, Luis Jorge";;;; © Emerald Publishing Limited 2019; 10.1108/IDD-08-2018-0039; Journal Article;;; 2019;;2398-6247;1; English; English;; 53-63; Bingley;2019;Information Discovery and Delivery;;2019;;;47;https://search.proquest.com/docview/2184564333?accountid=11774;;;;; 2018-08-29 (Received) , 2018-11-09 (Revised) , 2018-12-05 (Revised) , 2018-12-06 (Accepted); 53;;; Teaching , Online instruction , Higher education , Access to information , Blended learning , Learning management systems , Metacognition , Data mining , Feedback , Deep learning; Moodle , Learning , Personalized , Blended , Log files analysis , Self-regulated;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aabiglobal&amp;atitle=Will+personalized+e-Learning+increase+deep+learning+in+higher+education%3F&amp;title=Information+Discovery+and+Delivery&amp;issn=23986247&amp;date=2019-01-01&amp;volume=47&amp;issue=1&amp;spage=53&amp;au=Mar%C3%ADa+Consuelo+S%C3%A1iz-Manzanares%3BGarc%C3%ADa+Osorio%2C+C%C3%A9sar+Ignacio%3BD%C3%ADez-Pastor%2C+Jos%C3%A9+Francisco%3BMart%C3%ADn+Ant%C3%B3n%2C+Luis+Jorge&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=Information+Discovery+and+Delivery&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/10.1108%2FIDD-08-2018-0039";ProQuest Central,Social Science Premium Collection
Technology in problem-based learning: helpful or hindrance?;Purpose The purpose of this paper is to examine the relationship between student motivation and technology in the implementation of problem-based learning (PBL) in a technologically enhanced active learning classroom (ALC). Design/methodology/approach PBL was implemented in an undergraduate course in human osteology ( n =49) at a large Canadian University. Numerous activities using the ALC technology were conducted to engage students in self-directed active learning. Students wrote critical self-reflections at the beginning of the course and with each PBL report. They completed a survey at the end of the course using a Likert scale that included written comments on their motivation toward different uses of technology. Findings Students generally had high motivation toward PBL at the end of the course. Their evaluation of the technology to support PBL was dependent on the activity. Students (88 percent) appreciated the use of an overhead camera to visualize anatomical elements, and short problem-solving exercises using the whiteboard but they negatively evaluated the real-time projection of PBL sessions through a discussion board (52 percent). Almost half of the class (43 percent) felt that technology was a hindrance to their learning process in PBL. Originality/value This study demonstrates the complex relationship between student motivation toward active learning, the learning environment, and technology. Instructors and students influence the learning environment through their conceptions of effective teaching. According to this framework, technology should be implemented not only according to the teaching method, but consider teaching conceptions and the learning environment.;2182405042;;;Scholarly Journals; Department of Anthropology, University of Toronto – Mississauga, Mississauga, Canada , Department of Anthropology, University of Toronto – Mississauga, Mississauga, Canada;"Fukuzawa, Sherry;Cahn, Joel";;;; © Emerald Publishing Limited 2019; 10.1108/IJILT-12-2017-0123; Journal Article , Case Study;;; 2019;;2056-4880;1; English; English;; 66-76; Bingley;2019;The International Journal of Information and Learning Technology;;2019;;;36;https://search.proquest.com/docview/2182405042?accountid=11774;;;;; 2017-12-29 (Received) , 2018-05-25 (Revised) , 2019-01-30 (Accepted); 66;;; Problem solving , Motivation , Classrooms , Active learning , Collaboration , Teaching methods , Technology assessment , Learning , Communication , Biomedical materials , School environment , Student participation , Design , Educational technology , Biocompatibility , Critical thinking , Problem based learning , Independent study , Problem solving , Students , Colleges & universities , Teachers , Canada; Active learning , Problem-based learning , Active learning classroom , Technology;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aabiglobal&amp;atitle=Technology+in+problem-based+learning%3A+helpful+or+hindrance%3F&amp;title=The+International+Journal+of+Information+and+Learning+Technology&amp;issn=20564880&amp;date=2019-01-01&amp;volume=36&amp;issue=1&amp;spage=66&amp;au=Fukuzawa%2C+Sherry%3BCahn%2C+Joel&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=The+International+Journal+of+Information+and+Learning+Technology&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/10.1108%2FIJILT-12-2017-0123";ProQuest Central,SciTech Premium Collection,Social Science Premium Collection
SPSE — a model of engineering multimedia learning and training;Engineering learning has long been a topic of attention. The traditional engineering learning mode has its own rationality, which is not without merit. The PBL (Problem-Based Learning) model provides new ideas of engineering learning, yet it lacks the “design” elements, seldom takes into consideration the social attribute of engineering, and falls short of clear support to guide learners in problem-solving. This paper analyzes the properties and characteristics of various types of engineering learning modes, based on which the engineering learning is divided into 4 key nodes. Besides, it proposes a design-based scaffold-type engineering learning model — SPSE (Scenario Prototype Scheme Evaluating), and explains SPSE from dimensions of engineering process, design and innovation. In order to improve the efficiency of SPSE engineering learning and training, a management platform software based on WEB and multimedia technology is designed. On the one hand, this software supports the communication and discussion between students and teachers. On the other hand, it supports the teacher to the student learning process monitoring and management. Finally, a successful case of SPSE teaching practice is used to further verify the rationality and effectiveness of engineering learning based on SPSE. Finally, a successful case of SPSE teaching practice is used to further verify the rationality and effectiveness of engineering learning based on SPSE.;2090926096;;;Scholarly Journals; Ningbo Institute of Technology, Zhejiang University, Ningbo, China , Ningbo Institute of Technology, Zhejiang University, Ningbo, China , Ningbo Institute of Technology, Zhejiang University, Ningbo, China;"Wang, Chengbo;Xiao, Hui;Wen, Shiting";;;; Multimedia Tools and Applications is a copyright of Springer, (2018).

Supervision of Undergraduate Final Year Projects in Computing: A Case Study;Final Year Projects (FYPs) play a significant role in undergraduate education in the computing field of study, and most of the related university departments and schools consider them an essential contribution to this study. However, issues such as whether to assign the projects individually or to a group of students, the procedures followed in their assignment, the supervision process and the evaluation of the outcomes have been of concern to many academics in the field. In this case study, we present the methods for activities such as assignment, supervision, and evaluation of FYPs at the University of Kurdistan Hewlêr (UKH) between the years 2009 and 2017. We discuss the development of our approach and the lessons learned during the mentioned period. Furthermore, we present our current way of managing the FYP module. The aim is to develop a platform for interested and involved academics to discuss the topic further. Sharing the experiences on managing FYPs would not only help in making the module more attractive and beneficial to the students but also in the consolidation of the guidelines and indicators of the proper supervision and a fair evaluation of this significant undergraduate study endeavor.;2309539546;;;Scholarly Journals;;"Hassani, Hossein;Kadir, Govand;Al-Salihi, Nawzad K;Wrya Muhammad Ali Monnet;Ali-Yahiya, Tara;Fattah Alizade";;" IEEE Computer Society

Enhancing Entrepreneurship Education in a Master’s Degree in Computer Engineering: A Project-Based Learning Approach;New master’s degrees in computer engineering, designed according to Spanish government requirements, include both technical and business subjects to provide advanced knowledge compared to undergraduate studies. In spite of acquiring this advanced knowledge, our students are not always aware of the significant added value and the positive elements the master’s degree provides for their future professional careers. Moreover, we have observed that students regard the different subjects as isolated blocks of knowledge. To tackle these problems, we have carried out a learning experience based on the creation of a technology-based enterprise (TBE) through the development of a common project (CP). Drawing on project-based learning (PBL) methodology, the CP consists of the identification, development, and final oral presentation of a business model. It aims to utilize sensor data and analysis in different domains. The experience has been highly positive, reducing the gap between studies and business practice, and increasing coordination among teachers. A key issue is that all the subjects of the master’s degree are involved in this learning experience. In addition, results show a high level of satisfaction with the master’s degree, compared to other similar courses.;2247708274;;;Scholarly Journals;;"Arias, Enrique;Barba-Sánchez, Virginia;Carrión, Carmen;Casado, Rafael";;" European Commission

Motivating Language Learners during Times of Crisis through Project-based Learning: Filming Activities at the Arab International University (AIU);Times of crisis and the critical conditions that Syrian students have experienced during the last six years have a significant influence on their level of motivation, their academic performance and their attitudes towards their study in general and language learning in specific. This study explores the effects of project-based learning through video making on students' motivation and attitudes towards English courses in comparison to the negative effects produced by the traditional teaching which is mainly based on textbooks. This research is carried out at Arab international university, Foreign Language Center. A total of 24 intermediate students from three different majors participated in the study. Data were drawn from a number of resources including group discussions and informal notes, student self-evaluation questionnaire, and students' performance results. The learning outcomes were remarkable. The motivational level and the attitudes of the experimental group in the second part of the course in which project-based learning sessions were held improved and witnessed a difference in performance comparing it to the first eight weeks of the course in which traditional teaching approach was implemented. Moreover, the learners have improved their linguistic skills when attempting to write the video scripts in addition to developing their oral presentation skills, team work, and their organization and planning skills.;2157298630;;;Scholarly Journals; English Department, Arab International University, Damascus, Syria;Assaf, Dareen;;" Arab International University

Identifying the mathematics middle year students use as they address a community issue;Middle year students often do not see the mathematics in the real world whereas the Australian Curriculum: Mathematics aims for students to be “confident and creative users and communicators of mathematics” (Australian Curriculum Assessment and Reporting Authority [ACARA] 2012). Using authentic and real mathematics tasks can address this situation. This paper is an account of how, working within a Knowledge Producing Schools’ framework, a group of middle year students addressed a real community issue, the problem of the lack of a teenage safe space using mathematics and technology. Data were collected for this case study via journal observations and reflections, semi-structured interviews, samples of the students’ work and videos of students working.

Investigating Flipped Classroom and Problem-based Learning in a Programming Module for Computing Conversion Course;This research paper investigates the effectiveness of combined Flipped Classroom (FC) and Problem-based Learning (PBL) teaching approach in a computer programming module. Combined FC-PBL makes use of learning technologies and supports authentic learning in terms of authentic context, multiple perspectives through team work and collaboration. FC involves watching educational videos prior to class session, and using the class session for practical tasks, thus supporting programming skills development. PBL enables authentic learning activities through group work and helps students to develop 21st century skills such as self-direction, collaboration, creativity and innovation. A research case study was conducted that considered a three-stage based delivery of the module that involved traditional, only FC, and combined FC-PBL teaching approaches applied on a number of programming topics. Both the educational and edutainment benefits were analyzed. The results show that combined FC-PBL approach is effective and the knowledge acquired by students improves, in particular, for the weaker students. Only 1.9% of students have scored an assessment mark lower than 40% compared to 28.3% and 24.5% when the traditional teaching and FC-only approaches respectively were used. Overall, a 26.56% increase in the assessment results was noticed when combined FC-PBL was used. The edutainment element was investigated through a questionnaire that assessed learning environment, engagement, learner satisfaction and whether the students have enjoyed learning sessions. The survey analysis shows that the combined FC-PBL approach does aid in the edutainment of mature students and provides an enjoyable learning experience.;2147868967;;;Scholarly Journals;;"Chis, Adriana E;Moldovan, Arghir-Nicolae;Murphy, Lisa;Pathak, Pramod;Cristina Hava Muntean";;;; © 2018.

Personality and Learning Effectiveness of Teams in Information Systems Education Courses;The goal of this paper is to clarify the optimal combination of team members to maximize the learning effectiveness in information systems education courses. We surveyed the correlation of students’ five factor model personalities and the learning effectiveness, which is the amount of increase in team management or technical knowledge, and skill, which is the IPA common carrier skill framework based on SFIA. Specifically, we targeted were three actual courses (a System Development Project course, an IT Management Project course, and an Application Development Project course) to elucidate the relationships between personality characteristics and learning effectiveness. Although individual students’ personality characteristics are not strongly related to learning effectiveness, team personality characteristics are related to learning effectiveness. In particular, Neuroticism and Conscientiousness characteristics are negatively correlated to learning effectiveness.;2306230440;;;Scholarly Journals;;"Shuto, Masashi;Washizaki, Hironori;Fukazawa, Yoshiaki;Yamato, Shoso;Okubo, Masashi;Tenbergen, Bastian";;;; © 2018.

Pakistani undergraduate students’ perceptions of project-based learning in the English composition course;Purpose The purpose of this paper is to explore how BS first-year students of the computer science department at a private university in Karachi perceive project-based learning (PjBL) implemented in the English composition course. The more specific objectives were to bring to light the benefits and challenges associated with PjBL from the students’ standpoint. Research works on students’ perceptions of project-based learning particularly in English language teaching remains an underresearched area in Pakistan and this makes this study useful and essential. Design/methodology/approach Adopting the lens of constructionism, this study used the qualitative approach for investigation. Thus, to achieve an in-depth insight into students’ perceptions, they were provided an opportunity to reflect and freely report their views regarding the project approach. The participants in this study formulate perceptions about a given phenomenon based on a thoughtful analysis of their experiences with that phenomenon. The qualitative researcher aims to get a deep understanding of these views of the participants, and so this study employed accounts and drawings as data collection tools. The data were then content analyzed. Findings Upon data analysis, two major themes emerged being the benefits and challenges associated with PjBL. The benefits can be further divided into academic and non-academic benefits. The major academic benefit was that the project approach allowed students to achieve a deeper and more meaningful understanding of the subject matter whereas the non-academic benefits include enhanced communication and negotiation skills, time management, creative and critical thinking skills. The major challenges faced by the students were related to time management and getting along with each other in groups. Originality/value The research problem is a scarcely explored area in Pakistani English language teaching in higher education. Moreover, the use of student drawings as a data collection method is an unusual method for this research problem.;2213347057;;;Scholarly Journals; FAST-National University of Computer and Emerging Sciences, Islamabad, Pakistan , Iqra University, Karachi, Pakistan;"Sultan, Sameera;Javaid, Syeda Tuba";;;; © Emerald Publishing Limited 2018; 10.1108/JARHE-11-2017-0135; Journal Article;;; 2018;;2050-7003;3; English; English;; 217-229; Bingley;2018;Journal of Applied Research in Higher Education;;2018;;;10;https://search.proquest.com/docview/2213347057?accountid=11774;;;;; 2017-11-06 (Received) , 2018-01-03 (Revised) , 2018-01-04 (Accepted); 217;;; Students , Collaboration , Teaching methods , Perceptions , Learning , Pakistan , Karachi Pakistan; Project-based learning , Cooperation , Perceptions , Collaborative learning , Experiential learning;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aeducation&amp;atitle=Pakistani+undergraduate+students%26rsquo%3B+perceptions+of+project-based+learning+in+the+English+composition+course&amp;title=Journal+of+Applied+Research+in+Higher+Education&amp;issn=20507003&amp;date=2018-07-01&amp;volume=10&amp;issue=3&amp;spage=217&amp;au=Sultan%2C+Sameera%3BJavaid%2C+Syeda+Tuba&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=Journal+of+Applied+Research+in+Higher+Education&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/10.1108%2FJARHE-11-2017-0135";ProQuest Central,Social Science Premium Collection

The hard work of soft skills: augmenting the project-based learning experience with interdisciplinary teamwork;This two-year qualitative study explored the learning process alongside students’ perceived outcomes within an interdisciplinary project-based learning (PjBL) task. Students from three different undergraduate courses were assigned a project that spanned across all three classes and placed student teams in the roles of client and contractor. Content analysis of reflective journals and focus groups provided a rich view of the learning experience from the student perspective. Findings from Year 1 demonstrated ways in which students had employed soft skills (e.g., communication, collaboration), but also revealed the need for changes to the course design to fully realize the interdisciplinary vision of the project. Findings from Year 2 showed how students negotiated the realistic tensions of the client-contractor relationship while working to develop both soft skills and hard skills (e.g., programming, design, market research). Overall, this study reveals how the interdisciplinary nature of this project supported important aspects of student learning that might not have occurred through a more traditional class project. In addition, it sheds light on the importance of interdisciplinary collaboration among instructors when designing a PjBL experience that pushes students to crosses disciplinary boundaries.;1969425661;;;Scholarly Journals; Oklahoma State University, Stillwater, OK, USA , Oklahoma State University, Stillwater, OK, USA , Oklahoma State University, Stillwater, OK, USA , Oklahoma State University, Stillwater, OK, USA , Virginia Tech, Blacksburg, VA, USA , Oklahoma State University, Stillwater, OK, USA;"Vogler, Jane S;Thompson, Penny;Davis, David W;Mayfield, Blayne E;Finley, Patrick M;Dar Yasseri";;;; Instructional Science is a copyright of Springer, (2017).

The Effect of Project-based Cooperative Studio Studies on the Basic Electronics Skills of Students’ Cooperative Learning and their Attitudes;Engineering education plays a prominent role in the development of technologies, society, nation, production, economy and employment. It is the art of applying scientific and mathematical principles, and experience to produce a technical product or system to meet out a specific need in the society. Based on the literature, it was thought that implementation of a cooperative project-based education on electrical-electronics engineering students could contribute to their basic engineering skills, their cooperative learning, and their attitudes towards engineering education and occupation. The aim of this study was to reveal the effect of project-based cooperative studio studies on the occupational basic skills of electrical-electronics engineering students, cooperative learning, and their attitudes towards engineering occupation. The research is designed to be a study that is half-experimental and half-quantitative study and was composed of 42 students. Within the research, project-based cooperative studio studies were utilized by the experimental group while the control group had similar course requirements for six weeks, but their practice solely included the content of the Lab II course in the official curriculum. The resulting data was gathered using the Basic Electronics Skills Self-Effacement Scale, the Scale for Attitude towards Cooperative Learning, and the Scale for Attitude towards Engineering and Engineering Education. The results indicate that the project-based cooperative studio studies are contributing more meaningfully to students’ intermediate level electronics skills, and their attitudes towards cooperative learning and towards engineering occupation.;2073358092;;;Scholarly Journals;;KORKMAZ, Özgen;;;; © 2018.

Fostering Cooperative Learning with Scrum in a Semi-Capstone Systems Analysis and Design Course;Agile methods such as Scrum that emphasize technical, communication, and teamwork skills have been practiced by IT professionals to effectively deliver software products of good quality. The same methods combined with pedagogies of engagement can potentially be used in the setting of higher education to promote effective group learning in software development classrooms. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to integrate both Scrum and cooperative learning guidelines into a systems analysis and design classroom to promote the skills of teamwork, communication, and problem-solving while learning systems analysis and design methods. This integration was implemented in a sophomore, semi-capstone design course where students were engaged in collaborative classroom activities. Two different approaches - overlapped approach and delayed approach - were used in two different semesters for this implementation. Based on the analysis of student performance in the course, student reflections on their team performance, and student overall perceptions of the teaching approach, this study suggests that the integration of cooperative learning and Scrum serves as guidance for students to effectively analyze and design software solutions, as well as to reflect on their team performance and learning process. In addition, a delayed approach for Scrum implementation appears to effectively support student learning by providing better and earlier feedback.;2056814093;;;Scholarly Journals;;"Magana, Alejandra J;Seah, Ying Ying;Thomas, Paul";;;; Copyright EDSIG Spring 2018;; Journal Article;;; Spring 2018;;1055-3096;2; English; English;; 75-91; West Lafayette;Spring 2018;Journal of Information Systems Education;;2018;;;29;https://search.proquest.com/docview/2056814093?accountid=11774;;;;;; 75;;; Information systems , Skills , Systems analysis , Teamwork , Educational technology , Problem solving , Students , Cooperative learning , Design analysis , Software quality , Systems analysis , Project management , Learning , Product development , Classrooms , Design engineering , Information technology , Software engineering , Teamwork , Seminars;;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aabiglobal&amp;atitle=Fostering+Cooperative+Learning+with+Scrum+in+a+Semi-Capstone+Systems+Analysis+and+Design+Course&amp;title=Journal+of+Information+Systems+Education&amp;issn=10553096&amp;date=2018-04-01&amp;volume=29&amp;issue=2&amp;spage=75&amp;au=Magana%2C+Alejandra+J%3BSeah%2C+Ying+Ying%3BThomas%2C+Paul&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=Journal+of+Information+Systems+Education&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/";ProQuest Central,SciTech Premium Collection,Social Science Premium Collection
Coping with Uncertainty in an Agile Systems Development Course;Uncertain and ambiguous environments are commonplace in information systems development (ISD) projects, and while different Agile frameworks welcome changes in organizational, technical, and business environments, the incurred uncertainty is known to negatively affect the development process and the quality of the final product. The effects of uncertainty on ISD projects have been studied in the past in real organizational contexts, but the effects of uncertainty on students in Agile systems development have received less attention from scholars. In this study, we measured the effects of experienced uncertainty on students' performance in an Agile systems development course and how uncertainty affected the quality of the system developed by the students using Scrum. We implemented the course using a problem based learning (PBL) approach and simulated uncertainty through various work environment reflecting concepts. Our study reveals that the effects of uncertainty are fairly similar among students and software professionals, and we identified three different coping strategies that students used with varying degrees of success. We present that learning approaches such as PBL enable a befitting environment for students to acquire hands-on experience in coping with uncertain environments, thus mitigating the problems students are likely to face in their work environments.;2056813906;;;Scholarly Journals;;"Taipalus, Toni;Seppänen, Ville;Pirhonen, Maritta";;;; Copyright EDSIG Spring 2018;; Journal Article;;; Spring 2018;;1055-3096;2; English; English;; 117-126; West Lafayette;Spring 2018;Journal of Information Systems Education;;2018;;;29;https://search.proquest.com/docview/2056813906?accountid=11774;;;;;; 117;;; Teaching , Information systems , Research methodology , Working conditions , Project management , Problem based learning , Systems development , Problem based learning , Uncertainty , Students , Uncertainty , Seminars , Work environment;;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aabiglobal&amp;atitle=Coping+with+Uncertainty+in+an+Agile+Systems+Development+Course&amp;title=Journal+of+Information+Systems+Education&amp;issn=10553096&amp;date=2018-04-01&amp;volume=29&amp;issue=2&amp;spage=117&amp;au=Taipalus%2C+Toni%3BSepp%C3%A4nen%2C+Ville%3BPirhonen%2C+Maritta&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=Journal+of+Information+Systems+Education&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/";ProQuest Central,SciTech Premium Collection,Social Science Premium Collection
Snowman: Agile development method with institutionalized communication and documentation for capstone projects;Numerous organizations currently implement agile methods in practical software development processes. Using agile methods involves mutually strengthening communication to ease the burden involved in documenting plan-driven projects. A focus on people-oriented communication has resulted in agile methods being diverted from development processes that codify formal documents. This situation makes follow-up software maintenance difficult. This paper proposes an appropriate and concrete approach for streamlining communication and documentation in software engineering education called the Snowman approach.

Robotics and STEM learning: students’ achievements in assignments according to the P3 Task Taxonomy—practice, problem solving, and projects;"This study presents the case of development and evaluation of a STEM-oriented 30-h robotics course for junior high school students (n&#xa0;=&#xa0;32). Class activities were designed according to the P3 Task Taxonomy, which included: (1) practice—basic closed-ended tasks and exercises; (2) problem solving—small-scale open-ended assignments in which the learner can choose the solution method or arrive at different answers; and (3) project-based learning—open-ended challenging tasks. The research aimed at exploring students’ working patterns, achievements in learning the course, and the impact of this experience on students’ motivation to learn STEM subjects. Evaluation tools included a final exam on factual, procedural and conceptual knowledge in the STEM subject learned in the course, class observations, interviews with the students, and administrating an attitude questionnaire before and after the course. Since the experimental class was quite heterogenic in regard to students’ prior learning achievements and motivation to learn, some of the students completed just the basic exercises, others coped well with the problem-solving tasks, and only a few took it upon themselves to carry out a complex project. However, all students showed high motivation to learn robotics and STEM subjects. In summary, robotics provides a very rich and attractive learning environment for STEM education. Yet, the realization of this potential depends largely on careful design of the course methodology and especially the students’ assignments in the class. One should recognize that often only some students are capable of learning a new subject on their own through project work, and these students also need to gain additional knowledge and skills before dealing with complex projects.";2002610977;;;Scholarly Journals; Department of Science and Technology Education, Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, Beer Sheva, Israel , Department of Science and Technology Education, Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, Beer Sheva, Israel;"Barak, Moshe;Assal, Muhammad";;;; International Journal of Technology and Design Education is a copyright of Springer, (2016).

Roadmapping towards sustainability proficiency in engineering education;Purpose The purpose of this paper is to deliver a roadmap that displays pathways to develop sustainability skills in the engineering curricula. Design/methodology/approach The selected approach to enrich engineering students with sustainability skills was active learning methodologies. First, a survey was carried out on a sample of 189 students to test the current sustainability literacy and determine the roadmap starting point. Next, a scientometric study regarding active learning methodologies was executed. A total of 2,885 articles and conference proceedings from the period 2013-2016 were retrieved from the Web of Science database. The records were then imported into text mining software to undergo a term clumping process. Annual knowledge clusters based on key terms were outputted. Finally, a roadmap was created by experts based on the annual knowledge clusters. Findings Four annual pathways were created along the roadmap to develop sustainability skills during the four-year college course in engineering. The first consisted on promoting a recycling campaign through a circular economy. The second aimed at creating educational videos regarding sustainability. The third reinforced reasoning and argumentative skills by preparing a debate on environmental issues. The last path assumed that the student is working in internship programs and prepared him/her to apply environmental management models to solve sustainability issues within the company. Research limitations/implications Roadmaps should be updated approximately every two years to reflect novelty. The proposed methodology shows an easy way to create them. Practical implications Results from this paper, as well as the proposed methodology, can be applied to any organization forming individuals: from primary school education to employee training programs in organizations. Social implications The development of sustainability skills has a direct, positive impact on professional decision-making and, ultimately, on the environment. Originality/value This paper presents a roadmapping process to develop sustainability competences throughout engineering college education.;1988486536;;;Scholarly Journals;;"Rodriguez-Andara, Alejandro;Río-Belver, Rosa María;Rodríguez-Salvador, Marisela;Lezama-Nicolás, René";;;; © Emerald Publishing Limited 2018; 10.1108/IJSHE-06-2017-0079; Journal Article;;; 2018;;1467-6370;2; English; English;; 413-438; Bradford;2018;International Journal of Sustainability in Higher Education;;2018;;;19;https://search.proquest.com/docview/1988486536?accountid=11774;;;;;; 413;;; Environment models , Experts , Pathways , Collaboration , Science , Curricula , Engineering education , University colleges , Skills , Interdisciplinary aspects , Sustainability , Clusters , Objectives , Professionals , Environmental management , Decision making , Inquiry method , Climate change , Students , Environmental management , Engineering , Active learning , Data mining , Methodology , Environmental education , Problems , Environmental management , Product development , Design engineering , Texts , Interactive learning , Environmental impact , Strategic planning , Engineering schools , Sustainable development , Process planning , Sustainable development , Sustainable development , Paris Agreement , Problem based learning , Education , Design for recycling , Strategic management , Education , Decision making;;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aeducation&amp;atitle=Roadmapping+towards+sustainability+proficiency+in+engineering+education&amp;title=International+Journal+of+Sustainability+in+Higher+Education&amp;issn=14676370&amp;date=2018-02-15&amp;volume=19&amp;issue=2&amp;spage=413&amp;au=Rodriguez-Andara%2C+Alejandro%3BR%C3%ADo-Belver%2C+Rosa+Mar%C3%ADa%3BRodr%C3%ADguez-Salvador%2C+Marisela%3BLezama-Nicol%C3%A1s%2C+Ren%C3%A9&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=International+Journal+of+Sustainability+in+Higher+Education&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/10.1108%2FIJSHE-06-2017-0079";ProQuest Central,SciTech Premium Collection,Social Science Premium Collection
The Development of an Instrument to Measure the Project Competences of College Students in Online Project-Based Learning;"This study sought to develop a self-report instrument to be used in the assessment of the project competences of college students engaged in online project-based learning. Three scales of the KIPSSE instrument developed for this study, namely, the knowledge integration, project skills, and self-efficacy scales, were based on related theories and the analysis results of three project advisor interviews. Those items of knowledge integration and project skill scales focused on the integration of different disciplines and technological skills separately. Two samples of data were collected from information technology-related courses taught with an online project-based learning strategy over different semesters at a college in southern Taiwan. The validity and reliability of the KIPSSE instrument were confirmed through item analysis and confirmatory factor analysis using structural equation modeling of two samples of students’ online response sets separately. The Cronbach’s alpha reliability coefficient for the entire instrument was 0.931; for each scale, the alpha ranged from 0.832 to 0.907. There was also a significant correlation ( r &#xa0;=&#xa0;0.55, p &#xa0;&lt;&#xa0;0.01) between the KIPSSE instrument results and the students’ product evaluation scores. The findings of this study confirmed the validity and reliability of the KIPSSE instrument. The confirmation process and related implications are also discussed.";2259576672;;;Scholarly Journals; Department of Information Management, Nan Jeon University of Science and Technology, Tainan City, Taiwan, Republic of China;Chien-Liang, Lin;;;; Journal of Science Education and Technology is a copyright of Springer, (2017).

CALL AND PROJECT-BASED LEARNING IN BLENDED AND ONLINE COURSES;Although project-based learning is not new and has been prevalent in K-12 education in the United States since the 1990s, it has remained in the margins of Computer-Assisted Language Learning (CALL) research and discussion. However, it has received increasing attention in research and practice recently. Thus, it is timely and illuminating to revisit the concept and to consider project-based learning in the light of new developments and directions. This article proposes a framework that underlies courses that take a project-based approach to learning by integrating content-based instruction with technological, pedagogical, and content knowledge. The examples show problem-based learning in practice, outlining its use in flipped, blended, and online courses in both English as a Foreign Language (EFL) and English as a Second Language (ESL) higher education environments. This article will analyse three course projects according to the eight essential criteria of goldstandard project-based teaching and learning, and outline the stages of implementation towards the goal - a public product that illustrates the integration of key knowledge, understanding, and success skills. The projects show how technology is leveraged in a constructivist approach that supports content-based instruction and learning in authentic environments. The integration of problem-based learning in blended and online learning settings in both ESL and EFL contexts is strongly recommended.;2342469491;;;Scholarly Journals; Saint Michael's College, USA , Notre Dame University, Lebanon;"Bauer-Ramazani, Christine;Sabieh, Christine";;;; Copyright LinguaBooks Academic Publishing 2018;; Journal Article;;; 2018;;2192-1032;2; English; English;; 85-101; Halifax;2018;European Journal of Applied Linguistics and TEFL;;2018;;;7;https://search.proquest.com/docview/2342469491?accountid=11774;;;;;; 85;;; Higher education , Pedagogy , Collaboration , Teaching methods , Success , English as a second language teaching methods , Content area instruction , Computer assisted language learning , Higher education , Online instruction , Blended learning , Critical thinking , Problem based learning , Leadership , Distance learning , Teachers , English as a second language instruction , Skills , English as a second language--ESL , United States--US;;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aeducation&amp;atitle=CALL+AND+PROJECT-BASED+LEARNING+IN+BLENDED+AND+ONLINE+COURSES&amp;title=European+Journal+of+Applied+Linguistics+and+TEFL&amp;issn=21921032&amp;date=2018-01-01&amp;volume=7&amp;issue=2&amp;spage=85&amp;au=Bauer-Ramazani%2C+Christine%3BSabieh%2C+Christine&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=European+Journal+of+Applied+Linguistics+and+TEFL&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/";ProQuest Central,Social Science Premium Collection
ENHANCING LEARNING OUTCOMES BY INTRODUCING BIM IN CIVIL ENGINEERING STUDIES – EXPERIENCES FROM A UNIVERSITY COLLEGE IN NORWAY;It is a challenge to introduce building information modeling (BIM), as demanded from the industry, in an already packed curriculum for higher engineering education. There is therefore a need for alternative ways to include BIM in the curriculum, while at the same time strengthening – rather than supplanting – the traditional engineering subjects. The purpose of this study is increased understanding of how BIM can be integrated as part of an engineering curriculum in an efficient way. The study is based on an evaluation of the ‘Introduction to Building Professions’ course given to all civil engineering students in their first semester of the bachelor’s degree programme at Oslo and Akershus University College of Applied Sciences in Norway. Autodesk Revit was used as BIM-based software in the designing of a two-family timber dwelling, a compulsory group project in the course. Data for this paper are collected from multiple sources: a net-based questionnaire, course evaluations, interviews with students and teachers, and assessment of students’ project work. Selected factors in Active Learning theories are used as a theoretical lens for analyzing the data in a systematic way. BIM enabled a design and ‘virtual construction’ process where students held professional roles in a design team, and contributed with their expertise toward a holistic solution. The students reported that the hands-on modeling with BIM- based software led to increased understanding of design parameters, load distribution, and construction detailing, as well as information requirements for collaboration within a design team. We conclude that BIM in higher engineering education can support understanding of professional content, which is the primary learning outcome. Software proficiency is seen as a necessary yet subordinate skill in higher education and should not be graded as a separate task. Use of BIM-based software should, however, be integrated to enhance problem understanding and relevant information processing. This integrated approach can lead to a more widespread implementation of BIM to support active learning in higher education.;2254618481;;;Scholarly Journals;;"Lassen, Ann Karina;Hjelseth, Eilif;TOLLNES, TOR";;;; © 2018.

A Case Study Regarding the Role of Accounting Faculty in AACSB Accreditation;"Learning objectives for the Bachelor of Science in Business Administration (BSBA) program are often assessed in capstone management courses instead of accounting courses. As a result, accounting faculty are disconnected from the review visits of regional and discipline-specific accrediting bodies. The first objective of this paper is to describe how accounting faculty contribute directly and indirectly, through lower and upper division accounting courses, to business students 'proficiencies of mission-derived program learning objectives. Here, we examine BSBA assessment results of undergraduate program learning objectives. Additionally, accounting faculty are often involved in improvement actions, known in the accreditation world as ""closing the loop,"" which consist of actions taken in response to findings from conducted assessments. As a result, our second objective is to describe the ""closing the loop"" initiatives undertaken by the accounting faculty in an effort to improve student proficiency levels in various program learning objectives. Overall, this paper contributes to existing literature by describing how accounting faculty play a vital role in the assessment process.";2209862612;;;Scholarly Journals; California State University East Bay , California State University East Bay , California State University East Bay , California State University East Bay;"Tan, John;Frankel, Micah;Taylor, Glen;Luong, Sandy";;" Western Association

Competency Assessment in Problem-Based Learning Projects of Information Technologies Students;The rapid development of new technologies requires a new set of skills from all users in operating, using, and maintaining digitised environments. Curriculum design in the field of Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) undergoes a rapid change as technological achievements do influence education. The aim of the article was to present research results on the mappings of learning outcomes to taxonomies to evolve from requirement-based assessment to competency-based assessment. The research was carried out on the problem-based learning (PBL) module. The article presents a novel PBL model design with activities and evaluation schema. The developed model could be used to guide the curricula design of information technologies for generic competencies, and to foster skills essential for the future ICT sector.;2133811181;;;Scholarly Journals;;"Brilingaitė, Agnė;Bukauskas, Linas;Juškevičienė, Anita";;;; Copyright Institute of Mathematics and Informatics 2018; 10.15388/infedu.2018.02; Journal Article;;; 2018;;1648-5831;1; English; English;; 21-44; Vilnius;2018;Informatics in Education;;2018;;;17;https://search.proquest.com/docview/2133811181?accountid=11774;;;;;; 21;;; Information technology , Taxonomy , Curricula , Learning , Curricula , Problem based learning , Digitization , New technology , Skills;;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aeducation&amp;atitle=Competency+Assessment+in+Problem-Based+Learning+Projects+of+Information+Technologies+Students&amp;title=Informatics+in+Education&amp;issn=16485831&amp;date=2018-01-01&amp;volume=17&amp;issue=1&amp;spage=21&amp;au=Brilingait%C4%97%2C+Agn%C4%97%3BBukauskas%2C+Linas%3BJu%C5%A1kevi%C4%8Dien%C4%97%2C+Anita&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=Informatics+in+Education&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/10.15388%2Finfedu.2018.02";ProQuest Central,SciTech Premium Collection,Social Science Premium Collection
Prioritizing solutions for overcoming knowledge transfer barriers in software development using the fuzzy analytic hierarchy process;An effective knowledge transfer (KT) process is a key factor in achieving the competitive advantage that is critical for software development companies seeking to maintain their existence and improve their performance. However, there do exist obstacles to the achievement of effective knowledge transfer. Companies often face difficulties in identifying those barriers that have the great impact on KT as well as the best solutions with which to address them. Through a systematic literature review and interviews conducted with 15 experts, we identified 21 KT barriers and 12 KT solutions. The barriers were classified into three categories team, project, and technology. Then, using the fuzzy analytic hierarchy process, the identified KT barriers and solutions were ranked. The result of this research is a list of ranked KT barriers and solutions relevant to software development. Poor communication and interpersonal skills, lack of management direction, and challenges to transactive memory systems topped the list of team-, project-, and technology-related barriers, respectively. It was further found that an additional weekly meeting is the best solution with which to overcome the barriers to KT.;2121707186;;;Scholarly Journals;;"Wibowo, Wahyu Catur;Dayanti, Ika Sepfy;Achmad Nizar Hidayanto;Eitiveni, Imairi;Phusavat, Kongkiti";;;; © 2018.

Library space assessment methods: perspectives of new information professionals;"Purpose The research explores the emerging specialty of learning space assessment with a focus on how new information professionals represented by graduate students in an academic libraries course defined quality criteria for library spaces and how they approached designing and conducting a one-shot multi-site space assessment project. Design/methodology/approach The instructor-investigator adopted a diachronic collective case study strategy, using documents generated by six cohorts over three academic years. The data included 180 online discussion posts, 97 individual site assessments and 32 group project reports. Data were analysed quantitatively and qualitatively to identify patterns and trends in student behaviour. Findings The analysis revealed a strong trend among students for creating their own evaluation frameworks in preference to reusing existing professional tools in their current form; the proportion of students who developed their own criteria or combined existing criteria in new ways shifted from 40 per cent to 80 per cent in three years. Their approaches demonstrated willingness and ability to engage in independent and creative thinking, and readiness to explore interdisciplinary and international perspectives on space. They also displayed a commitment to accessible, flexible and adaptable user-centred design for active, collaborative learning and to bringing a user perspective to their observations. Originality/value The focus on student-librarians provides a unique forward-looking perspective on the desirable qualities of next-generation learning spaces in academic libraries. The study documents an unprecedented range of established and novel space evaluation frameworks and tools informed by different professional disciplines. The results should be of interest to library and information science (LIS) educators and practitioners.";2012841336;;;Scholarly Journals; School of Computing and Information, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA;Corrall, Sheila;;;; © Emerald Publishing Limited 2018; 10.1108/ILS-10-2017-0097; Case Study;;; 2018;;2398-5348;1/2; English; English;; 39-63; West Yorkshire;2018;Information and Learning Science;;2018;;;119;https://search.proquest.com/docview/2012841336?accountid=11774;;;;; 2017-10-02 (Received) , 2017-11-13 (Revised) , 2017-11-15 (Accepted); 39;;; Library and information science , Higher education , Librarians , Learning commons , Trends , Academic libraries , Information professionals , Graduate students;;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=unknown&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aabiglobal&amp;atitle=Library+space+assessment+methods%3A+perspectives+of+new+information+professionals&amp;title=Information+and+Learning+Science&amp;issn=23985348&amp;date=2018-01-01&amp;volume=119&amp;issue=1%2F2&amp;spage=39&amp;au=Corrall%2C+Sheila&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=Information+and+Learning+Science&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/10.1108%2FILS-10-2017-0097";ProQuest Central,Social Science Premium Collection
Effectiveness of various innovative learning methods in health science classrooms: a meta-analysis;"This study reports the results of a meta-analysis of the available literature on the effectiveness of various forms of innovative small-group learning methods on student achievement in undergraduate college health science classrooms. The results of the analysis revealed that most of the primary studies supported the effectiveness of the small-group learning methods in improving students’ academic achievement with an overall weighted average effect-size of 0.59 in standard deviation units favoring small-group learning methods. The subgroup analysis showed that the various forms of innovative and reform-based small-group learning interventions appeared to be significantly more effective for students in higher levels of college classes (sophomore, junior, and senior levels), students in other countries (non-U.S.) worldwide, students in groups of four or less, and students who choose their own group. The random-effects meta-regression results revealed that the effect sizes were influenced significantly by the instructional duration of the primary studies. This means that studies with longer hours of instruction yielded higher effect sizes and on average every 1&#xa0;h increase in instruction, the predicted increase in effect size was 0.009 standard deviation units, which is considered as a small effect. These results may help health science and nursing educators by providing guidance in identifying the conditions under which various forms of innovative small-group learning pedagogies are collectively more effective than the traditional lecture-based teaching instruction.";2259113445;;;Scholarly Journals; Eastern Michigan University, Ypsilanti, MI, USA , Indiana Tech University, Fort Wayne, IN, USA;"Kalaian, Sema A;Kasim, Rafa M";;;; Advances in Health Sciences Education is a copyright of Springer, (2017).

Effectiveness of Project Based Learning (Constructivist Learning Approach) on Students Achievement in Science at Secondary Level;Project Based learning (PBL) is a student centered instructional approach used to promote active learning by involving students in investigation real world issues in a collaborative environment. It gives learner's pace of learning, place and learner's control of time. PBL is a innovative teaching method and it is based on constructivist epistemology and pedagogy. In this method, children construct their own knowledge with their own experiences. The main object of the present study is to examine the efficacy of PBL on educational achievement in science at secondary level. This research is based on Pre-test Post-test Control Group Quasi Experimental Design. In this study, one secondary school was selected with the help of simple random sampling technique. All 60 students of class 9th of that school were included in research and they were divided in to two equal groups. There were 30 students in experimental group and 30 students in control group. Researcher used self-made APAT (Air Pollution Achievement Test) for data collection. The Pre-test of APAT administrated on both groups before starting the experiment. After it, the learning opportunities were given to experimental group through PBL and to control group through traditional method to learn chapter air pollution of science subject for 16 days. When treatment was over, Post-test of APAT was administrated by the researcher. An analysis of data was done using both descriptive (Mean, Median, Mode) and inferential (t-test) statistics after collecting data. Hypotheses were tested on 0.05 level of significance. After analysis of data it is found that the educational achievement level of experiment group is more than the achievement level of control group. That's by it is proved that PBL is more effective learning approach than traditional method to learn science.;2012101598;;;Scholarly Journals; Department of Education, School of Education, Mahatma Gandhi Antarrashtriya Hindi Vishwavidyalaya, Wardha, Maharashtra, India;Gangwar, Sumit;;;; Copyright New Delhi Publishers Dec 2017; 10.5958/2230-7311.2017.00129.5; Journal Article;;; Dec 2017;;0976-7258;3; English; English;; 737-741; New Delhi;Dec 2017;Educational Quest;;2017;;;8;https://search.proquest.com/docview/2012101598?accountid=11774;;;;;; 737;;; Students , Collaboration , Teaching methods , Learning , Constructivism , Secondary schools , Academic achievement , Projects , Effectiveness , India;;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aindianjournals&amp;atitle=Effectiveness+of+Project+Based+Learning+%28Constructivist+Learning+Approach%29+on+Students+Achievement+in+Science+at+Secondary+Level&amp;title=Educational+Quest&amp;issn=09767258&amp;date=2017-12-01&amp;volume=8&amp;issue=3&amp;spage=737&amp;au=Gangwar%2C+Sumit&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=Educational+Quest&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/10.5958%2F2230-7311.2017.00129.5";ProQuest Central
Raising the Bar: Challenging Students in a Capstone Project Course with an Android and Mobile Web Parallel Development Team Project;Information systems capstone projects aim to prepare students for what they will encounter in the industry after graduation. Corporate application development is often a complex endeavor that requires coordination between related products. For example, software development in the mobile application sector may require a coordinated parallel development of native cellphone applications and mobile web applications. The dual approach taken by these companies enable end users to access the application over a wide variety of devices and operating systems. Instructors usually must choose between a mobile web development environment and a native development environment such as Android or iPhone. In order to provide students with a learning experience that incorporates additional complexities of the real world, a challenging capstone course project is presented that requires a large team to implement the same application in both environments. This course was implemented in a single semester at Bentley University in the spring of 2015. Student teams created pub crawl applications based on stops within a local mass transit system that would run both on an Android phone and on a mobile website. Java, Eclipse and Google's Android SDK were used to create the Android component. JQuery, HTML5, PHP and JavaScript constituted the development environment used to create the mobile web component. The project management and coordination of the two development environments within a single team resulted in unexpected challenges. Factors leading to varying degrees of successful completion of the team capstone projects are presented along with lessons learned.;1969021040; EJ1151895;;Scholarly Journals;;"Wong, Wilson;Pepe, James;Englander, Irv";;;;;; Article , Report , Undefined , 080: Journal Articles , 141: Reports - Descriptive , 160: Tests/Questionnaires; 1545-679X;; Nov 2017;;;6; English; English;; 27-42;;Nov 2017;Information Systems Education Journal; Scholarly Journals , Reports , Other Sources;2017; http://isedj.org; ERIC, © Information Systems and Computing Academic Professionals;15;https://search.proquest.com/docview/1969021040?accountid=11774;;;;;; 27;;;  10724ER5 1873ER5 10713ER5  10680 1862 10669 ,  4612ER5 3351ER5 3567ER5  4595 3337 3553 ,  5184ER5  5167 ,  10664ER5 3241ER5 6603ER5  10621 3227 6582 ,  10282ER5 9179ER5 126ER5  10240 9146 126 ,  2526ER5  2515 ,  2070ER5  2059 ,  2057ER5 8362ER5  2046 8331 ,  10685ER5 4527ER5 912ER5  10642 4511 909 ,  10247ER5 3640ER5  10205 3626 ,  8330ER5  8299 ,  1815ER5 10321ER5 8043ER5 4558ER5  1806 10278 8016 4542 , Massachusetts; Higher Education , Massachusetts;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aeric&amp;atitle=Raising+the+Bar%3A+Challenging+Students+in+a+Capstone+Project+Course+with+an+Android+and+Mobile+Web+Parallel+Development+Team+Project&amp;title=Information+Systems+Education+Journal&amp;issn=1545-679X&amp;date=2017-11-01&amp;volume=15&amp;issue=6&amp;spage=27&amp;au=Wong%2C+Wilson%3BPepe%2C+James%3BEnglander%2C+Irv&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=Information+Systems+Education+Journal&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/EJ1151895&amp;rft_id=info:doi/";Social Science Premium Collection
Learning attitudes and problem-solving attitudes for blended problem-based learning;"Purpose The purpose of this paper is to present the design and implementation of a blended problem-based learning (PBL) teaching model and corresponding teaching materials for a university-level bioinformatics course. The effects of this teaching model on student performance in terms of problem solving and learning attitudes were investigated. Design/methodology/approach Students in both groups completed assessments of problem-solving attitudes and learning attitudes both one week both before and after experimental instruction. Collected data were analyzed using one-way ANCOVA. Group discussions and student interviews were recorded and treated as part of the data analysis. Findings The study produced the following findings: the experimental group was found to perform better than the control group in terms of learning attitudes, but the results were not statistically significant; the experimental group was found to outperform the control group in terms of problem-solving attitudes, and the difference was statistically significant; lesson plan contents need to be designed based on problem-based learning theory, and reflect real-world conditions; participants in the experimental group approved of the blended PBL and group discussion approach. Originality/value Results are expected to provide a useful reference for educators and researchers. These findings can be applied to relevant instructional fields to enhance learner motivation and engagement, thus improving learning outcomes.";2005056140;;;Scholarly Journals;;"Tsai, Meng-Hsiun;Tang, Ya-Chun";;;; © Emerald Publishing Limited 2017; 10.1108/LHT-06-2017-0102; Journal Article;;; 2017;;0737-8831;4; English; English;; 615-628; Bradford;2017;Library Hi Tech;;2017;;;35;https://search.proquest.com/docview/2005056140?accountid=11774;;;;;; 615;;; Problem solving , Teaching , Data analysis , Learning , Bioinformatics , Group dynamics , Online instruction , Learning theory , Blended learning , Problem based learning , Distance learning , Bioinformatics , Problem solving , Significance , Colleges & universities;;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aabiglobal&amp;atitle=Learning+attitudes+and+problem-solving+attitudes+for+blended+problem-based+learning&amp;title=Library+Hi+Tech&amp;issn=07378831&amp;date=2017-10-01&amp;volume=35&amp;issue=4&amp;spage=615&amp;au=Tsai%2C+Meng-Hsiun%3BTang%2C+Ya-Chun&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=Library+Hi+Tech&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/10.1108%2FLHT-06-2017-0102";ProQuest Central,SciTech Premium Collection,Social Science Premium Collection

Empowering Students to Actively Learn Systems Analysis and Design: The Success of an Entrepreneurial-Inspired Project in a Hybrid Learning Environment;"Systems Analysis and Design (SA&amp;D) is the cornerstone course of a traditional information system curriculum. Conventionally, it is a sequence of two courses with the second course dedicated to the completion of a project. However, it has recently become more common to reduce the two-course sequence into one, especially for IS departments that are only concentrations of a business school and not independent departments. Not only has the original sequence been reduced to one course, but the course is also offered to non-technical business students. It is challenging to design a successful SA&amp;D course that is subject to these constraints. In this article, the author showcases a modified SA&amp;D hybrid course enriched by a real-life entrepreneurial-inspired project with a double review development process model. A survey conducted at the conclusion of the course shows that the new approach works well and holds great promise for improving future SA&amp;D courses.";1969021006; EJ1151888;;Scholarly Journals;;Wong, Wang-chan;;;;;; Article , Undefined , Report , 080: Journal Articles , 160: Tests/Questionnaires , 143: Reports - Research; 1545-679X;; Sep 2017;;;5; English; English;; 68-83;;Sep 2017;Information Systems Education Journal; Scholarly Journals , Other Sources , Reports;2017; http://isedj.org; ERIC, © Information Systems and Computing Academic Professionals;15;https://search.proquest.com/docview/1969021006?accountid=11774;;;;;; 68;;;  10464ER5 6603ER5  10421 6582 ,  2780ER5  2768 ,  1063ER5 10664ER5 3241ER5 6603ER5  1060 10621 3227 6582 ,  3527ER5  3513 ,  5184ER5  5167 ,  1207ER5 8290ER5 3164ER5  1204 8260 3150 ,  10303ER5 10423ER5 3643ER5 6603ER5  10260 10380 3629 6582 ,  124ER5 5901ER5  124 5882 ,  1815ER5 10321ER5 8043ER5 4558ER5  1806 10278 8016 4542 ,  10685ER5 4527ER5 912ER5  10642 4511 909 ,  8330ER5  8299 ,  10282ER5 9179ER5 126ER5  10240 9146 126 ,  4846ER5 677ER5 5259ER5 4831ER5 10324ER5 5902ER5 126ER5  4829 4814 10281 5883 126 675 5242 ,  10833ER5 6468ER5  10789 6447 ,  2703ER5 9591ER5  2691 9556 ,  2526ER5  2515 ,  2070ER5  2059 ,  10719ER5  10675 , California; Higher Education , California;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aeric&amp;atitle=Empowering+Students+to+Actively+Learn+Systems+Analysis+and+Design%3A+The+Success+of+an+Entrepreneurial-Inspired+Project+in+a+Hybrid+Learning+Environment&amp;title=Information+Systems+Education+Journal&amp;issn=1545-679X&amp;date=2017-09-01&amp;volume=15&amp;issue=5&amp;spage=68&amp;au=Wong%2C+Wang-chan&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=Information+Systems+Education+Journal&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/EJ1151888&amp;rft_id=info:doi/";Social Science Premium Collection
The use of task modeling in interactive system specification;Task modeling is undoubtedly a key step for task analysis during the development of iterative systems since it helps not only in the understanding of what users want but also in how to design for them. As a consequence, it should be considered as indispensable while specifying the requirements of an interactive system. With this in mind, we analyzed the requirement specifications of a typical interactive system which is a compulsory element of the final grade for a human-computer interaction course in two Master's degree programs at the University of Valenciennes. To that end, we decided to use an approach based on project-based learning. Sixty-three requirement specifications performed since 2010 were investigated to find out how the task modeling was represented. Moreover, suggestions concerning pedagogical improvement made by the students in an open question on the evaluation form were analyzed using the ground theory method. The results showed that since students are not required to perform task modeling by the requirement specification, they do not do so even in the case of complex interactive systems. Criticism, positive and improvement issues raised by the students were also identified. In this paper, we present a detailed analysis of this study that opens up questions about HCI education and effective learning of task modeling, and, as a consequence, its potential use in industry.;1935912964;;;Scholarly Journals; LAMIH CNRS UMR 8201, University of Valenciennes and Hainaut-Cambrésis, Valenciennes Cedex 9, France , LAMIH CNRS UMR 8201, University of Valenciennes and Hainaut-Cambrésis, Valenciennes Cedex 9, France , LAMIH CNRS UMR 8201, University of Valenciennes and Hainaut-Cambrésis, Valenciennes Cedex 9, France;"Gonçalves, Taisa Guidini;de Oliveira, Káthia Marçal;Kolski, Christophe";;;; Cognition, Technology and Work is a copyright of Springer, 2017.; 10.1007/s10111-017-0427-1; Journal Article;;; Sep 2017;;1435-5558;2-3; English; English;; 493-515; London;Sep 2017;Cognition, Technology & Work;;2017;;;19;https://search.proquest.com/docview/1935912964?accountid=11774;;;;;; 493;;; Task analysis , Systems design , Man machine interaction , Interactive computer systems; Task modeling , User interface design , HCI education , Project-based learning , Case study;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Apsychology&amp;atitle=The+use+of+task+modeling+in+interactive+system+specification&amp;title=Cognition%2C+Technology+%26+Work&amp;issn=14355558&amp;date=2017-09-01&amp;volume=19&amp;issue=2-3&amp;spage=493&amp;au=Gon%C3%A7alves%2C+Taisa+Guidini%3Bde+Oliveira%2C+K%C3%A1thia+Mar%C3%A7al%3BKolski%2C+Christophe&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=Cognition%2C+Technology+%26+Work&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/10.1007%2Fs10111-017-0427-1";ProQuest Central,Social Science Premium Collection
Teaching Complex Concepts in the Geosciences by Integrating Analytical Reasoning With GIS;Conceptual models have long served as a means for physical geographers to organize their understanding of feedback mechanisms and complex systems. Analytical reasoning provides undergraduate students with an opportunity to develop conceptual models based upon their understanding of surface processes and environmental conditions. This study describes the use of analytical reasoning by junior and senior undergraduate students to predict the expansion and contraction of the South Texas Sandsheet as an example of this instructional technique. Students perceived that the analytical reasoning approach was significantly better for understanding desert expansion and contraction compared with the traditional lecture. A preliminary assessment of an analytical reasoning approach to desertification is presented as an example of how this approach can be incorporated into undergraduate geoscience courses.;1940122746;;;Scholarly Journals; Department: of Earth and Environmental Sciences, University of Windsor, 401 Sunset Avenue, Windsor, Ontario, Canada, N9B 3P4 , Department of Geography, Center for Geospatial Sciences, Applications and Technology, Texas A&M University, College Station, Texas 777433147, USA , Department of Social Sciences, College of Liberal & Fine Arts, Tarleton State University, Stephenville, Texas 76402, USA;"Houser, Chris;Bishop, Michael P;Lemmons, Kelly";;;; Copyright National Association of Geoscience Teachers Aug 2017; 10.5408/16-152.1; Journal Article;;; Aug 2017;;1089-9995;3; English; English;; 263-271; Bellingham;Aug 2017;Journal of Geoscience Education;;2017;;;65;https://search.proquest.com/docview/1940122746?accountid=11774;;;;;; 263;;; Desertification , Teaching , Study abroad , Higher education , Mathematical analysis , Public speaking , Student participation , STEM education , Complex systems , Educational technology , Core curriculum , Inquiry method , Environmental conditions , Students , System theory , Geography , College faculty , Reflective teaching , Classrooms , Active learning , Satellite navigation systems , Geomorphology , Science education , Knowledge , Reasoning , Desertification , Earth science , Geographic information systems , Problem based learning;;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aeducation&amp;atitle=Teaching+Complex+Concepts+in+the+Geosciences+by+Integrating+Analytical+Reasoning+With+GIS&amp;title=Journal+of+Geoscience+Education&amp;issn=10899995&amp;date=2017-08-01&amp;volume=65&amp;issue=3&amp;spage=263&amp;au=Houser%2C+Chris%3BBishop%2C+Michael+P%3BLemmons%2C+Kelly&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=Journal+of+Geoscience+Education&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/10.5408%2F16-152.1";ProQuest Central,SciTech Premium Collection,Social Science Premium Collection
Learning in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics: Supporting Students With Learning Disabilities;Despite their intellectual potential, students with learning disabilities (LDs) face enormous challenges in science. Drawing on the literature from special, inclusive, and science education, this paper illuminates the promises and challenges of supporting students with LDs in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education. In light of the insights from research in these diverse fields, this work offers a comprehensive framework to understand and address the unique needs of students with LDs in STEM learning. This multidimensional analysis provides an overview of the contemporary discourses on STEM education, presents the continuing controversies surrounding the conceptualization of LDs, and discusses the barriers to the inclusion of students with LDs in science classrooms. Because difficulties in cognitive processing are thought to underlie LDs, this paper particularly focuses on the cognitive impediments to the achievement of students with LDs in problem-based STEM learning tasks and shares effective interventions to support these students' cognitive development.;1931595391;;;Scholarly Journals; Department of Integrated Studies in Education, Faculty of Education, McGill University, 3700 McTavish Street, Montreal, QC, H3A 1Y2, Quebec, Canada.

Practice-Based Learning in LIS Education: An Overview of Current Trends;Practice-based learning (PBL) has been a staple of the preservice curricula of Library and Information Science (LIS) programs. While the status/importance of PBL continues to be debated in LIS education in the United States, an increasing number of programs offer these experiences to their students in the form of practicums, internships, fieldwork, service learning, or community-based projects. This article will look at the most recent statistical data on fieldwork experiences offered by LIS schools and examine the ways in which these practical experiences are organized and infused throughout the curricula. While the focus will be programs accredited by the American Library Association in the United States, reference will be made to international curricula where applicable.;2030917529;;;Scholarly Journals;;Huggins, Sujin;;" American Library Association

Using Virtual Tools to Support Collaborative Learning in Design Education;An increasingly popular topic of discussion relating to higher education learning methodology is online learning, particularly online collaborative learning (Resta and Laferrière, 2007). With the emergence of 'Web 2.0' there are currently a multitude of CSCW (Computer-Supported Cooperative Work) tools available which facilitate such work strategies. There is however dispute surrounding the effectiveness of such methods and the level of adoption by the student population. One particular field in which group working and group based projects feature extensively is the design industry. It could be expected therefore that undergraduate design students in particular, being considered 'digital natives', would be utilising the available online collaborative work tools to their full potential. Whilst it is safe to assume that some level of online collaborative working takes place within the course of these assignments it is currently unclear to what extent these tools are utilised or what forms these tools take. Through the evaluation of data obtained from undergraduate design students at Loughborough University on the level of uptake of online collaborative work tools within the context of group projects and assignments, the aim of this paper is to provide suggestions for possible ways to improve the adoption of online collaborative work tools within undergraduate design education.;2022273938;;;Scholarly Journals;;"Page, Tom;Thorsteinsson, Gisli";;;; 2017 i-manager publications.

Role-Playing and Problem-Based Learning: The Use of Cross-Functional Student Teams in Business Application Development;"To create a learning experience which replicates the process by which consultants, systems developers and business end users collaborate to design and implement a business application, a cross-functional student team project was developed and is described. The overall learning experience was distinguished by specific components and characteristics of the project, including: 1) a problem-based learning approach which presented students with an accounting auditing problem requiring the design and development of computer-based application from scratch; 2) the formation of cross-functional teams comprised of students across multiple sections of two different courses (the capstone courses for both Accounting and Information Systems); and 3) the contributions of individual students based on their respective backgrounds and roles in the project. The roles included domain/content experts (accounting students) as well as consultants, business analysts and developers (information systems students). The intentional use of cross-functional teams and assigned roles distinguishes this approach from other problem-based approaches. Further, the teams had additional extrinsic motivation as the business applications they developed could be submitted to a contest hosted by a professional organization. Pre- and post-assessment data indicate that students learned, through iteration and trial-and-error, new interpersonal, analytical and technical skills through client-consultant interactions, problem definition and formulation, requirements analysis, business process and data modeling and application development.";1941341866; EJ1144676;;Scholarly Journals;;"Pike, Jacqueline C.;Spangler, William;Williams, Valerie;Kollar, Robert";;;;;; Article , Report , 080: Journal Articles , 143: Reports - Research; 1545-679X;; Jul 2017;;;4; English; English;; 75-83;;Jul 2017;Information Systems Education Journal; Scholarly Journals , Reports;2017; http://isedj.org; ERIC, © Information Systems and Computing Academic Professionals;15;https://search.proquest.com/docview/1941341866?accountid=11774;;;;;; 75;;;  9054ER5 9687ER5 6603ER5  9021 9651 6582 ,  8257ER5 5901ER5  8227 5882 ,  5385ER5 6603ER5  5368 6582 ,  10685ER5 4527ER5 912ER5  10642 4511 909 ,  11139ER5 1815ER5 10321ER5 8043ER5 4558ER5  11095 1806 10278 8016 4542 ,  1207ER5 8290ER5 3164ER5  1204 8260 3150 ,  89ER5 10713ER5  89 10669 ,  5184ER5  5167 ,  8263ER5 1719ER5  8233 1710 ,  6276ER5 10321ER5 8043ER5 4558ER5  6256 10278 8016 4542 ,  3724ER5  3709 ,  10296ER5 9048ER5  10254 9015 ,  9721ER5 5070ER5 2799ER5  9685 5053 2787 ,  5923ER5 1719ER5  5904 1710 ,  5465ER5 1981ER5 1ER5  5446 1970 1 ,  10896ER5 1708ER5 1ER5 9726ER5  10852 1701 1 9690 ,  1228ER5 9726ER5 1ER5  1223 9690 1 ,  7480ER5  7454; Higher Education , Postsecondary Education;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aeric&amp;atitle=Role-Playing+and+Problem-Based+Learning%3A+The+Use+of+Cross-Functional+Student+Teams+in+Business+Application+Development&amp;title=Information+Systems+Education+Journal&amp;issn=1545-679X&amp;date=2017-07-01&amp;volume=15&amp;issue=4&amp;spage=75&amp;au=Pike%2C+Jacqueline+C.%3BSpangler%2C+William%3BWilliams%2C+Valerie%3BKollar%2C+Robert&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=Information+Systems+Education+Journal&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/EJ1144676&amp;rft_id=info:doi/";Social Science Premium Collection

From the islands of knowledge to a shared understanding: interdisciplinarity and technology literacy for innovation in smart electronic product design;"In the context of the evolving Internet, a balance between technological advances and meaning change is crucial to develop innovative and breakthrough ""connected electronics"" that enable the Internet of Things. Designers and technologists are key enablers of this process respectively, ensuring adequate users' needs and technology development, inside the evolving context of social environment and human relations. Smart electronic product design must be a truly interdisciplinary process, in which technologists are aware of how much their decisions impact the user-product relationship and designers understand the full potential and associated limitations of technology involved. Shared knowledge and communication are essential in this scenario, but, due to their technological limitations, designers are often excluded from high-level decision processes. In this paper, we address the design of constructivist tools and associated strategy to enhance the technological literacy of designers, as a strong foundation for knowledge-based dialogue between these realms. We demonstrate its effectiveness in a long-term multidisciplinary Project-Based Learning application with Design and Electronics students. We present the cases from 2 years' experimentation (with the first year as control group) that demonstrate improvement in the quality of teamwork; in learning results; improved performance of the students reflected in the quality of the projects developed; and positive teachers' and students' evaluations. We conclude that the use of the proposed tool not only provides the designer an active voice in the process of designing smart electronics, but also promotes an effective common language between these two worlds.";1901185741;;;Scholarly Journals;" Aragon Institute of Engineering Research, Universidad de Zaragoza, Saragossa, Spain; Department of Design Engineering and Manufacturing, University of Zaragoza, Saragossa, Spain , Aragon Institute of Engineering Research, Universidad de Zaragoza, Saragossa, Spain; Department of Electronic Engineering and Communications, University of Zaragoza, Saragossa, Spain , Department of Design Engineering and Manufacturing, University of Zaragoza, Saragossa, Spain , Aragon Institute of Engineering Research, Universidad de Zaragoza, Saragossa, Spain , Department of Electronic Engineering and Communications, University of Zaragoza, Saragossa, Spain";"Blanco, Teresa;Casas, Roberto;Manchado-pérez, Eduardo;Asensio, Ángel;López-pérez, Jose M";;;; International Journal of Technology and Design Education is a copyright of Springer, 2017.; 10.1007/s10798-015-9347-7; Journal Article;;; Jun 2017;;0957-7572;2; English; English;; 329-362; Dordrecht;Jun 2017;International Journal of Technology and Design Education;;2017;;;27;https://search.proquest.com/docview/1901185741?accountid=11774;;;;;; 329;;; Product design , Electronics , Computer literacy , Interdisciplinary aspects , Electronics , Evolution , Technologists , Literacy , Knowledge base , Product design , Human relations , Voice communication , Experimentation , Students , Innovations , Projects , Technology , Innovations , Internet of Things; Technology literacy , Design , Smart electronics , Teamwork , Shared understanding , Collaborative learning;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aeducation&amp;atitle=From+the+islands+of+knowledge+to+a+shared+understanding%3A+interdisciplinarity+and+technology+literacy+for+innovation+in+smart+electronic+product+design&amp;title=International+Journal+of+Technology+and+Design+Education&amp;issn=09577572&amp;date=2017-06-01&amp;volume=27&amp;issue=2&amp;spage=329&amp;au=Blanco%2C+Teresa%3BCasas%2C+Roberto%3BManchado-p%C3%A9rez%2C+Eduardo%3BAsensio%2C+%C3%81ngel%3BL%C3%B3pez-p%C3%A9rez%2C+Jose+M&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=International+Journal+of+Technology+and+Design+Education&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/10.1007%2Fs10798-015-9347-7";Art, Design & Architecture Collection,ProQuest Central,SciTech Premium Collection,Social Science Premium Collection
The use of wikis in a science inquiry-based project in a primary school;This study explored the use of wikis in a science inquiry-based project conducted with Primary 6 students (aged 11-12). It used an online wiki-based platform called PBworks and addressed the following research questions: (1) What are students' attitudes toward learning with wikis? (2) What are students' interactions in online group collaboration with wikis? (3) What have students learned with wikis in a science inquiry-based project in a primary school context? Analyses of the quantitative and qualitative data showed that with respect to the first research question, the students held positive attitudes toward the platform at the end of the study. With respect to the second research question, the students actively engaged in various forms of learning-related interactions using the platform that extended to more meaningful offline interactions. With respect to the third research question, the students developed Internet search skills, collaborative problem solving competencies, and critical inquiry abilities. It is concluded that a well-planned wiki-based learning experience, framed within an inquiry project-based approach facilitated by students' online collaborative knowledge construction, is conducive to the learning and teaching of science inquiry-based projects in primary school.;1899718333;;;Scholarly Journals; Department of Curriculum and Instruction, Faculty of Education, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong SAR, China , Faculty of Education, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong SAR, China , Faculty of Education, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong SAR, China;"Lau, Wilfred W; F;Lui, Vicky;Chu, Samuel K; W";;;; Educational Technology Research and Development is a copyright of Springer, 2017.; 10.1007/s11423-016-9479-9; Journal Article;;; Jun 2017;;1042-1629;3; English; English;; 533-553; New York;Jun 2017;Educational Technology, Research and Development;;2017;;;65;https://search.proquest.com/docview/1899718333?accountid=11774;;;;;; 533;;; Students , Collaboration , Science , Wikis , Inquiry method , Learning; Wikis , Inquiry-based learning , Project-based learning , Inquiry project-based learning , Science education , Primary education;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Apsychology&amp;atitle=The+use+of+wikis+in+a+science+inquiry-based+project+in+a+primary+school&amp;title=Educational+Technology%2C+Research+and+Development&amp;issn=10421629&amp;date=2017-06-01&amp;volume=65&amp;issue=3&amp;spage=533&amp;au=Lau%2C+Wilfred+W%3B+F%3BLui%2C+Vicky%3BChu%2C+Samuel+K%3B+W&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=Educational+Technology%2C+Research+and+Development&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/10.1007%2Fs11423-016-9479-9";ProQuest Central,Social Science Premium Collection
Using Visualization to Motivate Student Participation in Collaborative Online Learning Environments;Online participation in collaborative online learning environments is instrumental in motivating students to learn and promoting their learning satisfaction, but there has been little research on the technical supports for motivating students’ online participation. The purpose of this study was to develop a visualization tool to motivate learners to participate actively in collaborative online learning communities and examine its effects on online participation, perceived learning, perceived satisfaction, team project performance, and usability. Two types of visualization tool were developed: the A-type for representing group participation and interaction between groups, and the B-type for representing group participation and individual participation. Undergraduate students (N = 118) were assigned randomly to one of three groups (A and B: experimental group, C: control group). The results showed that two types of visualization tool have significant effects on the perceived satisfaction, perceived learning, and team project performance. Regarding online participation, the B-type of visualization tool was found to be effective. The usability of the A and B groups was similar and many learners in both groups reported that the visualization tool motivated them to participate in online learning. Theoretical, empirical and practical discussions are provided based on the results.;1902839846;;;Scholarly Journals;;Sung-Hee, Jin;;;; © 2017.

The Open Wings project: Transforming students' perceptions of self and society through the development of the homonomous self;"  Purpose The purpose of this paper is to report the implementation and outcomes of the ""Open Wings"" project, a continuing effort to create a community of self-directed elementary school learners and to enhance their homonomy. Technology-enhanced international videoconference presentations resulted in both knowledge gains and attitude changes. These, in turn, inspired creative, collaborative interdisciplinary projects through which students demonstrated that they could embed themselves in contexts that contribute to homonomous identification and development. Design/methodology/approach Over the 2015-2016 school year, interactive international videoconferences were delivered to first and sixth grade classrooms in two elementary schools in Athens, Greece. Topics included a personal immigration story and responsible citizenship. Impact was measured quantitatively by a pre-test/post-test design that measured changes in knowledge and attitudes and qualitatively by student group projects at six stations inspired by e-reflect methodology. Findings Students demonstrated gains in factual knowledge and changes in attitudes toward immigrants and refugees. Individual and group work at each station revealed that they could plan, research, and present projects that demonstrated their personal sense of self and their place in the community. Originality/value With many in Greece directly affected by the economic crisis and an influx of refugees and immigrants, students feel they have no control over their lives and become fearful of outsiders. Even when resources are limited, innovative use of learning technologies can help educate students in the prescribed curriculum and guide them beyond hopelessness to see themselves as empowered individuals who can enrich their own lives and those of their communities.";1879964600;;;Scholarly Journals;;"Pyrini, Nancy;Varonis, Orestes Johns;Varonis, Evangeline Marlos";;;; © Emerald Publishing Limited 2017;; Case Study;;; 2017;;2056-4880;2; English; English;; 83-101; Bingley;2017;The International Journal of Information and Learning Technology;;2017;;;34;https://search.proquest.com/docview/1879964600?accountid=11774;;;;;; 83;;; Students , Elementary schools , Minority & ethnic groups , Core curriculum , Adult education , Learning , Economic crisis , Refugees , Community , Independent study , Interdisciplinary aspects , Greece;;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=unknown&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aabiglobal&amp;atitle=The+Open+Wings+project%3A+Transforming+students%27+perceptions+of+self+and+society+through+the+development+of+the+homonomous+self&amp;title=The+International+Journal+of+Information+and+Learning+Technology&amp;issn=20564880&amp;date=2017-03-15&amp;volume=34&amp;issue=2&amp;spage=83&amp;au=Pyrini%2C+Nancy%3BVaronis%2C+Orestes+Johns%3BVaronis%2C+Evangeline+Marlos&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=The+International+Journal+of+Information+and+Learning+Technology&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/";ProQuest Central,SciTech Premium Collection,Social Science Premium Collection
Assessing changes in teachers' attitudes toward interdisciplinary STEM teaching;"  Integrating engineering and technology concepts into K-12 science and math curricula through engineering design project-based learning has been found to increase students' interest in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM), however preparing teachers to shift to interdisciplinary teaching remains a significant challenge. Primarily teachers need to develop both skills and attitudes toward interdisciplinary teaching. In doing so, professional development (PD) is considered a key component in helping teachers through this transformation process. In an educational environment of accountability, measuring the effects of PD programs on teacher behaviors and capacity is essential but often elusive. The current study describes the change in attitudes to interdisciplinary teaching of 29 self-selected middle and high school teachers who participated a PD workshop and in delivering a 12-15 week interdisciplinary teaching and design problem unit that spanned multiple STEM subjects. This quasi-experimental pilot study implemented a single group pretest-posttest design using survey methods to collect data from the participants at two intervals; at the time of the PD workshop and at the completion of the teaching unit that emphasized a long-term engineering design problem. The goals of this research are to (1) assess the changes in attitudes to interdisciplinary teaching, attitudes to teamwork, teaching satisfaction, and resistance to change, (2) explore relationships among these changes, (3) and describe the variation in these changes across teachers' gender, school level, discipline taught, and education level.";1867931018;;;Scholarly Journals;;"Al Salami, Mubarak K;Makela, Carole J;de Miranda, Michael A";;;; International Journal of Technology and Design Education is a copyright of Springer, 2017.; 10.1007/s10798-015-9341-0; Journal Article;;; Mar 2017;;0957-7572;1; English; English;; 63-88; Dordrecht;Mar 2017;International Journal of Technology and Design Education;;2017;;;27;https://search.proquest.com/docview/1867931018?accountid=11774;;; References;;; 63;;; STEM education , Teacher attitudes , Technology education , Engineering , Professional development; Interdisciplinary STEM teaching , Teacher professional development , Engineering design , Teacher attitudes , K-12 STEM education;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aeducation&amp;atitle=Assessing+changes+in+teachers%27+attitudes+toward+interdisciplinary+STEM+teaching&amp;title=International+Journal+of+Technology+and+Design+Education&amp;issn=09577572&amp;date=2017-03-01&amp;volume=27&amp;issue=1&amp;spage=63&amp;au=Al+Salami%2C+Mubarak+K%3BMakela%2C+Carole+J%3Bde+Miranda%2C+Michael+A&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=International+Journal+of+Technology+and+Design+Education&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/10.1007%2Fs10798-015-9341-0";Art, Design & Architecture Collection,ProQuest Central,SciTech Premium Collection,Social Science Premium Collection
Towards effective group work assessment: even what you don't see can bias you;  In project-based learning (PBL) courses, which are common in design and technology education, instructors regard both the process and the final product to be important. However, conducting an accurate assessment for process feedback is not an easy task because instructors of PBL courses often have to make judgments based on a limited view of group work. In this paper, we provide explanations about how in practice instructors actually exhibit cognitive biases and judgments made using incomplete information in the context of an engineering design education classroom. More specifically, we hypothesize that instructors would be susceptible to human errors that are well known in social psychology, the halo effect and the fundamental attribution error, because they have a limited view of group work when they facilitate distributed and remote groups. Through this study, we present two main contributions, namely (1) insights based on classroom data about limitations of current instructor assessment practices, (2) an illustration of using principles from social psychology as a lens for exploring important design questions for designing tools that monitor support oversight of group work. In addition to the study, we illustrate how the findings from our classroom study can be used for effective group assessments.;1867930790;;;Scholarly Journals;;"Gweon, Gahgene;Jun, Soojin;Finger, Susan;Rosé, Carolyn Penstein";;;; International Journal of Technology and Design Education is a copyright of Springer, 2017.; 10.1007/s10798-015-9332-1; Journal Article;;; Mar 2017;;0957-7572;1; English; English;; 165-180; Dordrecht;Mar 2017;International Journal of Technology and Design Education;;2017;;;27;https://search.proquest.com/docview/1867930790?accountid=11774;;; References;;; 165;;; Group dynamics , Teamwork , Collaborative learning , Interactive learning; Instructor assessment , Halo effect , Fundamental attribution error , Project-based learning , Group work;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aeducation&amp;atitle=Towards+effective+group+work+assessment%3A+even+what+you+don%27t+see+can+bias+you&amp;title=International+Journal+of+Technology+and+Design+Education&amp;issn=09577572&amp;date=2017-03-01&amp;volume=27&amp;issue=1&amp;spage=165&amp;au=Gweon%2C+Gahgene%3BJun%2C+Soojin%3BFinger%2C+Susan%3BRos%C3%A9%2C+Carolyn+Penstein&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=International+Journal+of+Technology+and+Design+Education&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/10.1007%2Fs10798-015-9332-1";Art, Design & Architecture Collection,ProQuest Central,SciTech Premium Collection,Social Science Premium Collection
Yeast for Mathematicians: A Ferment of Discovery and Model Competition to Describe Data;  In addition to the memorization, algorithmic skills and vocabulary which are the default focus in many mathematics classrooms, professional mathematicians are expected to creatively apply known techniques, construct new mathematical approaches and communicate with and about mathematics. We propose that students can learn these professional, higher-level skills through Laboratory Experiences in Mathematical Biology which put students in the role of mathematics researcher creating mathematics to describe and understand biological data. Here we introduce a laboratory experience centered on yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) growing in a small capped flask with a jar to collect carbon dioxide created during yeast growth and respiration. The lab requires no specialized equipment and can easily be run in the context of a college math class. Students collect data and develop mathematical models to explain the data. To help place instructors in the role of mentor/collaborator (as opposed to jury/judge), we facilitate the lab using model competition judged via Bayesian Information Criterion. This article includes details about the class activity conducted, student examples and pedagogical strategies for success.;1865257930;;;Scholarly Journals;;"Lewis, Matthew;Powell, James";;;; Bulletin of Mathematical Biology is a copyright of Springer, 2017.; 10.1007/s11538-016-0236-3; Journal Article;;; Feb 2017;;0092-8240;2; English; English;; 356-382; New York;Feb 2017;Bulletin of Mathematical Biology;;2017;;;79;https://search.proquest.com/docview/1865257930?accountid=11774;;;;;; 356;;;; Problem-based learning , Biomath labs , Sacchromyces cerevisae , Laboratory experience , Mathematical biology;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aengineeringjournals&amp;atitle=Yeast+for+Mathematicians%3A+A+Ferment+of+Discovery+and+Model+Competition+to+Describe+Data&amp;title=Bulletin+of+Mathematical+Biology&amp;issn=00928240&amp;date=2017-02-01&amp;volume=79&amp;issue=2&amp;spage=356&amp;au=Lewis%2C+Matthew%3BPowell%2C+James&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=Bulletin+of+Mathematical+Biology&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/10.1007%2Fs11538-016-0236-3";ProQuest Central,SciTech Premium Collection
"""From Making to Learning"": introducing Dev Camps as an educational paradigm for Re-inventing Problem-based Learning: Revista de Universidad y Sociedad del Conocimiento";"Dev Camps are events that enable participants to tackle challenges using software tools and different kinds of hardware devices in collaborative project-style activities. The participants conceptualize and develop their solutions in a self-directed way, involving technical, organizational and social skills. In this sense, they are autonomous producers or ""makers"". The Dev Camp activity format resonates with skills such as communication, critical thinking, creativity, decision-making and planning and can be considered as a bridge between education and industry.

Democratizing digital learning: theorizing the fully online learning community model: Revista de Universidad y Sociedad del Conocimiento;The integration of digital technologies at institutions of higher education are profoundly influencing formal learning on a global scale. Social-constructivist models of fully online learning are well-positioned to address the demands of government, and economic and social-development organizations for civically-engaged individuals with strong problem-solving, critical-thinking and collaboration competencies. With an established record of performance at the University of Ontario Institute of Technology (UOIT), Canada, the Fully Online Learning Community (FOLC) is one such model. This paper theorizes FOLC as a response to several problematics, including (a) the aforementioned demand for greater educational focus on higher-order competency development, (b) the deficiencies of distance education and MOOCs as learning models, and (c) a quest for new learning models that strengthen deliberation skills and deepen democratic experience. As a divergent fork of the Community of Inquiry model, FOLC describes collaborative learning as a symbiosis of social and cognitive interactions amplified through effective use of synchronous and asynchronous digital affordances. Furthermore, it models democratized learning communities that reduce transactional distance between learners and educators, incorporates authentic assessment, and encourages negotiated technology affordances and cognitive outcomes while distributing responsibility for constructive criticality. Having positioned FOLC conceptually, and addressed current limitations, a research agenda for extending its empirical foundations, and leveraging UOIT's EILAB affordances, is presented. The underlying argument is that self-regulating and transformative learning communities can be established and sustained in fully online environments, and that such communities (a) produce a diversity of beneficial learning outcomes, and (b) deepen the democratic functioning of learners and their social contexts.;2147573869;;;Scholarly Journals; University of Ontario Institute of Technology, Oshawa, Canada , University of Ontario Institute of Technology, Oshawa, Canada , University of Ontario Institute of Technology, Oshawa, Canada , University of Ontario Institute of Technology, Oshawa, Canada;"Blayone, Todd J B;vanOostveen, Roland;Barber, Wendy;DiGiuseppe, Maurice;Childs, Elizabeth";;" World Economic Forum

How to merge courses via Skype™†? Lessons from an International Blended Learning Project‡: Association for Learning Technology Journal;This study reports on an international project in which students taking the course Contemporary Issues in Turkish Politics in spring 2011 and fall 2011 at two institutions of higher education, ‘Gettysburg College’ in the United States and ‘Izmir University of Economics’ in Turkey, worked together in virtual learning environments to complete various tasks as part of their course work. The project employed a blend of traditional and technology-based teaching methods in order to introduce a technology like Skype in a bi-national learning environment in Turkey. Students collaborated and interacted with their international counterparts in two different virtual contexts. First, classrooms in the two countries were merged via Skype three times to conduct classroom-to-classroom discussion sessions on Turkish politics. Second, students were paired across locations to work on several assignments. In this paper, our goal is to present how Skype is used in a bi-national context as a blended teaching tool in an upper-level college course for instructors pursuing a similar exercise. In addition to outlining the process with a focus on Skype discussions and one-on-one student projects, we provide actual assignments and discussion questions. Students’ views elicited through surveys administered throughout the semester are presented alongside anecdotal evidence to reflect how the project was received.;2121425221;;;Scholarly Journals;;"Akbaba, Yasemin;Başkan, Filiz";;" Gettysburg College

Measuring Learners’ Attitudes Toward Team Projects: Scale Development Through Exploratory And Confirmatory Factor Analyses;Team projects are increasingly used in engineering courses. Students may develop attitudes toward team projects from prior experience, and their attitudinal responses could influence their performance during team project-based learning in the future. Thus, instructors need to measure students’ attitudes toward team projects during their learner analysis to better understand students’ characteristics and be proactive in providing effective strategies to help students succeed in a team project environment. The purpose of our study was to develop a survey instrument that measures students’ attitudes toward team projects to be used as a learner analysis tool, derived from our local practical needs and due to the lack of appropriate existing instruments. The study was conducted at a mid-sized university in the northwestern United States during 2015-2016. After we generated an initial pool of 50 items, we administered the survey to 225 undergraduate engineering students, performed exploratory factor analysis on the data, and arrived at a four-factor solution of 20 items and a three-factor solution of 14 items. We tested the two competing solutions with another set of 330 undergraduate engineering students. Based on our confirmatory factor analysis results, we arrived at a three-factor model of 12 items as the finalized scale, which measures: (a) professional capacity building, (b) learning and problem-solving skills development, and (c) workload challenges. We call the scale, the Attitudes toward Team Projects Scale on Capacity, Learning, and Workload (ATPS-CLW). Suggestions for future research include continuous development, testing, and validation of the scale.;2050564325;;;Scholarly Journals;;"Seung Youn (Yonnie) Chyung;Winiecki, Donald J;Hunt, Gary;Sevier, Carol M";;;; Copyright The Clute Institute 2017; 10.19030/ajee.v8i2.10065; Journal Article;;; 2017;;2153-2516;2; English; English;; 61-82</pagination>; Littleton;2017;American Journal of Engineering Education;;2017;;;8;https://search.proquest.com/docview/2050564325?accountid=11774;;;;;; 61;;; Students , Learning , Measuring instruments , Discriminant analysis , Engineering education , Attitudes , Workload , Factor analysis , Attitudes , Workloads , Problem solving , Students , Teachers , Colleges & universities; Attitudes Toward Team Projects , Team Project-Based Learning , Exploratory Factor Analysis , Confirmatory Factor Analysis;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aengineeringjournals&amp;atitle=Measuring+Learners%26rsquo%3B+Attitudes+Toward+Team+Projects%3A+Scale+Development+Through+Exploratory+And+Confirmatory+Factor+Analyses&amp;title=American+Journal+of+Engineering+Education&amp;issn=21532516&amp;date=2017-01-01&amp;volume=8&amp;issue=2&amp;spage=61&amp;au=Seung+Youn+%28Yonnie%29+Chyung%3BWiniecki%2C+Donald+J%3BHunt%2C+Gary%3BSevier%2C+Carol+M&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=American+Journal+of+Engineering+Education&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/10.19030%2Fajee.v8i2.10065";ProQuest Central,SciTech Premium Collection

BLENDED PROBLEM-BASED LEARNING IN HIGHER EDUCATION: THE INTERSECTION OF SOCIAL LEARNING AND TECHNOLOGY;In recent years, the discourse regarding the developing and utilization of information related digital technologies has flowed between a notion of autonomous technology and social constructivist perspectives. In higher education, digitized information technologies do not develop in isolation and similarly, the social structures in our classrooms do not develop free from technological influence - there are clear interactions occurring between them but also challenges in how they unfold and operate together. In addition to technological issues for teachers and academic developers who support their professional development, there are problems that arise during the change process from a traditional delivery mechanism, such as the lecture, to an alternative pedagogy such as a problem-based educational model. This paper addresses the need for an analysis of interactions taking place in the blending of online and face-to-face problem-based learning tutorials in the higher education classroom. A desk-based systematic literature review was conducted to gain a deeper understanding of the intersection of social learning and technological relationships of the academic staff who are engaged in professional development in higher education. The main findings of the literature review and experience of designing the blended PBL reveal that an intensive and comprehensive blended PBL staff development program can be effective in transforming teachers' beliefs about teaching and learning with technology. This can emerge from extensive reflection on practice and exposure to appropriate socio-technological models. Further findings show that the benefits of interaction in the blended PBL tutorial are achieved through online and f2f small-group work based on a clear communicative approach and collaborative learning as methods that enhance the learner's autonomy, self-esteem and intrinsic motivation to learn.;1973339801;;;Scholarly Journals; Roisin.Donnelly@dit.ie Learning and Teaching Centre, Dublin Institute of Technology;Donnelly, Roisin;;;; Copyright Addleton Academic Publishers 2017; 10.22381/PIHRM5220172; Journal Article;;; 2017;;2332-399X;2; English; English;; 25-50; Woodside;2017;Psychosociological Issues in Human Resource Management;;2017;;;5;https://search.proquest.com/docview/1973339801?accountid=11774;;;;;; 25;;; Professional development , Online instruction , Higher education , Models , Studies;;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aabiglobal&amp;atitle=BLENDED+PROBLEM-BASED+LEARNING+IN+HIGHER+EDUCATION%3A+THE+INTERSECTION+OF+SOCIAL+LEARNING+AND+TECHNOLOGY&amp;title=Psychosociological+Issues+in+Human+Resource+Management&amp;issn=2332399X&amp;date=2017-01-01&amp;volume=5&amp;issue=2&amp;spage=25&amp;au=Donnelly%2C+Roisin&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=Psychosociological+Issues+in+Human+Resource+Management&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/10.22381%2FPIHRM5220172";ProQuest Central

Improvement of medical content in the curriculum of biomedical engineering based on assessment of students outcomes;Background Improvement of medical content in Biomedical Engineering curricula based on a qualitative assessment process or on a comparison with another high-standard program has been approached by a number of studies. However, the quantitative assessment tools have not been emphasized. The quantitative assessment tools can be more accurate and robust in cases of challenging multidisciplinary fields like that of Biomedical Engineering which includes biomedicine elements mixed with technology aspects. The major limitations of the previous research are the high dependence on surveys or pure qualitative approaches as well as the absence of strong focus on medical outcomes without implicit confusion with the technical ones. The proposed work presents the development and evaluation of an accurate/robust quantitative approach to the improvement of the medical content in the challenging multidisciplinary BME curriculum. Methods The work presents quantitative assessment tools and subsequent improvement of curriculum medical content applied, as example for explanation, to the ABET (Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology, USA) accredited biomedical engineering BME department at Jordan University of Science and Technology. The quantitative results of assessment of curriculum/course, capstone, exit exam, course assessment by student (CAS) as well as of surveys filled by alumni, seniors, employers and training supervisors were, first, mapped to the expected students’ outcomes related to the medical field (SOsM). The collected data were then analyzed and discussed to find curriculum weakness points by tracking shortcomings in every outcome degree of achievement. Finally, actions were taken to fill in the gaps of the curriculum. Actions were also mapped to the students’ medical outcomes (SOsM). Results Weighted averages of obtained quantitative values, mapped to SOsM, indicated accurately the achievement levels of all outcomes as well as the necessary improvements to be performed in curriculum. Mapping the improvements to SOsM also helps in the assessment of the following cycle. Conclusion The suggested assessment tools can be generalized and extended to any other BME department.

Evaluating the Impact of Teaching Methods on Student Motivation;Educational Institutions are consistently looking for ways to prepare students for the competitive workforce. Various methods have been utilized to interpret human differences, such as learning preferences and motivation, in order to make the curriculum more valuable. The objective of this research was to determine the impact of new teaching methods on students' comprehension and knowledge retention within an undergraduate course. New technology and techniques tailored to the student's individual learning preferences were introduced into the course. The teaching methods utilized in the research included: 1) traditional face-to-face lectures, 2) TED-Ed videos, 3) Quizlet, 4) Scoop.It, 5) group project, and 6) homework assignments. The study surveyed students at the beginning and end of a semester to determine the impact on the student's experience. The survey assessed if implementing tools that catered to the student's specific learning preference would have an impact on his/her motivation. An analysis was performed using the Chi-Square test to examine how the student's educational experience improved through the application of the new course tools. The results showed the tools had a positive impact on the student's learning experience. The analysis also suggests that students experienced a change in motivation throughout the semester. This shows that more investigation is required in order to identify causes for the motivational shifts.;1927806854;;;Scholarly Journals; Missouri University of Science and Technology , Missouri University of Science and Technology;"Cudney, Elizabeth A, PhD;Ezzell, Julie M";;;; Copyright Institute for SMET Education and Research Jan/Mar 2017;; Journal Article;;; Jan/Mar 2017;;1557-5276;1; English; English;; 32-49; Auburn;Jan/Mar 2017;Journal of STEM Education : Innovations and Research;;2017;;;18;https://search.proquest.com/docview/1927806854?accountid=11774;;;;;; 32;;; Problem solving , Students , Design of experiments , Manufacturing , Teaching methods , Learning , Curricula , Hypotheses , Education , Statistical tests , Society , Teaching methods , Preferences , Six Sigma , Colleges & universities , Quality , Education , Learning , Independent study , New technology , Engineers , Mechanical engineering , Students;;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aeducation&amp;atitle=Evaluating+the+Impact+of+Teaching+Methods+on+Student+Motivation&amp;title=Journal+of+STEM+Education+%3A+Innovations+and+Research&amp;issn=15575276&amp;date=2017-01-01&amp;volume=18&amp;issue=1&amp;spage=32&amp;au=Cudney%2C+Elizabeth+A%2C+PhD%3BEzzell%2C+Julie+M&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=Journal+of+STEM+Education+%3A+Innovations+and+Research&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/";ProQuest Central,SciTech Premium Collection,Social Science Premium Collection

Flipped Classroom with Problem Based Activities: Exploring Self-regulated Learning in a Programming Language Course;This study intended to explore the development of self-regulation in a flipped classroom setting. Problem based learning activities were carried out in flipped classrooms to promote self-regulation. A total of 30 undergraduate students from Mechatronic department participated in the study. Self-regulation skills were discussed through students’ and the instructor’s experiences including their opinions and behaviours. Qualitative data was collected with an observation form, discussion messages and interviews with selected participants. As a result, in terms of self-regulated learning, the goal setting and planning, task strategies and help seeking skills of the students were high in the face to face learning designed with problem based activities through flipped classroom model, their goal setting and planning, task strategies and help seeking skills were appeared moderately. In the home sessions, environment structuring, goal setting and planning skills were developed in high level while task strategies, help seeking, time management, monitoring, self-efficacy and self-evaluation skills were moderate and monitoring skills was lower. Consequently, it is hoped that the study may provide some suggestions for using problem based activities in flipped learning.;1874036157;;;Scholarly Journals;;"Ünal Çakıroğlu;Öztürk, Mücahit";;;; © 2017.

Dragons, Ladybugs, and Softballs: Girls’ STEM Engagement with Human-Centered Robotics;Early experiences in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) are important for getting youth interested in STEM fields, particularly for girls. Here, we explore how an after-school robotics club can provide informal STEM experiences that inspire students to engage with STEM in the future. Human-centered robotics, with its emphasis on the social aspects of science and technology, may be especially important for bringing girls into the STEM pipeline. Using a problem-based approach, we designed two robotics challenges. We focus here on the more extended second challenge, in which participants were asked to imagine and build a telepresence robot that would allow others to explore their space from a distance. This research follows four girls as they engage with human-centered telepresence robotics design. We constructed case studies of these target participants to explore their different forms of engagement and phases of interest development—considering facets of behavioral, social, cognitive, and conceptual-to-consequential engagement as well as stages of interest ranging from triggered interest to well-developed individual interest. The results demonstrated that opportunities to personalize their robots and feedback from peers and facilitators were important motivators. We found both explicit and vicarious engagement and varied interest phases in our group of four focus participants. This first iteration of our project demonstrated that human-centered robotics is a promising approach to getting girls interested and engaged in STEM practices. As we design future iterations of our robotics club environment, we must consider how to harness multiple forms of leadership and engagement without marginalizing students with different working preferences.;2259576666;;;Scholarly Journals; Indiana University, Bloomington, IN, USA , Indiana University, Bloomington, IN, USA , Indiana University, Bloomington, IN, USA , Indiana University, Bloomington, IN, USA;"Gomoll, Andrea;Hmelo-Silver, Cindy E;Šabanović, Selma;Francisco, Matthew";;;; Journal of Science Education and Technology is a copyright of Springer, (2016).

A project-based learning approach to teaching physics for pre-service elementary school teacher education students;This paper describes the impact of the project-based learning (PBL) approach on learning and teaching physics from the perspective of pre-service elementary school teacher education students and an instructor. This approach promoted meaningful learning (mainly in the scope of projects), higher motivation, and active involvement of students in learning during the entire course. It improved students’ attitudes towards learning physics, reducing fear, and increasing their self-efficacy and enjoyment of learning. This approach developed essential learning and collaborative skills, and strengthened interpersonal and intercultural interactions among all. Implementing PBL raised several challenges: the tension between the quality of learning and the scope of the course content and the necessity to combine a variety of teaching methods to meet students’ learning needs. The paper describes advantages and difficulties from the perspectives of both students and the instructor.;2127123469;;;Scholarly Journals; Research Department, Kaye Academic College of Education, Beer-Sheva, Israel;Goldstein, Olzan;;;; © 2016 The Author(s).

Improving students' critical thinking skills through Remap NHT in biology classroom;Previous studies in Malang, Indonesia showed that there were the failure biology learning caused by not only the low students' prior knowledge, but also biology learning model has not improved the students' critical thinking skills yet, which affected the low of cognitive learning outcomes. The learning model is required to improve students' critical thinking skills. Learning model that considered able to solve this problem is a model that combines reading, constructing concept maps, and the implementation cooperative learning type Numbered Heads Together (Remap NHT) in the classroom. This study was quasi experimental research that compared the effect of Remap NHT learning model and traditional learning in biology classroom to improve critical thinking skills at Xth grade students of senior school in Malang, Indonesia. The results showed that the implementation of Remap NHT during biology classroom showed the effect on students' critical thinking skills.;1955993262;;;Scholarly Journals; Biology Department, Faculty of Mathematic and Natural Science, Universitas Negeri Malang, INDONESIA , Biology Department, Faculty of Mathematic and Natural Science, Universitas Negeri Malang, INDONESIA , Department of Biology, Faculty of Mathematic and Natural Science, Universitas Negeri Makassar, INDONESIA , Biology Department, Faculty of Mathematic and Natural Science, Universitas Negeri Malang, INDONESIA;"Mahanal, Susriyati;Zubaidah, Siti;Bahri, Arsad;Dinnurriya, Maratusy Syahadatud";;;; Copyright The Education University of Hong Kong, Department of Science and Environmental Studies Dec 2016;; Journal Article;;; Dec 2016;;;2; English; English;; 1-19; Hong Kong;Dec 2016;Asia - Pacific Forum on Science Learning and Teaching;;2016;;;17;https://search.proquest.com/docview/1955993262?accountid=11774;;;;;; 1;;; Teaching , Cooperative learning , Students , Classrooms , Collaboration , Problems , Science , Concept mapping , Studies , Knowledge , Biology , 21st century , Metacognition , Humanities , Critical thinking , Cognitive ability , Problem based learning , Education , Reading , Independent study , Cognition & reasoning , Skills , Indonesia;;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aeducation&amp;atitle=Improving+students%27+critical+thinking+skills+through+Remap+NHT+in+biology+classroom&amp;title=Asia+-+Pacific+Forum+on+Science+Learning+and+Teaching&amp;issn=&amp;date=2016-12-01&amp;volume=17&amp;issue=2&amp;spage=1&amp;au=Mahanal%2C+Susriyati%3BZubaidah%2C+Siti%3BBahri%2C+Arsad%3BDinnurriya%2C+Maratusy+Syahadatud&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=Asia+-+Pacific+Forum+on+Science+Learning+and+Teaching&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/";ProQuest Central,Social Science Premium Collection
Analyzing the Social Knowledge Construction and Online Searching Behavior of High School Learners During a Collaborative Problem Solving Learning Activity: a Multi-Dimensional Behavioral Pattern Analysis;  The present study aims to explore the behavioral patterns of the social knowledge construction process and the online searching behaviors in a collaborative problem solving learning activity for high school students, and further compares the different behavioral patterns of the high- and low-performing teams. A total of 78 high school students from two schools participated. This study applied sequential analysis to analyze the students' social knowledge construction and online searching behavior from a large amount of screen-recording data. Interestingly, the results indicate that social interaction that is irrelevant to the discussion task is significantly correlated with academic-related discussion content. Reaching a higher cognitive level of social knowledge construction (e.g., reaching agreement or applying newly constructed meaning) contributes to a successful team project. For online searching behavior, the high-performing teams exhibited systematic online searching behavior and concentrated on the task, while the low-performing teams displayed chaotic searching behavior and were distracted from the task at hand, and seemed to rarely propose their searched results or ideas in their discussions. Based on the results, several possible explanations and suggestions are proposed including the need to promote more adaptive motivation and to provide scaffolding for collaborative skills.;1838506219;;;Scholarly Journals;;"Lin, Che-li;Hou, Huei-tse;Tsai, Chin-chung";;;; De La Salle University 2016; 10.1007/s40299-016-0317-y; Journal Article;;; Dec 2016;;0119-5646;5-6; English; English;; 893-906; Manila;Dec 2016;The Asia - Pacific Education Researcher;;2016;;;25;https://search.proquest.com/docview/1838506219?accountid=11774;;; References;;; 893;;; Collaborative learning , Secondary school students , Online instruction , Searches , Search strategies; Keywords , Sequential analysis , Collaborative synchronous discussion , Social knowledge construction , Online searching behavior;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aeducation&amp;atitle=Analyzing+the+Social+Knowledge+Construction+and+Online+Searching+Behavior+of+High+School+Learners+During+a+Collaborative+Problem+Solving+Learning+Activity%3A+a+Multi-Dimensional+Behavioral+Pattern+Analysis&amp;title=The+Asia+-+Pacific+Education+Researcher&amp;issn=01195646&amp;date=2016-12-01&amp;volume=25&amp;issue=5-6&amp;spage=893&amp;au=Lin%2C+Che-li%3BHou%2C+Huei-tse%3BTsai%2C+Chin-chung&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=The+Asia+-+Pacific+Education+Researcher&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/10.1007%2Fs40299-016-0317-y";ProQuest Central,Social Science Premium Collection
BUILDING A COMMUNITY GARDEN: A COLLABORATIVE CROSS-DISCIPLINARY ACADEMIC COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT PROJECT;"  Most research concerning service learning discusses the benefits students experience when working on a project; however, for faculty, the challenges involved in facilitating the project are also great. We designed a collaborative cross-disciplinary project to address two goals: 1) to increase student engagement through service learning, while also 2) redistributing the work involved in managing the project from the instructor to a second group of upper-level operations management students. Specifically, we used the Academic Community Engagement (ACE) pedagogy, which combines community engagement with academic instruction, in a collaborative project between a freshman-level environmental science class and an upper-level operations management class. The project goal for the students was to research and establish a formal plan for the creation of a community garden in the local town. The community garden project goal was achieved over the course of the semester and survey results suggest that we accomplished both of the cross-disciplinary project goals. Specifically, many of the students developed a deeper sense of connection to the local community and a more tangible idea of how they can serve their communities in the future.";1864516866;;;Scholarly Journals;;"Wozniak, Jeffrey R;Bellah, Jeremy;Riley, Jason M";;;; Copyright Gibson D.

Open data framework for sustainable assessment of project-based learning experiences;Purpose In a project-based learning experience, the detailed monitoring of the activities in which team members participate can be useful to evaluate their work. However, the project activity produces a large amount of data that can be hardly assessed by a single project supervisor. This poses a scalability issue if the number of users or projects size increases. In this vein, the purpose of this paper is to make the assessment of online learning experiences more sustainable. Design/methodology/approach This paper describes a learning-oriented collaborative assessment method, supported by an open data framework. Also, an architecture for the extraction of different indicators to facilitate the assessment process is presented. Findings The assessment method and the open data framework were applied to a project-based course on web engineering. This experience has provided positive evidences because the grade measurement was backed up with assessment evidences and calculated with less effort. Research limitations/implications At the moment, results indicate that apparently there are no significant evidences against the sustainable evaluation practices for students' summative evaluation. Nevertheless, when more data become available, a more statistically significant analysis could be made to determine the influence of the assessment practices in the final result of the evaluated skills. Originality/value In contrast to various existing proposals for e-assessment, the strategy focuses on assessing learning experiences in software development projects. Also, the approach is based on the reuse of information from external process supporting tools by integrating a number of metrics in a non-intrusive way.;1844295245;;;Scholarly Journals;;"Traverso-Ribón, Ignacio;Balderas-Alberico, Antonio;Dodero, Juan-Manuel;Ruiz-Rube, Ivan;Palomo-Duarte, Manuel";;;; © Emerald Group Publishing Limited 2016; 10.1108/PROG-12-2015-0078; Journal Article;;; 2016;;0033-0337;4; English;;; 380-398; Bradford;2016;Program;;2016;;;50;https://search.proquest.com/docview/1844295245?accountid=11774;;;;;; 380;;; Software , Distance learning , Students , Self evaluation , Collaboration , Feedback , Supervisors , Workloads , Linked Data , Open data , Data models , Learning management systems , Quality , Distance learning , Software development , Spain;;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aabiglobal&amp;atitle=Open+data+framework+for+sustainable+assessment+of+project-based+learning+experiences&amp;title=Program&amp;issn=00330337&amp;date=2016-10-01&amp;volume=50&amp;issue=4&amp;spage=380&amp;au=Traverso-Rib%C3%B3n%2C+Ignacio%3BBalderas-Alberico%2C+Antonio%3BDodero%2C+Juan-Manuel%3BRuiz-Rube%2C+Ivan%3BPalomo-Duarte%2C+Manuel&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=Program&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/10.1108%2FPROG-12-2015-0078";ProQuest Central,SciTech Premium Collection,Social Science Premium Collection
Collaborative information seeking in student group projects;Purpose The purpose of this paper is to gain a better understanding of the collaborative information seeking (CIS) behaviors of students conducting authentic group work projects, and the features of a collaborative search system that are most useful to these students. Design/methodology/approach An exploratory study was conducted with 41 participants in ten groups working on an in class, for-credit group project assignment utilizing a collaborative search system. Quantitative and qualitative data were gathered on the everyday search practices of students over the course of the group project, along with quality scores for the sources found. Findings Results showed that student behavior during their CIS related to the quality of their search outcomes, as the effective and efficient searchers found better quality sources. Students’ pre-task attitudes and experiences toward group work also relate to the quality of their search outcomes. Student feedback demonstrated the importance of making collaborative search tools convenient, lightweight, and easy to use. Practical implications These findings may be useful to researchers designing and studying the effectiveness of collaborative search tools, and to instructors planning to incorporate group projects into their classes. Originality/value In this paper, the authors document the authentic behaviors and attitudes of students conducting group projects in an classroom setting, and offer specific recommendations for developers of collaborative search systems.

Video-based learning ecosystem to support active learning: application to an introductory computer science course;"The systematic use of technologies in order to orchestrate learning has become widely used in the past years. Diverse technologies have been applied in a variety of teaching practices; for instance learning tools which allow you to flip the classroom or monitor other active learning practices. However, the developed systems are only a subset of different kinds of learning materials and learning tools that an educator should take into consideration; and most importantly they do not offer an overview of the different learning dynamics. The development of a learning ecosystem framework, which will allow us to describe “the complex of living organisms” as well as their interrelationships, will help us to better understand and further develop our teaching approaches. In this paper, we present a video-based learning ecosystem framework and the first captured results of its application in an introductory computer science course. The framework incorporates basic e-learning tools and traditional learning practices, making it accessible to anyone wanting to implement a video-assisted project-based experience in his/her course. Its application is based on open and easy-to-use tools, allowing for the incorporation of any additional functionalities. This work aims to provide insights for other scholars and practitioners to further validate, examine, and extend the proposed framework. This approach can be used for those interested in incorporating project-based or flipped classroom approaches in their teaching, since it is a flexible procedure that may be adapted to meet their needs.";1987927363;;;Scholarly Journals; Department of Computer and Information Science, Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU), Trondheim, Norway , Department of Computer and Information Science, Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU), Trondheim, Norway , Department of Computer and Information Science, Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU), Trondheim, Norway;"Giannakos, Michail N;Krogstie, John;Aalberg, Trond";;;; Smart Learning Environments is a copyright of Springer, (2016).

Empowering Students to Create Better Virtual Reality Applications: A Longitudinal Study of a VR Capstone Course;In this paper we present our experiences of teaching an annually organized virtual reality (VR) capstone course. We review three iterations of the course, during which a total of 45 students completed the course and 16 VR applications were implemented. Our comparative analysis describes the students' evaluation of the course, the applications created by them, and their development experiences. The results suggest that our gradual improvements on the course and the utilized software paid off, as the latest of the compared course iterations produced the best feedback and the highest quality VR applications. Our learning assessment analysis reveals that our course is effective in teaching VR application development and having students meet their personal learning goals. We also bring forward our RUIS toolkit that was used in the course with success, and present evidence on how better software toolkits can affect the development experience and allow students to create more impressive applications. Finally we share the lessons learned during five years of teaching the course, introducing several practical considerations for VR course organizers regarding pedagogics, software, and hardware.;1862786298;;;Scholarly Journals;;"Takala, Tuukka M;Malmi, Lauri;Pugliese, Roberto;Takala, Tapio";;;; Copyright Institute of Mathematics and Informatics 2016; 10.15388/infedu.2016.15; Journal Article;;; 2016;;1648-5831;2; English; English;; 287-317; Vilnius;2016;Informatics in Education;;2016;;;15;https://search.proquest.com/docview/1862786298?accountid=11774;;;;;; 287;;; Software , Students , Virtual reality , Education , Toolkits , Virtual reality , Students , Correlation analysis;;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aeducation&amp;atitle=Empowering+Students+to+Create+Better+Virtual+Reality+Applications%3A+A+Longitudinal+Study+of+a+VR+Capstone+Course&amp;title=Informatics+in+Education&amp;issn=16485831&amp;date=2016-07-01&amp;volume=15&amp;issue=2&amp;spage=287&amp;au=Takala%2C+Tuukka+M%3BMalmi%2C+Lauri%3BPugliese%2C+Roberto%3BTakala%2C+Tapio&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=Informatics+in+Education&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/10.15388%2Finfedu.2016.15";ProQuest Central,SciTech Premium Collection,Social Science Premium Collection

This study developed a problem-based online learning environment based on constructivist learning design model proposed by Jonassen (1999) and evaluated its effectiveness. It was conducted in the spring 2014 semester with an intention to access to total population that is 1,417 students receiving distance education for Turkish II course at six university vocational schools. The online lesson was implemented in one week, and data were gathered through students' performance tasks and self-evaluation form. The research indicated that the problem-based online learning environment has a positive influence on learning. Moreover, it was revealed that dynamic nature of online environment affected learner's participation in the designed activities and collaboration among students could not be fostered.

Spiral and Project-Based Learning with Peer Assessment in a Computer Science Project Management Course;"Different learning methods such as project-based learning, spiral learning and peer assessment have been implemented in science disciplines with different outcomes. This paper presents a proposal for a project management course in the context of a computer science degree. Our proposal combines three well-known methods: project-based learning, spiral learning and peer assessment. Namely, the course is articulated during a semester through the structured (progressive and incremental) development of a sequence of four projects, whose duration, scope and difficulty of management increase as the student gains theoretical and instrumental knowledge related to planning, monitoring and controlling projects. Moreover, the proposal is complemented using peer assessment. The proposal has already been implemented and validated for the last 3&#xa0;years in two different universities. In the first year, project-based learning and spiral learning methods were combined. Such a combination was also employed in the other 2&#xa0;years; but additionally, students had the opportunity to assess projects developed by university partners and by students of the other university. A total of 154 students have participated in the study. We obtain a gain in the quality of the subsequently projects derived from the spiral project-based learning. Moreover, this gain is significantly bigger when peer assessment is introduced. In addition, high-performance students take advantage of peer assessment from the first moment, whereas the improvement in poor-performance students is delayed.";2259588319;;;Scholarly Journals; Dpto. de Matemáticas y Computación, Universidad de La Rioja, Logroño, Spain , Dpto. de Lenguajes y Sistemas Informáticos, Fac.

Effective Use Of Group Projects In Online Learning;Group projects have long been used in face-to-face instruction to improve cognitive learning among its students. Group projects not only provide practical experience and allow students to practice the concepts they have learned, but also teach the students creative construction and group dynamics. As important as group projects have proven in conventional learning, they are rarely used in online education courses. This paper examines the foundations of effectively using group projects, and then demonstrates how to integrate them into online learning courses;1804900815;;;Scholarly Journals;;Ekblaw, Robert;;" Hudson Valley Community College

Tour Guide Robots: An Integrated Research and Design Platform to Prepare Engineering and Technology Students;  Many interesting research and design questions occur at the intersections of traditional disciplines, yet most coursework and research programs for undergraduate engineering students are focused on one discipline. This leads to underutilization of the potential in better preparing students through multidisciplinary projects. Identifying this opportunity to better prepare the engineering and technology students, this paper presents a multidisciplinary integrated research and design platform on tour guide robots. Through integration of electrical hardware, mechanical systems, design manufacture, and complex programming, the proposed work serves as an ideal platform through which students will be able to study a complex and integrated engineering system. Preliminary implementation of the proposed platform has led to numerous undergraduate research projects, capstone senior design projects, course improvements, publications in peer-reviewed conferences, and best student paper awards.;1812638086;;;Scholarly Journals;;Yelamarthi, Kumar;;;; Copyright Institute for SMET Education and Research Apr-Jun 2016;; Feature;;; Apr-Jun 2016;;1557-5276;2; English; English;; 51-56; Auburn;Apr-Jun 2016;Journal of STEM Education : Innovations and Research;;2016;;;17;https://search.proquest.com/docview/1812638086?accountid=11774;;; Tables , References , Diagrams , Photographs;;; 51;;; Sensors , Design , Curricula , Students , Research , Global positioning systems--GPS , Engineering , Robots , Satellites , Radio frequency identification , Robotics , Blindness , Collaboration , Researchers , Localization , United States--US;;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aeducation&amp;atitle=Tour+Guide+Robots%3A+An+Integrated+Research+and+Design+Platform+to+Prepare+Engineering+and+Technology+Students&amp;title=Journal+of+STEM+Education+%3A+Innovations+and+Research&amp;issn=15575276&amp;date=2016-04-01&amp;volume=17&amp;issue=2&amp;spage=51&amp;au=Yelamarthi%2C+Kumar&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=Journal+of+STEM+Education+%3A+Innovations+and+Research&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/";ProQuest Central,SciTech Premium Collection,Social Science Premium Collection
Using Critical Social Heuristics and Project-Based Learning to Enhance Data Warehousing Education;  The aim of this paper is to demonstrate how project-based learning can be used from a critical systems perspective in data warehousing education. Data warehousing is a discipline in information technology focusing on providing data-driven decision support systems for strategic decision making. In this study we used action research from a critical (emancipative) perspective to reflect on our current instructional design of the data warehousing module before redesigning it to better serve the needs of the involved and affected. We used critical systems heuristics and project-based learning as frameworks of understanding to guide our intervention. Project-based learning is a learning/teaching approach aimed at organising the learning experience in terms of a project. We used written interpretive interviews in the diagnosis and evaluation of success phases of our action research cycle. Our reflection is according to the action research model of Checkland reflecting on our success in the area of application (data warehousing instruction) as well as our methodology (action research from a critical social theory perspective) and our framework of ideas (project-based learning and critical social heuristics).;1771300062;;;Scholarly Journals;;"Taylor, Estelle;Goede, Roelien";;;; Springer Science+Business Media New York 2016; 10.1007/s11213-015-9357-0; Journal Article;;; Apr 2016;;1094-429X;2; English; English;; 97-128; New York;Apr 2016;Systemic Practice and Action Research;;2016;;;29;https://search.proquest.com/docview/1771300062?accountid=11774;;;;;; 97;;;; Critical social heuristics , Project-based learning , Data warehousing education , Critical systems thinking , Action research;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aabiglobal&amp;atitle=Using+Critical+Social+Heuristics+and+Project-Based+Learning+to+Enhance+Data+Warehousing+Education&amp;title=Systemic+Practice+and+Action+Research&amp;issn=1094429X&amp;date=2016-04-01&amp;volume=29&amp;issue=2&amp;spage=97&amp;au=Taylor%2C+Estelle%3BGoede%2C+Roelien&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=Systemic+Practice+and+Action+Research&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/10.1007%2Fs11213-015-9357-0";ProQuest Central
Progress testing: critical analysis and suggested practices;Educators have long lamented the tendency of students to engage in rote memorization in preparation for tests rather than engaging in deep learning where they attempt to gain meaning from their studies. Rote memorization driven by objective exams has been termed a steering effect. Progress testing (PT), in which a comprehensive examination sampling all of medicine is administered repeatedly throughout the entire curriculum, was developed with the stated aim of breaking the steering effect of examinations and of promoting deep learning. PT is an approach historically linked to problem-based learning (PBL) although there is a growing recognition of its applicability more broadly. The purpose of this article is to summarize the salient features of PT drawn from the literature, provide a critical review of these features based upon the same literature and psychometric considerations drawn from the Standards for Educational and Psychological Testing and provide considerations of what should be part of best practices in applying PT from an evidence-based and a psychometric perspective.;2259116551;;;Scholarly Journals; University of Wisconsin-Madison Medical School, National Conference of Bar Examiners, Madison, WI, USA , Ajijic, Jalisco, Mexico;"Albanese, Mark;Case, Susan M";;;; Advances in Health Sciences Education is a copyright of Springer, (2015).

Evaluación sostenible de experiencias de aprendizaje basado en proyectos/Sustainable assessment of learning experiences based on projects;  In a project-based learning experience, the detailed monitoring of the activities in which team members participate can be useful to evaluate their work. Using learning-oriented assessment procedures, supervisors can assess the teamwork abilities with a formative purpose. Evaluation strategies such as self-assessment, peer assessment and co-assessment are often used to make evaluation formative and sustainable. Conducting an assessment strategy is not easy for team members, since they need before to have a reasonable understanding of the evaluation process and criteria. This paper describes a learning-oriented evaluation methodology and an open data framework that can be applied to collaborative project settings. An evaluation rubric and a series of indicators that provide evidences about the developed skills have been elaborated and applied in a small-scale project-based course. Projects were managed and developed with the help of an open source software forge that contains a ticketing tool for planning and tracking of tasks, a version control repository to save the software outcomes, and using a wiki to host text deliverables. The experience provides evidences in favor of using the assessment method and open data framework to make teamwork evaluation more sustainable.;1792366486;;;Scholarly Journals;;"Traverso-Ribón, Ignacio;Balderas-Alberico, Antonio;Dodero, Juan Manuel;Ruiz-Rube, Iván;Palomo-Duarte, Manuel";;;; Copyright Ediciones Universidad de Salamanca Mar 2016; 10.14201/eks2016171943; Feature;;; Mar 2016;;;1; English , Spanish; English;; 19-43; Salamanca;Mar 2016;Education in the Knowledge Society;;2016;;;17;https://search.proquest.com/docview/1792366486?accountid=11774;;; Tables , References , Graphs , Diagrams;;; 19;;; Learning , Projects , Software , Wikis;;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aeducation&amp;atitle=Evaluaci%C3%B3n+sostenible+de+experiencias+de+aprendizaje+basado+en+proyectos%2FSustainable+assessment+of+learning+experiences+based+on+projects&amp;title=Education+in+the+Knowledge+Society&amp;issn=&amp;date=2016-03-01&amp;volume=17&amp;issue=1&amp;spage=19&amp;au=Traverso-Rib%C3%B3n%2C+Ignacio%3BBalderas-Alberico%2C+Antonio%3BDodero%2C+Juan+Manuel%3BRuiz-Rube%2C+Iv%C3%A1n%3BPalomo-Duarte%2C+Manuel&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=Education+in+the+Knowledge+Society&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/10.14201%2Feks2016171943";ProQuest Central,Social Science Premium Collection
Evaluation of Parallel Authentic Research-Based Courses in Human Biology on Student Experiences at Stanford University and the University of Gothenburg;Under a previous grant (2005-08), researchers and teachers at Stanford University (SU) and the University of Gothenburg (GU) co-designed a ten-week interdisciplinary, research-based laboratory course in human biology to be taught online to undergraduate students. Essentials in the subject were taught during the first four weeks of this course. Subsequently, student groups at SU and GU developed their own research questions, conducted live-streamed experiments remotely, processed their unique data with support from multiple interactive resources, cross-cultural collaboration and an interdisciplinary network of expert consultants, and presented original scientific results remotely. Student course-perceptions were evaluated using online questionnaires, scientific logbooks, and observations. In student teams from both universities, the course concept clearly improved student abilities to conduct research using laboratory experiments while learning theoretical basics. A comparison of pre and post course scores from student surveys showed that post course student comfort levels with several research-related tasks increased radically at both universities.

Small Group Learning Methods And Their Effect On Learners’ Relationships;Building relationships in the classroom is an essential part of any teacher's career. Having healthy teacher-to-learner and learner-to-learner relationships is an effective way to help prevent pedagogical failure, social conflict and quarrelsome behavior. Many strategies are available that can be used to achieve good long-lasting relationships in the classroom setting. Successful teachers’ pedagogical work in the classroom requires detailed knowledge of learners’ relationships. Good understanding of the relationships is necessary, especially in the case of teenagers’ class. This sensitive period of adolescence demands attention of all teachers who should deal with the problems of their learners. Special care should be focused on children that are out of their classmates’ interest (so called isolated learners or isolates) in such class and on possibilities to integrate them into the class. Natural idea how to do it is that of using some modern non-traditional teaching/learning methods, especially the methods based on work in small groups involving learners’ cooperation. Small group education (especially problem-based learning, project-based learning, cooperative learning, collaborative learning or inquire-based learning) as one of these methods involves a high degree of interaction. The effectiveness of learning groups is determined by the extent to which the interaction enables members to clarify their own understanding, build upon each other's contributions, sift out meanings, ask and answer questions. An influence of this kind of methods (especially cooperative learning (CL)) on learners’ relationships was a subject of the further described research. Within the small group education, students work with their classmates to solve complex and authentic problems that help develop content knowledge as well as problem-solving, reasoning, communication, and self-assessment skills. The aim of the research was to answer the question: Can the cooperative learning methods help to integrate isolated learners into the class? The research was realized as a pre-test-post-test design for the sample of 207 learners of first, second and third grades of lower secondary school. Standardized sociometric questionnaire B-3 was used to determine the number of isolated learners before and after using the CL methods. Consequently, using the Wilcoxon statistic test of significance, the hypothesis was verified that the number of isolates after the CL methods is statistically significantly lower than that of the case before using the non-traditional teaching/learning method. Accordingly, the research results justify implementation CL methods into education.;2343798478;;;Scholarly Journals;;"Borůvková, R;Emanovský, P";;;; © 2016.

Exploring differences in industry supervisors' ratings of student performance on WIL placements and the relative importance of skills: Does remuneration matter?;Assessment in work integrated learning (WIL) programs typically involves workplace supervisors rating student performance against criteria based on employability skills. Yet investigations of differences in employer ratings that may impact on student outcomes are rare. This study reports on a pilot study that examined supervisor evaluations of the performance of tourism and hospitality management students undertaking a mandatory capstone internship, either paid or non-remunerated. The descriptive and exploratory statistical analysis examines data derived from over one hundred supervisor evaluation forms. A few significant differences in supervisor ratings of performance in paid and unpaid groups and in the relative importance of skills were found. Overall, the study affirmed that supervisors generally rate students highly on all skills. The skills that students are prepared for and assessed on in our WIL program were found to be of high value to local hosts. Implications for debates regarding supervisory input into assessing student performance are explored.;2231188723;;;Scholarly Journals;;"Milne, Lisa;Caldicott, Julia";;;; © 2016.

Crowdsourcing benefits in postgraduate project supervision: Sefako Makgatho Health Sciences University statistics and computer science case study;The paper reports on the findings made on an experiential exercise of Bachelor of Science Honours in Statistics (BSc Hons Stat) in the Department of Statistics and Operations Research (SOR) of the Sefako Makgatho Health Sciences University (SMU) in South Africa. SOR is a small, understaffed department, which offers courses for degrees from Bachelor to Doctoral levels in the subfields of Artificial Intelligence, Data Mining, Operations Research, Statistics and related ones. On SMU campus, expertize in some of these fields is also available in the Department of Computer Science (DCS). In the 2015 academic year SOR admitted 20 BSc Hons Stat students beyond its staffing capacity. Then, SOR invited DCS in a crowdsourcing initiative to jointly supervise student projects in the various subfields mentioned. The challenges include conflict and limited experience. These are managed satisfactorily though, but mainly because they occur at low levels. This crowdsourcing arrangement nevertheless results in timely submissions of final projects, improved quality projects worthy of being published, innovation, quality teamwork, and some synergistic outcomes. Coordinators also learn and/or improved some project management skills;2221317347;;;Scholarly Journals;;"Seeletse, Solly Matshonisa;Tsakani Violet Ndobe;Tichavasia, Alex Dandadzi;Hungwe, Taurai";;;; © 2016.

Collaborative Teamwork in Crossdisciplinarity;"Polytechnique Montréal has integrated an approach of teamwork in its twelve engineering programs, in the bachelor's degree program since 2005. Students must take a compulsory 45 hours course on teamwork and are then accompanied with team coaching throughout the four years program, in all the engineering integration projects. These integration projects are generally ones in which, over a session, the students work in teams to conceive an engineering project. From the creation of a model of a bridge, to the production of a miniature robot, or the design of an industrial product, the projects are as varied as the teams. Within the framework of these projects (1 per year), a group communication specialist meets every team for approximately 60 minutes. This process promotes the transfer of the accumulated knowledge acquired in the teamwork course to their projects and helps identify the group processes at play in their teamwork dynamics. These meetings incite the members of a team to explain their work method, their internal organization, their decision-making process, as well as to give feedback with the objective of finding solutions and taking action. The specialist, during this type of follow-up, acts as a mentor. Along with these meetings is added a service of ""crisis management"" for the teams in difficulty. The specialist attempts, with the team, to define as clearly as possible the dynamic and relational aspects of the problems and they focus on helping the group find a solution for better teamwork. During this type of follow-up, the specialist acts as an advisor. Hence, an experiential approach and a solution-oriented approach used throughout the learning process allow the development of skills in teamwork for the students. The objective pursued by this article is to present an innovative formula used by Polytechnique Montréal and to demonstrate by clear examples how it allows the development of skills in teamwork in all the scientific disciplines. In fact, the experiential approach and the approach oriented to the solutions used at Polytechnique Montréal could be transferred in disciplines as varied as design, computer science, engineering or even ergonomics.";1969015790; EJ1121622;;Scholarly Journals;;Laberge, Renée-Pascale;;;;;; Article , Report , 080: Journal Articles , 141: Reports - Descriptive;;; 2016;;2332-3205;12; English; English;; 2716-2723;;2016;Universal Journal of Educational Research; Scholarly Journals , Reports;2016; http://www.hrpub.org; ERIC, © Horizon Research Publishing;4;https://search.proquest.com/docview/1969015790?accountid=11774;;;;;; 2716;;;  10685ER5 4527ER5 912ER5  10642 4511 909 ,  2236ER5 5901ER5  2225 5882 ,  5385ER5 6603ER5  5368 6582 ,  3488ER5 8290ER5 3164ER5  3474 8260 3150 ,  10282ER5 9179ER5 126ER5  10240 9146 126 ,  6533ER5  6512 ,  2425ER5 153ER5 4413ER5  2414 153 4398 ,  3939ER5 5365ER5 8800ER5  3924 5348 8768 ,  9983ER5 8043ER5 4558ER5  9945 8016 4542 ,  10688ER5 11391ER5 3164ER5  10645 11345 3150 ,  4124ER5 4350ER5  4109 4335 ,  4532ER5 5365ER5 8800ER5  4516 5348 8768 ,  8363ER5 10247ER5 3640ER5 4159ER5  8332 4144 3626 10205 ,  8075ER5 3164ER5  8046 3150 , Canada (Montreal); Postsecondary Education , Canada (Montreal);"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aeric&amp;atitle=Collaborative+Teamwork+in+Crossdisciplinarity&amp;title=Universal+Journal+of+Educational+Research&amp;issn=23323205&amp;date=2016-01-01&amp;volume=4&amp;issue=12&amp;spage=2716&amp;au=Laberge%2C+Ren%C3%A9e-Pascale&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=Universal+Journal+of+Educational+Research&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/EJ1121622&amp;rft_id=info:doi/";Social Science Premium Collection
Knowledge retention in capstone experiences: An analysis of online and face-to-face courses;This research chronicles the development of a capstone experience by a regional comprehensive university. The process began with a multi-year project during which the faculty annually reviewed the results with a view to determining if the class provided the deep learning culminating experiences anticipated. A major measure of success was the desire to replicate the deep learning common in face-to-face classes in the online environment. The results of 166 students were analyzed, 82 online and 84 face-to-face, to determine if a difference existed. A one-way ANOVA tested the score differences among 10 sections and determined the students’ scores did not differ significantly. Finally, a two-sample t-test between proportions determined that there was not a significant difference between the online and face-to-face students with respect to the level of assessment scores earned. Given that online and face-to-face students demonstrate the same level of knowledge, does this beg the question, what value does face-to-face class time offer?;1955087648;;;Scholarly Journals;;"Girard, John P;Yerby, Johnathan;Floyd, Kevin";;;;" (c) 2016 John P Girard, Johnathan Yerby, Kevin Floyd.

"The Evaluation of ""Technological Pedagogical Content Knowledge based Argumentation Practices"" Training for Science Teachers";"  In science education, creating learning environments supported with technology and students' use of theory-evidence coordination when expressing their ideas is emphasized regarding the development of students' scientific reasoning, critical thinking, decision making skills, and etc. In this process, great responsibilities are fallen to teachers as planner and designer of a learning environment. In this study, it is aimed to assess the training which aims the development of science teachers' technological pedagogical content knowledge (TPACK) through argumentation practices. In this context; this study evaluated the science teachers' argumentation skills, self-efficacy perceptions towards TPACK and the teachers' views about the training. 37 science teachers working at different cities in Turkey participated in the one group pre-test post-test experimental training study, which was lasted 54 hours during a week. The training is composed of both hand and minds on argumentation practices based on TPACK. The participants joined different activities such as collaborative group works, drama, modeling, thematic games, art activities, problem-based learning, field trips, observation and workshops. In the study, Argumentation Test, TPACK Self-Efficacy Belief Scale were used as data collection tools. At the end of the training written views of science teachers towards activities were taken. In the light of the findings, this training was effective on the participants' self-efficacy levels towards technological pedagogical content knowledge. Moreover, this training resulted in a positive change in the participants' views about how a statement could be accepted as an argument. However, the increase in scores of argumentation skills was not significant. Additionally almost all of the participants stated that they found the activities useful and can use in their classes. By considering these results, some suggestions were given.";1871595467;;;Scholarly Journals;;"Çoban, Gül Ünal;Akpinar, Ercan;Baran, Bahar;Saglam, Merve Kocagül;Özcan, Erkan;Kahyaoglu, Yasemin";;;; Copyright Turk Egitim Dernegi 2016;; Journal Article;;; 2016;;1300-1337;188; English; English;;; Ankara;2016;Egitim ve Bilim;;2016;;;41;https://search.proquest.com/docview/1871595467?accountid=11774;;;;;; n/a;;;; Technological pedagogical content knowledge , Argumentation , Professional development , Science teachers;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aeducation&amp;atitle=The+Evaluation+of+%22Technological+Pedagogical+Content+Knowledge+based+Argumentation+Practices%22+Training+for+Science+Teachers&amp;title=Egitim+ve+Bilim&amp;issn=13001337&amp;date=2016-01-01&amp;volume=41&amp;issue=188&amp;spage=&amp;au=%C3%87oban%2C+G%C3%BCl+%C3%9Cnal%3BAkpinar%2C+Ercan%3BBaran%2C+Bahar%3BSaglam%2C+Merve+Kocag%C3%BCl%3B%C3%96zcan%2C+Erkan%3BKahyaoglu%2C+Yasemin&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=Egitim+ve+Bilim&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/";ProQuest Central,Social Science Premium Collection

Teachers' Perceptions of the Digital Transformation of the Classroom through the Use of Tablets: A Study in Spain/Percepción docente sobre la transformación digital del aula a través de tabletas: un estudio en el contexto español;"  This study examines the transformation of classroom dynamics brought about by the use of tablets for educational purposes. The empirical bases of this study were defined by the ""Samsung Smart School"" project, which was developed by Samsung and Spain's Ministry of Education during academic year 2014-15, in which teachers and 5th and 6th year students attending 15 primary schools across several Autonomous Communities in Spain were provided with tablets. The research sample comprised 166 teachers. A qualitative analysis strategy was applied by means of: a) non-participant observation, b) focus groups, c) semi-structured interviews with teachers, and d) content analysis of teaching units. These techniques enabled us to extract and examine six dimensions of teaching (educational objective, teaching approach, organization of content and activities, teaching resources, space and time, and learning assessment). Our findings show that teachers tend to apply a transversal approach when using tablets to work on different competencies, focusing more on activities than on content through the use of apps. They reclaim the act of play as part of the learning process, and indicate tablet use encourages project-based learning. To sum up, this study shows that teachers view tablets not only as a technological challenge, but also as an opportunity to rethink their traditional teaching models.";1828141860;;;Scholarly Journals;;"Suárez-Guerrero, Cristóbal;Lloret-Catalá, Carmen;Mengual-Andrés, Santiago";;;; Copyright Grupo Comunicar 2016; 10.3916/C49-2016-08; Feature;;; 2016;;;49; English; English;; 81-89; Huelva;2016;Comunicar;;2016;;;24;https://search.proquest.com/docview/1828141860?accountid=11774;;; Tables , References;;; 81;;; Students , Collaboration , Education , Teachers , Learning , Studies , Teaching methods , Pedagogy , Educational technology , Access to information , Classrooms;;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aeducation&amp;atitle=Teachers%27+Perceptions+of+the+Digital+Transformation+of+the+Classroom+through+the+Use+of+Tablets%3A+A+Study+in+Spain%2FPercepci%C3%B3n+docente+sobre+la+transformaci%C3%B3n+digital+del+aula+a+trav%C3%A9s+de+tabletas%3A+un+estudio+en+el+contexto+espa%C3%B1ol&amp;title=Comunicar&amp;issn=&amp;date=2016-01-01&amp;volume=24&amp;issue=49&amp;spage=81&amp;au=Su%C3%A1rez-Guerrero%2C+Crist%C3%B3bal%3BLloret-Catal%C3%A1%2C+Carmen%3BMengual-Andr%C3%A9s%2C+Santiago&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=Comunicar&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/10.3916%2FC49-2016-08";ProQuest Central,Social Science Premium Collection
Problem-based learning for radiological technologists: a comparison of student attitudes toward plain radiography;"  Background Knowledge and skill expected of healthcare providers continues to increase alongside developments in medicine and healthcare. Problem-based learning (PBL) is therefore increasingly necessary in training courses for radiological technologists. However, it is necessary to evaluate the effects of PBL to completely introduce it in our education programs. As a Hypothesis, it seems that a change occurs in the student's attitudes by participating in PBL practical training. There is the Semantic Differential (SeD) technique as a method to identify student's attitudes. We conceived that PBL could be appropriately evaluated by using SeD technique. In this paper, we evaluated PBL for plain radiography practical training using the SeD technique. Methods Thirty-eight third-year students studying radiological technology participated. PBL was introduced to practical training in plain radiography positioning techniques. Five sessions lasting 5 h each were delivered over a 5-week period during November to December 2012. The clinical scenario was an emergency case with multiple trauma requiring plain radiography. Groups comprising approximately eight students created workflows for trauma radiography with consideration of diagnostic accuracy and patient safety. Furthermore, students groups conducted plain radiography on a patient phantom according to created workflows and were then guided by feedback from professional radiologists. All students answered SeD questionnaires to assess views on plain radiography before instruction to provide preliminary practical training reports and after completing practical training. Results The factors were identified using factor analysis of the questionnaires, which were answered before and after each practical training session. On evaluation of the relationships between factors and question items according to factor loading, we identified ""reluctance"", ""confidence"", and ""exhaustion"" as the predominant attitudes before practical training. Similarly, we identified ""expectation"", ""self-efficacy"", and ""realness"" as the predominant attitudes after practical training. The attitudes toward plain radiography changed before and after PBL practical training. Conclusions The attitude of self-efficacy was noted after practical training, which incorporated PBL. Student self-efficacy was thought to increase through self-directed learning, which is one of the aims of PBL. Although the influences of other lectures and training, which were performed in parallel with the PBL practice training, were not completely excluded, and although the number of study participants was small, we were able to confirm the effects of PBL.";1825039772;;;Scholarly Journals;;"Terashita, Takayoshi;Tamura, Naomi;Kisa, Kengo;Kawabata, Hidenobu;Ogasawara, Katsuhiko";;;; Copyright BioMed Central 2016; 10.1186/s12909-016-0753-7; Journal Article;;; 2016;;;; English; English;; n/a; London;2016;BMC Medical Education;;2016;;;16;https://search.proquest.com/docview/1825039772?accountid=11774;;;;;; n/a;;; Health education; Problem-based learning , Student's attitude , Semantic differential technique , Factor analysis , Radiological technologist , Plain radiography practical training , Self-efficacy;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aeducation&amp;atitle=Problem-based+learning+for+radiological+technologists%3A+a+comparison+of+student+attitudes+toward+plain+radiography&amp;title=BMC+Medical+Education&amp;issn=&amp;date=2016-01-01&amp;volume=16&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Terashita%2C+Takayoshi%3BTamura%2C+Naomi%3BKisa%2C+Kengo%3BKawabata%2C+Hidenobu%3BOgasawara%2C+Katsuhiko&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=BMC+Medical+Education&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/10.1186%2Fs12909-016-0753-7";ProQuest Central,Social Science Premium Collection
ENHANCING STUDENTS' SELF-EFFICACY, ELABORATION, AND CRITICAL THINKING SKILLS IN A COLLABORATIVE EDUCATOR PREPARATION PROGRAM;  In the learner-centered learning environment, students can connect and engage with their peers and with the real world easily. The purpose of this study was to examine the relationships of online students' perceptions of learner-centered approach, motivated strategies for learning, and critical thinking skills. Participants were 15 graduate students enrolled in 2 online courses. The students reported the online courses they were taking utilized learner-centered instructions. Moreover, the results revealed that students reported increased mean scores on learner-centered approach (M = 3.89, SD = .44) and on all three motivated strategies for learning (self-efficacy, elaboration, and critical thinking) after completing all course activities. On average, students scored 24.84 out of 28 possible points on their critical thinking skills from the assessment of the assigned project. In addition, the results also revealed that learner-centered approach was positively correlated with all three motivated strategies for learning and was significantly correlated with elaboration learning strategy (r = .55). The highest correlation was found between elaboration and critical thinking learning strategies (r = .69). The results of this study also indicated that online students who have higher perceptions of learner-centered approach are more likely to have higher motivated strategies for learning, especially critical thinking skills.;1822035929;;;Scholarly Journals;;"Tseng, Hungwei;Gardner, Teresa;Yeh, Hsin-Te";;;; Copyright Information Age Publishing 2016;; Feature;;; 2016;;1528-3518;2; English; English;; 15-28,61,63; Charlotte;2016;Quarterly Review of Distance Education;;2016;;;17;https://search.proquest.com/docview/1822035929?accountid=11774;;; References;;; 15;;; Distance learning , Online instruction , Students , School environment , Teaching , Studies , Motivation , Problem solving , Critical thinking , Knowledge , Independent study , Classrooms , Collaborative learning , Problem based learning , 21st century;;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aeducation&amp;atitle=ENHANCING+STUDENTS%27+SELF-EFFICACY%2C+ELABORATION%2C+AND+CRITICAL+THINKING+SKILLS+IN+A+COLLABORATIVE+EDUCATOR+PREPARATION+PROGRAM&amp;title=Quarterly+Review+of+Distance+Education&amp;issn=15283518&amp;date=2016-01-01&amp;volume=17&amp;issue=2&amp;spage=15&amp;au=Tseng%2C+Hungwei%3BGardner%2C+Teresa%3BYeh%2C+Hsin-Te&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=Quarterly+Review+of+Distance+Education&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/";ProQuest Central,Social Science Premium Collection
Benefits and challenges of introducing a blended project-based approach in higher education: Experiences from a Kenyan university;  This article investigates a blended project-based approach that was introduced to forestry and ICT undergraduates as an extracurricular activity at the University of Eldoret, Kenya. The approach blends problem-based learning and participatory design to solve real-life forestry problems. Even though the use of the approach itself is not novel, in this article, we explore its introduction as an extracurricular activity at a university that currently follows a more traditional teaching paradigm. Using a multiple case study, the study explores the project implementation activities and student experiences in order to identify the benefits gained and challenges faced. The findings show that the used blended project-based approach results in solutions that are more contextually relevant and also equips the participating students with technical, interdisciplinary and interpersonal skills that are essential to entering the workplace which they may otherwise have not acquired from their curricula.;1821083695;;;Scholarly Journals;;"Munezero, Myriam D;Bekuta, Balozi K";;;; Copyright University of the West Indies 2016;; Feature;;; 2016;;;2; English; English;; 206-218; Bridgetown;2016;International Journal of Education and Development using Information and Communication Technology;;2016;;;12;https://search.proquest.com/docview/1821083695?accountid=11774;;; Photographs , References;;; 206;;; Extracurricular activities , Problems , Higher education , Students , Research , Teaching , Core curriculum , Internet access , Studies , Community , Pedagogy , Problem based learning , Kenya;;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aeducation&amp;atitle=Benefits+and+challenges+of+introducing+a+blended+project-based+approach+in+higher+education%3A+Experiences+from+a+Kenyan+university&amp;title=International+Journal+of+Education+and+Development+using+Information+and+Communication+Technology&amp;issn=&amp;date=2016-01-01&amp;volume=12&amp;issue=2&amp;spage=206&amp;au=Munezero%2C+Myriam+D%3BBekuta%2C+Balozi+K&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=International+Journal+of+Education+and+Development+using+Information+and+Communication+Technology&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/";ProQuest Central,Social Science Premium Collection

Introducing Project-Based Instruction in the Saudi ESP Classroom: A Study in Qassim University;The aim of this paper is to study the impact of introducing an integrative pedagogical approach in the ESP classes on developing the English language vocabulary of Computer Science and Information Technology students in the College of Science, Qassim University. The study suggests a framework for an ESP course-design employing students' project work based on the analysis of learners' needs. The researchers made use of the experimental pre-test post-test control group design where the English vocabulary test was used as a pre and post test. The results reported from this study revealed the effectiveness of the suggested project-based ESP course on developing the English vocabulary for the target subjects. Also, the results show that project based instruction enhanced the teaching and learning of ESP and developed new study habits for learners by promoting self-directed, independent, cooperative learning as well as out-of-classroom learning. The study concluded with recommendations related to how projects can be incorporated into ESP classrooms to develop different language skills i.e. speaking, listening, reading, and writing.;1773227871; EJ1087117;;Scholarly Journals;;"Alsamani, Abdul-Aziz Saleh;Daif-Allah, Ayman Sabry";;;;;; Article , Report , 080: Journal Articles , 143: Reports - Research;;; 2016;;1916-4742;1; English; English;; 51-64;;2016;English Language Teaching; Scholarly Journals , Reports;2016; http://www.ccsenet.org/journal/index.php/elt; ERIC, © Canadian Center of Science and Education;9;https://search.proquest.com/docview/1773227871?accountid=11774;;;;;; 51;;;  10282ER5 9179ER5 126ER5  10240 9146 126 ,  10664ER5 3241ER5 6603ER5  10621 3227 6582 ,  3501ER5 3495ER5 9442ER5 5765ER5 3494ER5 5095ER5 5821ER5 5822ER5  3487 3481 9408 5746 3480 5078 5802 5803 ,  2218ER5 8884ER5 6603ER5 4558ER5  2207 4542 8852 6582 ,  9438ER5 5901ER5  9404 5882 ,  9437ER5 4936ER5 5259ER5  9403 4919 5242 ,  10330ER5 918ER5  10287 915 ,  8195ER5 10833ER5 6468ER5  8166 10789 6447 ,  5811ER5 9726ER5 1ER5  5792 9690 1 ,  1815ER5 10321ER5 8043ER5 4558ER5  1806 10278 8016 4542 ,  11178ER5 1823ER5 9339ER5 5258ER5  11134 1814 9306 5241 ,  11373ER5 2799ER5  11327 2787 ,  2065ER5 5172ER5 8290ER5 3164ER5  2054 5155 8260 3150 ,  3282ER5 10713ER5  3268 10669 ,  2236ER5 5901ER5  2225 5882 ,  4124ER5 4350ER5  4109 4335 ,  7023ER5 3640ER5  6997 3626 ,  8566ER5 6468ER5  8535 6447 ,  6894ER5 7254ER5 10833ER5 6468ER5  6869 7228 10789 6447 ,  10685ER5 4527ER5 912ER5  10642 4511 909 ,  8263ER5 1719ER5  8233 1710 ,  10125ER5 2586ER5 3643ER5 6603ER5  10087 2574 3629 6582 , Saudi Arabia; Higher Education , Postsecondary Education , Saudi Arabia;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aeric&amp;atitle=Introducing+Project-Based+Instruction+in+the+Saudi+ESP+Classroom%3A+A+Study+in+Qassim+University&amp;title=English+Language+Teaching&amp;issn=19164742&amp;date=2016-01-01&amp;volume=9&amp;issue=1&amp;spage=51&amp;au=Alsamani%2C+Abdul-Aziz+Saleh%3BDaif-Allah%2C+Ayman+Sabry&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=English+Language+Teaching&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/EJ1087117&amp;rft_id=info:doi/";Social Science Premium Collection
Team-Based Building of a Remotely Operated Underwater Robot, an Innovative Method of Teaching Engineering;  This article reports the experience gathered along 6 years in developing a team-based project activity to promote engineering programs among secondary school students. The aim of the activity is to increase the interest of students for science and technology in general, but also to promote engineering skills, capabilities and values, leading to attract more secondary school students to enrolment for engineering programs. Simple theoretical concepts related to physics and engineering are illustrated through hands-on experimentation. To achieve this goal, the students build a remotely operated underwater robot in a workshop. The robot is built using low-cost materials and the students customize their own design over the different phases of the workshop. Once the activity is completed, every team understands that with teamwork, effort and a good working strategy, every problem can be overcome.;1750299761;;;Scholarly Journals;;"El-fakdi, Andres;Cufí, Xavier;Hurtós, Natàlia;Correa, Montserrat";;;; Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht 2016; 10.1007/s10846-015-0203-5; Journal Article;;; Jan 2016;;0921-0296;1; English; English;; 51-61; Dordrecht;Jan 2016;Journal of Intelligent & Robotic Systems;;2016;;;81;https://search.proquest.com/docview/1750299761?accountid=11774;;;;;; 51;;;; Increasing interest for engineering , Hands-on experimentation , Project-based learning , Underwater Robots.;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aengineeringjournals&amp;atitle=Team-Based+Building+of+a+Remotely+Operated+Underwater+Robot%2C+an+Innovative+Method+of+Teaching+Engineering&amp;title=Journal+of+Intelligent+%26+Robotic+Systems&amp;issn=09210296&amp;date=2016-01-01&amp;volume=81&amp;issue=1&amp;spage=51&amp;au=El-fakdi%2C+Andres%3BCuf%C3%AD%2C+Xavier%3BHurt%C3%B3s%2C+Nat%C3%A0lia%3BCorrea%2C+Montserrat&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=Journal+of+Intelligent+%26+Robotic+Systems&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/10.1007%2Fs10846-015-0203-5";ProQuest Central,SciTech Premium Collection
Managing Software Engineering Student Teams Using Pellerin's 4-D System;  In this article, we discuss the use of Pellerin's Four Dimension Leadership System (4-D) as a way to manage teams in a classroom setting. Over a 5-year period, we used a modified version of the 4-D model to manage teams within a senior level Software Engineering capstone course. We found that this approach for team management in a classroom setting led to qualitatively fewer incidents of teams unable to effectively work together, better projects, and greater group cohesion. In this article, we discuss our experience using the 4-D System, which was not originally designed for use in the classroom. We find our modified version of the 4-D System to be viable in a classroom setting and provide the reader with everything needed to implement 4-D in his or her own course.;1822073830;;;Scholarly Journals;;"Doman, Marguerite;Besmer, Andrew;Olsen, Anne";;" National Aeronautics & Space Administration--NASA

Collaboration, intragroup conflict, and social skills in project-based learning;  This case study was conducted in two high school classrooms that utilized collaborative project-based learning (PBL). Collaboration is an important instructional strategy, especially used in conjunction with PBL, and is an essential learning outcome for the twenty-first century. This study examined how collaboration can be achieved as a learning outcome and used effectively as an instructional method by understanding what causes task-, process-, and relationship-related intragroup conflict and how social skills are related to intragroup conflict and collaboration at both the individual and group levels. Literature suggests that, while task-related conflict serves as a catalyst for collaboration, process- and relationship-related conflicts are detrimental to collaboration and impede learning. Social interdependence theory suggests that social skills play an important role in enhancing collaboration and resolving conflicts. Data were collected through online questionnaires and follow-up interviews. Interview data were analyzed using a qualitative data analysis approach. The survey data were analyzed using multi-level structural equation modeling, which allowed us to reveal an interesting relationship between group-level social skills and collaboration. Results suggest that different individual difference factors triggered each type of conflict, and most of the groups experienced more than one type of conflict simultaneously. Task and process conflicts were often transformed into relationship conflict, when social skills were lacking. Interestingly, group-level social skills were more influential than individual members' social skills in reducing intragroup conflict and enhancing collaboration.;1703138332;;;Scholarly Journals;;"Lee, Dabae;Huh, Yeol;Reigeluth, Charles M"; INLSBJ;;; Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht 2015; 10.1007/s11251-015-9348-7; Feature;;; Sep 2015;;0020-4277;5; English; English;; 561-590; Dordrecht;Sep 2015;Instructional Science;;2015;;;43;https://search.proquest.com/docview/1703138332?accountid=11774;;; References;;; 561;;; Group dynamics , Social skills , Collaborative learning; Collaboration , Intragroup conflict , Social skills , Individual differences , Social interdependence theory;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aeducation&amp;atitle=Collaboration%2C+intragroup+conflict%2C+and+social+skills+in+project-based+learning&amp;title=Instructional+Science&amp;issn=00204277&amp;date=2015-09-01&amp;volume=43&amp;issue=5&amp;spage=561&amp;au=Lee%2C+Dabae%3BHuh%2C+Yeol%3BReigeluth%2C+Charles+M&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=Instructional+Science&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/10.1007%2Fs11251-015-9348-7";ProQuest Central,Social Science Premium Collection
Development of capstone project attitude scales;"  This study attempted to develop valid and reliable Capstone Project Attitude Scales (CPAS). Among the scales reviewed, the Modified Fennema-Shermann Mathematics Attitude Scales was adapted in the construction of the CPAS. Usefulness, Confidence, and Gender View were the three subscales of the CPAS. Four hundred sixty-three students answered the questionnaire. The validity of the scales was ensured through pilot testing and factor analysis with a threshold value of at least 0.50. Meanwhile, the reliability of the items was determined through Cronbach's alpha analysis. All items with Cronbach's alpha value of less than 0.70 were discarded. It was shown that Usefulness, Confidence, and Gender View had Cronbach's alpha values of 0.837, 0.748, and 0.818, respectively. Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was utilized to confirm the model and discriminant validity was used to find out if each of the constructs was unique in itself. It was also revealed that the measurement model of the revised scales provided a good fit (CFI=0.97; AGFI=0.94; RMSEA=0.038) and the constructs were distinct from one another.

How to Transform Language Education for Next Generation Learners: A Path to Follow in Higher Education in the 21st Century;"  With the changing face of education, technology is a powerful asset for the 21st century teachers and students if pedagogy is considered as the major concern rather than technology itself. Technology seems very attractive to teachers and students, but it is good to keep in mind that it is not just games and applications. We must see not only it as fun, but also its functional power on learning, teaching and assessing. As teachers change the way they teach due to new technologies, the traditional pedagogy is replaced by student-centered and project-based learning and teaching. This can provide a deeper understanding and learning, and greater student success. Therefore, an effective next generation teaching needs to meet the 21st century expectations. Schools and teachers must be well-equipped with new genres and resources so that they can enhance the necessary skills and attitudes of students; creative and critical thinking, team work and collaboration, digital literacy and others. In order to do this, schools and teachers must change the way they regard teaching in many ways, individually or along with professional aid and development. This paper is a descriptive one which aims to raise awareness in the changing face of education. Its purpose is to assist schools of foreign language administrators and teachers whose target audience is Next Generation Learners (NGL). It highlights some of their generalized characteristics and interests so that schools and teachers regard this paper as a reference guide. Also, the paper provides some specific strategies and models as examples for schools and teachers to enhance effective teaching and learning environments for Next Generation Learners.";1764087724;;;Scholarly Journals;;Munzur, Zeynep;;;; Copyright Nesibe Aydin Education Institutions 2015;; Feature;;; 2015;;2146-8249;8; English; English;; 47-66; Ankara;2015;Journal of Education and Future;;2015;;;;https://search.proquest.com/docview/1764087724?accountid=11774;;; References , Diagrams;;; 47;;; Colleges & universities , Students , Teaching methods , Digital literacy;;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aeducation&amp;atitle=How+to+Transform+Language+Education+for+Next+Generation+Learners%3A+A+Path+to+Follow+in+Higher+Education+in+the+21st+Century&amp;title=Journal+of+Education+and+Future&amp;issn=21468249&amp;date=2015-07-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=8&amp;spage=47&amp;au=Munzur%2C+Zeynep&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=Journal+of+Education+and+Future&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/";ProQuest Central,Social Science Premium Collection
INCORPORATING SOFTWARE MAINTENANCE IN A SENIOR CAPSTONE PROJECT;  Software engineering capstone projects give students experience in developing a software product throughout the software life cycle. Projects such as these give students practical experience in applying concepts they have learned in their software engineering and computer science classes. This paper presents a software engineering capstone project conducted by students at the University of Virginia's College at Wise. The work of the students is documented in this paper. Unlike previous capstone projects conducted at this university, this one uses methods commonly found in agile development and is an adaptive maintenance development effort.;1689386463;;;Scholarly Journals;;"Weissberger, Ira;Qureshi, Abrar;Chowhan, Assad;Collins, Ethan;Gallimore, Dakota";;;; Copyright Academy of Taiwan Information Systems Research Jun 2015;; Feature;;; Jun 2015;;1995-6649;1; English; English;; 31-38; Taipei;Jun 2015;International Journal of Cyber Society and Education;;2015;;;8;https://search.proquest.com/docview/1689386463?accountid=11774;;; Tables , References;;; 31;;;;;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Acompscijour&amp;atitle=INCORPORATING+SOFTWARE+MAINTENANCE+IN+A+SENIOR+CAPSTONE+PROJECT&amp;title=International+Journal+of+Cyber+Society+and+Education&amp;issn=19956649&amp;date=2015-06-01&amp;volume=8&amp;issue=1&amp;spage=31&amp;au=Weissberger%2C+Ira%3BQureshi%2C+Abrar%3BChowhan%2C+Assad%3BCollins%2C+Ethan%3BGallimore%2C+Dakota&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=International+Journal+of+Cyber+Society+and+Education&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/";ProQuest Central,SciTech Premium Collection
Scaffolding argumentation about water quality: a mixed-method study in a rural middle school;  A common way for students to develop scientific argumentation abilities is through argumentation about socioscientific issues, defined as scientific problems with social, ethical, and moral aspects. Computer-based scaffolding can support students in this process. In this mixed method study, we examined the use and impact of computer based scaffolding to support middle school students' creation of evidence-based arguments during a 3-week problem-based learning unit focused on the water quality of a local river. We found a significant and substantial impact on the argument evaluation ability of lower-achieving students, and preliminary evidence of an impact on argument evaluation ability among low-SES students. We also found that students used the various available support--computer-based scaffolding, teacher scaffolding, and groupmate support--in different ways to counter differing challenges. We then formulated changes to the scaffolds on the basis of research results.;1678714960;;;Scholarly Journals;;"Belland, Brian R;Gu, Jiangyue;Armbrust, Sara;Cook, Brant";;;; Association for Educational Communications and Technology 2015; 10.1007/s11423-015-9373-x; Feature;;; Jun 2015;;1042-1629;3; English; English;; 325-353; New York;Jun 2015;Educational Technology, Research and Development;;2015;;;63;https://search.proquest.com/docview/1678714960?accountid=11774;;; References;;; 325;;; Water quality , Studies , Rural areas , Middle schools;;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Apsychology&amp;atitle=Scaffolding+argumentation+about+water+quality%3A+a+mixed-method+study+in+a+rural+middle+school&amp;title=Educational+Technology%2C+Research+and+Development&amp;issn=10421629&amp;date=2015-06-01&amp;volume=63&amp;issue=3&amp;spage=325&amp;au=Belland%2C+Brian+R%3BGu%2C+Jiangyue%3BArmbrust%2C+Sara%3BCook%2C+Brant&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=Educational+Technology%2C+Research+and+Development&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/10.1007%2Fs11423-015-9373-x";ProQuest Central,Social Science Premium Collection
A course on serious game design and development using an online problem-based learning approach;Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to describe a novel undergraduate course on serious game design and development that integrates both game and instructional design, thus providing an effective approach to teaching serious game design and development. Very little effort has been dedicated to the teaching of proper serious game design and development leading to many examples of serious games that provide little, if any, educational value. Design/methodology/approach – Organized around a collection of video clips (that provided a brief contextualized overview of the topic and questions for further exploration), readings, interdisciplinary research projects and games, the course introduced the principles of game and instructional design, educational theories used to support game-based learning and methods for evaluating serious games. Discussions and activities supported the problems that students worked on throughout the course to develop a critical stance and approach toward implementing game-based learning. Students designed serious games and examined potential issues and complexities involved in developing serious games and incorporating them within a teaching curriculum. Findings – Results of student course evaluations reveal that the course was fun and engaging. Students found the course fun and engaging, and through the successful completion of the final course project, all students met all of the course objectives. A discussion regarding the techniques and approaches used in the course that were successful (or unsuccessful) is provided. Research limitations/implications – It should be noted that a more detailed analysis has not been presented to fully demonstrate the effectiveness of the course. A more detailed analysis may have included a comparison with, for example, past versions of the course that was not based on an online problem-based learning (PBL) approach, to better quantify the effectiveness of the course. However, such a comparison could not be carried out here, given there was no measure of prior knowledge of students taken before they took course (e.g. no “pre-test data”). Originality/value – Unlike the few existing courses dedicated to serious game design, the course was designed specifically to facilitate a fully online PBL approach and provided students the opportunity to take control of their own learning through active research, exploration and problem-solving alone, in groups and through facilitated class discussions.;2093343591;;;Scholarly Journals; Faculty of Business and Information Technology, University of Ontario Institute of Technology, Oshawa, Canada , Faculty of Education, York University, Toronto, Canada , Faculty of Education, University of Ontario Institute of Technology, Oshawa, Canada , Faculty of Education, University of Ontario Institute of Technology, Oshawa, Canada;"Kapralos, Bill;Fisher, Stephanie;Clarkson, Jessica;Roland van Oostveen";;;; © Emerald Group Publishing Limited 2015; 10.1108/ITSE-10-2014-0033; Case Study;;; 2015;;1741-5659;2; English; English;; 116-136; Bingley;2015;Interactive Technology and Smart Education;;2015;;;12;https://search.proquest.com/docview/2093343591?accountid=11774;;;;;; 116;;; Research , Simulation , Students , Computer & video games , Teaching methods , Intercultural communication , Exploration , Electronic & video games , Education , Instructional design , Interdisciplinary aspects , Teaching methods , Curricula , Distance learning , Interdisciplinary studies , Systematic review , Learning , Research projects , Problem solving , Students , Skills , Designers; Instructional design , Undergraduates , Problem-based learning , Simulation , Online , Teaching methods , Distance learning , Video games , Serious games , Game design;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=unknown&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aeducation&amp;atitle=A+course+on+serious+game+design+and+development+using+an+online+problem-based+learning+approach&amp;title=Interactive+Technology+and+Smart+Education&amp;issn=17415659&amp;date=2015-04-01&amp;volume=12&amp;issue=2&amp;spage=116&amp;au=Kapralos%2C+Bill%3BFisher%2C+Stephanie%3BClarkson%2C+Jessica%3BRoland+van+Oostveen&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=Interactive+Technology+and+Smart+Education&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/10.1108%2FITSE-10-2014-0033";ProQuest Central,SciTech Premium Collection,Social Science Premium Collection
Interprofessional Problem-Based Learning Project Outcomes Between Prelicensure Baccalaureate of Science in Nursing and Doctor of Pharmacy Programs;"  Persistently high medical error rates, caregiver dissatisfaction, and compromised patient safety often result from poorly coordinated, increasingly complex health care. Barriers to interprofessional health professions education persist despite the urgent calls for improved quality and safety. Investigators explored the effects of a problem-based learning (PBL) strategy between prelicensure doctorate of pharmacy (PharmD) and baccalaureate nursing (BSN) students. A descriptive design was used to compare the learning gains and satisfaction with a PBL hybrid approach for BSN and PharmD prelicensure student groups over three academic terms. Consistent with earlier works, content-based learning gains and student satisfaction were not significantly different between groups. Narrative data provide insight into perceived benefits, barriers, and perspectives of participating students and facilitators. Attributes of this pedagogical approach provide opportunity for prelicensure students to explore professional interdependence while adequately mastering fact-based content.

A Blended Professional Development Program to Help a Teacher Learn to Provide One-to-One Scaffolding;"  Argumentation is central to instruction centered on socio-scientific issues (Sadler &amp; Donnelly in International Journal of Science Education, 28(12), 1463-1488, 2006. doi:10.1080/09500690600708717). Teachers can play a big role in helping students engage in argumentation and solve authentic scientific problems. To do so, they need to learn one-to-one scaffolding--dynamic support to help students accomplish tasks that they could not complete unaided. This study explores a middle school science teacher's provision of one-to-one scaffolding during a problem-based learning unit, in which students argued about how to optimize the water quality of their local river. The blended professional development program incorporated three 1.5-h seminars, one 8-h workshop, and 4 weeks of online education activities. Data sources were video of three small groups per period, and what students typed in response to prompts from computer-based argumentation scaffolds. Results indicated that the teacher provided one-to-one scaffolding on a par with inquiry-oriented teachers described in the literature.";1661012984;;;Scholarly Journals;;"Belland, Brian R;Burdo, Ryan;Gu, Jiangyue";;;; The Association for Science Teacher Education, USA 2015; 10.1007/s10972-015-9419-2; Feature;;; Apr 2015;;1046-560X;3; English; English;; 263-289; Abingdon;Apr 2015;Journal of Science Teacher Education;;2015;;;26;https://search.proquest.com/docview/1661012984?accountid=11774;;; References;;; 263;;; Professional development , Science teachers , Science education , Online instruction;;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aeducation&amp;atitle=A+Blended+Professional+Development+Program+to+Help+a+Teacher+Learn+to+Provide+One-to-One+Scaffolding&amp;title=Journal+of+Science+Teacher+Education&amp;issn=1046560X&amp;date=2015-04-01&amp;volume=26&amp;issue=3&amp;spage=263&amp;au=Belland%2C+Brian+R%3BBurdo%2C+Ryan%3BGu%2C+Jiangyue&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=Journal+of+Science+Teacher+Education&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/10.1007%2Fs10972-015-9419-2";ProQuest Central,Social Science Premium Collection
Virtual Teaming and Digital Learning Strategies: Preparing Students for a Global Workplace;  Many organizations use technology and social media as the cost-effective, even the preferred, rapid communication and teaming modality. University students must consequently be more than just Facebook ready to meet the greater business needs. They must possess fluency in the selection and use of computer mediated communication and virtual teaming applications. The paper examines the changing role of technology in teaching group principles, concepts, and theories to students competing in the global/virtual realities of teaming and group projects. The contribution presents a comprehensive online/on-ground (i.e., hybrid or blended) course design that accelerates team and group theory beyond the traditional live team application. The paper describes how students taking a teams class fully explored the variety of ever-expanding computer mediated communication platforms. They used action-learning labs to test and apply the use of a variety of face-to-face, computer mediated communication, and a blend of the two learning platforms to complete group assignments and discover the application of group theory as it relates to group project planning, group development, and conflict resolution.;1700641553;;;Scholarly Journals;;"Andert, Darlene;Alexakis, George";;;; Copyright Multimedia Educational Resource for Learning and Online Teaching (MERLOT) Mar 2015;; Journal Article , Feature;;; Mar 2015;;;1; English; English;; n/a;  Long Beach;Mar 2015;Journal of Online Learning and Teaching;;2015;;;11;https://search.proquest.com/docview/1700641553?accountid=11774;;; References;;; 146;;; Virtualization , Online instruction , Computer mediated communication , Virtual teams; Virtual interaction design , online group work , virtual group work , virtual team building , differentiated learning , computer-mediated communications;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aeducation&amp;atitle=Virtual+Teaming+and+Digital+Learning+Strategies%3A+Preparing+Students+for+a+Global+Workplace&amp;title=Journal+of+Online+Learning+and+Teaching&amp;issn=&amp;date=2015-03-01&amp;volume=11&amp;issue=1&amp;spage=146&amp;au=Andert%2C+Darlene%3BAlexakis%2C+George&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=Journal+of+Online+Learning+and+Teaching&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/";ProQuest Central,Social Science Premium Collection
"Selecting teams: The potential of ""the Grid""";  This paper investigates the use of a Computer-Based Team Selection Algorithm (CBTSA) in a capstone project course involving Information Systems, Human Resources, and Supply Chain/Operations undergraduate students. Data from three semesters of the course before this genetic algorithm was put into use are compared to data from three semesters after it was adopted. More than 50 % of the teams formed by the CBTSA were able to meet in part or in whole at times arranged by the CBTSA. Students in the CBTSA-formed teams experienced considerably less general time, procrastination and motivation problems, or specific scheduling conflicts. The percentage of students reporting that the team had to change its meeting schedule to accommodate them dropped to zero percent for the CBTSA-formed teams. Fewer CBTSA-formed teams seemed to break down with one or more low performing members. However, 42 % of the CBTSA-formed teams were created such that there were few really open meeting slots for every member. Some improvements to the genetic algorithm used in the CBTSA are investigated, but regardless of improvements, it is difficult to provide every team with rich meeting times and still achieve parity for the teams on a number of other criteria.;1655163766;;;Scholarly Journals;;Mchenry, William K;;;; Springer Science+Business Media New York 2015; 10.1007/s10639-013-9274-8; Feature;;; Mar 2015;;1360-2357;1; English; English;; 183-199; New York;Mar 2015;Education and Information Technologies;;2015;;;20;https://search.proquest.com/docview/1655163766?accountid=11774;;;;;; 183;;; Algorithms , Computer simulation , Teamwork , Business education;;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aeducation&amp;atitle=Selecting+teams%3A+The+potential+of+%22the+Grid%22&amp;title=Education+and+Information+Technologies&amp;issn=13602357&amp;date=2015-03-01&amp;volume=20&amp;issue=1&amp;spage=183&amp;au=Mchenry%2C+William+K&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=Education+and+Information+Technologies&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/10.1007%2Fs10639-013-9274-8";ProQuest Central,Social Science Premium Collection
Embedded Systems for the Internet of Things In Product Design Education;  The objective of this work identified whether there is a need to incorporate the Internet of Things (IoT) into the product design curriculum at the Loughborough Design School. Initial research into the subject area comprised an extensive literature review into the origins, growth, challenges and enabling technologies for the IoT. Furthermore, this work explored literature around IoT within the current curriculum and for product designers and graduates, however. Whilst this work considers the possibilities and capabilities through various visions and methods of application, the fundamentals of the technical side are considered in order to understand these possibilities for the IoT as a subject. A mixed-method research approach was design which used a structured questionnaire survey for product design students and interviews with design lecturers. The results revealed a majority agreement into the need and interest for the Loughborough Design School to incorporate IoT subject matter, however, with much debate (Ruhini, 2012) and discussion into how this may be envisioned. The work conclude with implementation through a mixed approach between basic technical teaching of microcontroller design applications combined with project-led problem based learning allowing students to combine their design skills into product concepts and prototypes in order to realise and develop the future Internet of Things.

Problem-Based Learning And Its Effect On Learners’ Relationships;Detailed knowledge of learners’ relationships is very important for successful teacher pedagogical work in a classroom. The familiarity with the relationships is important, especially in the case of teenagers’ class. All teachers should deal with the problem of learners that are out of their classmates’ interest (so called isolated learners or isolates) in such class and think about possibilities to integrate them into the class. Natural idea how to do it is that of using some non-traditional learning methods, especially the methods based on working in small groups involving learners’ cooperation. Problem-based learning (PBL) as one of these methods with an influence on learners’ relationships was a subject of the further described research. Within PBL courses, students work with classmates to solve complex and authentic problems that help develop content knowledge as well as problem-solving, reasoning, communication, and self-assessment skills. The aim of the research was to answer the question: Can the problem-based learning help to integrate isolated learners into the class? The research was realized as a pretest-posttest design for the sample of 182 learners of seventh, eighth and ninth grades of basic school. Standardized sociometric questionnaire B-3 was used to determine the number of isolated learners before and after using the problem-based learning. Consequently, using the Wilcoxon statistic test of significance, the hypothesis was verified that the number of isolates after the problem-based learning is statistically significantly lower than that of the case before using the non-traditional learning method. Accordingly, the research results justify implementation PBL into education.;2344380957;;;Scholarly Journals;;Emanovský, P;;;; © 2015.

"Communication In Stem Education: A Non-Intrusive Method For Assessment &amp;amp; K20 Educator Feedback";The current push to educate highly qualified and productive Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) professionals typically culminates in collegiate capstone projects. These group projects attempt to prepare STEM professionals for entry into the real world as they exemplify early career group dynamics and expose the reality that communication and other soft-skills are often just as important as technical skills. Since attitudes of STEM students and early career professions are established throughout the entire K-20 curriculum, this article also provides some feedback to educators. The research presented utilized, a free cloud based collaboration tool to observe the communication habits of three senior capstone teams (n= 13 participants) and was able to predict communication success and failures through straight-forward analysis of several key parameters, including: discussion frequency, number of responses and the distribution of work over time.;2343799540;;;Scholarly Journals;;Borowczak, M;;;; © 2015.

Evaluation Of Students’ General Perceptions Of Problem-Based Learning In A Computer Engineering Program In Brazil;This research aimed to evaluate students’ overall perceptions of Problem-based Learning use in a Computer Engineering program in Brazil. PBL is applied to nine interdisciplinary core courses of its curriculum. A 32-item questionnaire was administered to 115 students, with an average age of 20.9 (SD 2.7) between late 2014 and the beginning of 2015. It includes items on PBL general aspects, improved skills, PBL room and overall satisfaction. The results show that students’ degree of agreement with several items ranged from 4.1 to 5.9, in a seven-point scale. Some of these items revealed that 68.7% of the students got familiarized with PBL along the first year and there is a growing tendency among students to improve this familiarity with PBL over time. Moreover, the two items with lowest degree of disagreement were tutors’ feedback at the end of each tutorial session (35.7%) and the deadline to elaborate these solutions of problems (29.6%). Almost all students also agree with that PBL helps them to improve several skills, mainly problem-solving, self-directed learning and critical thinking. Repeating students in PBL courses scored higher than the non-repeating students. Many of them were statistically significant differences, inclusive for items on familiarization process. This can mean that their failures are not related to the familiarity with the method likely. Finally, most of the students are satisfied with PBL and like it, what indicates a successful use of it in the mentioned program.;2343797537;;;Scholarly Journals;;"dos Santos, D. M.

Effects of Problem-Based Learning on Academic Achievement: A Meta-Analysis Study;  Today there is need for individuals who solve problems, who argue, question, change and take the lead and who use information instead of accumulating it. This need reveals the value of problem-based learning approach (PBL) which provides students to work in groups on a scenario prepared for the particular topic. Independent studies, aiming to determine PBL's impact on achievement when compared to traditional teaching, often focus on a particular type of application or operation. In the relevant literature, there are many studies on different educational fields, different lectures and different student groups concerning PBL's effects on achievement when compared to traditional teaching. This has lead to the need for meta-analysis of these studies. Therefore, this study aims to combine findings of independent studies through meta-analysis method. This integration is expected to contribute literature. In the study, studies, which can be meta-analysed with regard to predefined criteria, were examined and 98 studies fulfilling these criteria were identified. Effect size and combined effects sizes were calculated with the help of the Comprehensive Meta Analysis v2.0 (CMA) Statistical Packet program. The results of the study are the following: (1) The average effect sizes of studies included in meta-analysis done in line with random effects model is calculated as 0.83. This finding showed that according to traditional teaching, PBL's effects on academic achievement are high. (2) According to the analyses done in order to reveal publication bias, it was found that meta-analysis study has no publication bias. (3) It was found that PBL approach affects the studies teachers and master's students the most and affects faculty members studies the least. (4) It was found that sample size of the PBL's groups, big or small, has no significant impact on student achievement. (5) It was identified that PBL's effects on student achievement when compared to traditional teaching has not changed according to field of sciences PBL was applied. (6) There is no difference between the academic achievements of different educational levels where PBL was applied. (7) PBL's effects on academic achievement, does not depend on the approach's application time in the teaching-learning process. In addition to its research findings, this study includes descriptive analysis results of studies that were included in meta-analysis.;1735636625;;;Scholarly Journals;;"Dagyar, Miray;Demirel, Melek";;;; Copyright Turk Egitim Dernegi 2015;; Feature;;; 2015;;1300-1337;181; English; English;; n/a; Ankara;2015;Egitim ve Bilim;;2015;;;40;https://search.proquest.com/docview/1735636625?accountid=11774;;; References;;; n/a;;; Academic achievement , Meta-analysis , Learning , Problem solving; Problem-Based Learning , Traditional Teaching , Academic Achievement , Meta-Analysis Method;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aeducation&amp;atitle=Effects+of+Problem-Based+Learning+on+Academic+Achievement%3A+A+Meta-Analysis+Study&amp;title=Egitim+ve+Bilim&amp;issn=13001337&amp;date=2015-01-01&amp;volume=40&amp;issue=181&amp;spage=&amp;au=Dagyar%2C+Miray%3BDemirel%2C+Melek&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=Egitim+ve+Bilim&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/";ProQuest Central,Social Science Premium Collection
CONSTRUCT VALIDATION OF STUDENT ATTITUDE TOWARD SCIENCE, TECHNOLOGY, ENGINEERING, AND MATHEMATICS PROJECT-BASED LEARNING: The Case of Korean Middle Grade Students;"  The purpose of this study was to examine student attitudes toward science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) project-based learning (PBL). To guarantee the impact of STEM PBL on academic achievement, it is important to understand student attitudes toward STEM PBL. The initial survey consisted of 51 items, which were created by the authors and adapted/adjusted from previous studies. Exploratory factor analysis and confirmatory factor analysis were employed to examine the psychometric properties of the instrument, specifically reliability and validity for student attitudes toward STEM PBL. As a result, 5 factors and 25 items were extracted. The 5 factors were ""self regulated learning,"" ""collaborative learning environment,"" ""interdisciplinary learning environment,"" ""technology-based learning,"" and ""hands-on activity."" Using the developed instrument, 785 Korean middle grade students were surveyed and showed a positive attitude toward five factors of STEM PBL. Given the valid and reliable (0.766-0.861) scores in this study, the developed survey might be used in investigating student attitude toward STEM PBL in other areas. However, others should examine the English translation for its psychometric properties before using it for research. In addition, educators might refer to the information on student attitude toward STEM PBL in designing STEM integrated lessons.";1660316585;;;Scholarly Journals;;"Han, SunYoung;Carpenter, Daniel";;;; Copyright Information Age Publishing Winter 2014;; Feature;;; Winter 2014;;1937-0814;3; English; English;; 27-41; Charlotte;Winter 2014;Middle Grades Research Journal;;2014;;;9;https://search.proquest.com/docview/1660316585?accountid=11774;;; Tables , References , Diagrams;;; 27;;; Studies , Teaching methods , Academic achievement , School environment , Behavior , Learning , Perceptions , Student attitudes , Cognitive style , Technology education , Science education , Educational technology , Mathematics education , STEM education;;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aeducation&amp;atitle=CONSTRUCT+VALIDATION+OF+STUDENT+ATTITUDE+TOWARD+SCIENCE%2C+TECHNOLOGY%2C+ENGINEERING%2C+AND+MATHEMATICS+PROJECT-BASED+LEARNING%3A+The+Case+of+Korean+Middle+Grade+Students&amp;title=Middle+Grades+Research+Journal&amp;issn=19370814&amp;date=2014-12-01&amp;volume=9&amp;issue=3&amp;spage=27&amp;au=Han%2C+SunYoung%3BCarpenter%2C+Daniel&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=Middle+Grades+Research+Journal&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/";ProQuest Central,SciTech Premium Collection,Social Science Premium Collection
Creation of audiovisual presentations as a tool to develop key competences in secondary-school students. A case study in science class.;"  New curricular plans based on key competences create the need for new educational proposals that allow their development. This article describes a proposal to develop key competences through project-based learning. The project's objective is the creation of a digital video. The following study was carried out with students in their final two years of non-mandatory secondary-school, in the subject of ""Physics and Chemistry"". The students created didactic documentary videos describing different aspects of kinematics. The planning of the project focused on to involve the students in all steps of the process, in order to be able to evaluate the competences developed during each part of the project. The results showed an important improvement in both the digital and science competences. It was also shown that the necessary stages to create an audiovisual presentation involve the use of the competences related to communication, personal initiative or learning to learn; this provides an opportunity for the student to develop said capacities.";1647669750;;;Scholarly Journals;;"Ezquerra, Ángel;Manso, Javier;Burgos, Ma Esther;Hallabrin, Carla";;" Organization for Economic Cooperation & Development

Enhanced and conventional project-based learning in an engineering design module;"  Engineering education focuses chiefly on students' ability to solve problems. While most engineering students are proficient in solving paper questions, they may not be proficient at providing optimal solutions to pragmatic project-based problems that require systematic learning strategy, innovation, problem-solving, and execution. The present study aims to determine whether an enhanced Project-based learning (PBL) with appropriate innovative interventions leads to increased students' ability to achieve better learning and project outcomes. The interventions refer to incorporating added learning and facilitating methods, namely, (1) use of mind-maps; (2) employment of analogies; and (3) use of round-table discussions. The study was conducted with a total number of 60 first-time PBL students equally divided into two classes with one serving as an experimental class and another as a control class. In addition, one class of students had a lower academic standing compared to the other (control). The rubric for the project-based module included a written knowledge test and a scenario-based oral examination to test knowledge and problem-solving skills, a artefact demonstration to evaluate artefact's performance. A major finding of this study was that there were significant differences in knowledge scores, problem-solving ability and artefact performance between students undergoing conventional and enhanced PBL methods. It could also be inferred from this study that students who had undergone enhanced PBL method designed better systems and had better performing artefacts than those who were subjected to the conventional PBL approach. Finally, it was concluded that incorporating enhanced learning and facilitating methods to group-centric, project-based driven education provided a more fertile environment to promote better learning experience and improved problem-solving ability which could eventually lead to developing innovative and pragmatic solutions to real-world engineering problems.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]";1614610749;;;Scholarly Journals;;"Chua, K J;Yang, W M;Leo, H L";;;; Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht 2014; 10.1007/s10798-013-9255-7; Feature;;; Nov 2014;;0957-7572;4; English; English;; 437-458; Dordrecht;Nov 2014;International Journal of Technology and Design Education;;2014;;;24;https://search.proquest.com/docview/1614610749?accountid=11774;;;;;; 437;;; Design engineering , Education , Learning;;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aeducation&amp;atitle=Enhanced+and+conventional+project-based+learning+in+an+engineering+design+module&amp;title=International+Journal+of+Technology+and+Design+Education&amp;issn=09577572&amp;date=2014-11-01&amp;volume=24&amp;issue=4&amp;spage=437&amp;au=Chua%2C+K+J%3BYang%2C+W+M%3BLeo%2C+H+L&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=International+Journal+of+Technology+and+Design+Education&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/10.1007%2Fs10798-013-9255-7";Art, Design & Architecture Collection,ProQuest Central,SciTech Premium Collection,Social Science Premium Collection
Using wikis for online group projects: Student and tutor perspectives;  This paper presents a study of the use of wikis to support online group projects in two courses at the UK Open University. The research aimed to investigate the effectiveness of a wiki in supporting (i) student collaboration and (ii) tutors' marking of the students' collaborative work. The paper uses the main factors previously identified by the technology acceptance model (TAM) as a starting point to examine and discuss the experiences of these two very different user groups: students and tutors. Data was gathered from students via a survey and from tutors via a range of methods. The findings suggest that, when used in tandem with an online forum, the wiki was a valuable tool for groups of students developing a shared resource. As previous studies using the TAM have shown, usefulness and ease of use were both important to students' acceptance of the wiki. However, the use of a wiki in this context was less well-received by tutors, because it led to an increase in their workload in assessing the quality of students' collaborative processes. It was possible to reduce the tutor workload by introducing a greater degree of structure in the students' tasks. We conclude that when introducing collaborative technologies to support assessed group projects, the perceptions and needs of both students and tutors should be carefully considered.;1634290322;;;Scholarly Journals;;"Kear, Karen;Donelan, Helen;Williams, Judith";;;; Copyright International Review of Research in Open and Distance Learning Sep 2014;; Journal Article;;; Sep 2014;;;4; English; English;;; Athabasca;Sep 2014;International Review of Research in Open and Distance Learning;;2014;;;15;https://search.proquest.com/docview/1634290322?accountid=11774;;;;;; n/a;;; Online instruction , Distance learning , Research , Studies , Collaboration; Wikis , collaboration , online learning , group projects , technology acceptance model;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aeducation&amp;atitle=Using+wikis+for+online+group+projects%3A+Student+and+tutor+perspectives&amp;title=International+Review+of+Research+in+Open+and+Distance+Learning&amp;issn=&amp;date=2014-09-01&amp;volume=15&amp;issue=4&amp;spage=&amp;au=Kear%2C+Karen%3BDonelan%2C+Helen%3BWilliams%2C+Judith&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=International+Review+of+Research+in+Open+and+Distance+Learning&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/";ProQuest Central,Social Science Premium Collection
Building an Undergraduate STEM Team Using Team-Based Learning Leading to the Production of a Storyboard Appropriate for Elementary Students;"A unique undergraduate team that spans five different engineering disciplines, chemistry, biology, and mathematics was formed. The team was formed to promote cross-disciplinary learning, to improve retention, and to prepare the students for the kind of problems they will face in their careers. This paper describes the variety of activities used over 2&#xa0;years to tie the team together, as well as afford opportunities to develop team-building skills. The activities described highlight the critical elements of a faculty leader whose own work is interdisciplinary, correct balance of disciplines in the team, and sufficient time for team development. The use of external feedback was essential for all activities. Clearly defined goals and hard deadlines were critical for the completion of individual activities, as well as developing a healthy team environment. Although the student cohort has learned from the activities, more time is needed to assess whether the students have become a fully efficient team. Furthermore, an additional cohort would be needed to assess whether the approach was able to assist with student’s interest in STEM and their desire to help other people.";2259587454;;;Scholarly Journals; Department of Civil Engineering, The University of Akron, Akron, OH, USA , Department of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering, The University of Akron, Akron, OH, USA , Integrated Biosciences Program, Department of Biology, The University of Akron, Akron, OH, USA;"Cutright, Teresa J;Evans, Edward;Brantner, Justin S";;;; Journal of Science Education and Technology is a copyright of Springer, (2013).

Chinese Business English Students' Epistemological Beliefs, Self-Regulated Strategies, and Collaboration in Project-Based Learning;  This study aimed to investigate the nature of epistemological beliefs, conceptions of collaboration, and strategy use in Project-based Learning among Chinese business English students and to explore the relations among epistemological beliefs, collaboration, strategy use, and academic performance. 25 year-three students in a Sino-British joint English for International Business program in Mainland China were interviewed about their project learning experiences. Qualitative analysis of the interview data identified patterns of their reported beliefs, conceptions of collaboration, and strategy use. Quantitative analysis revealed significant correlations among beliefs and strategy use as well as with project performance. This study extended earlier research by characterizing different levels of epistemological beliefs and identifying special patterns of conceptions of collaboration and strategy use associated with Project-based Learning in a different cultural context. Findings also problematized the generally held assumption that students from a collectivist culture would naturally know how to collaborate. These findings would have important educational implications for designing and promoting Project-based Learning for college business English students in Asian educational contexts.;1655718292;;;Scholarly Journals;;"Zhao, Ke;Zheng, Yongyan";;;; De La Salle University 2014; 10.1007/s40299-013-0103-z; Feature;;; Jun 2014;;0119-5646;2; English; English;; 273-286; Manila;Jun 2014;The Asia - Pacific Education Researcher;;2014;;;23;https://search.proquest.com/docview/1655718292?accountid=11774;;; References;;; 273;;; Epistemology , Business schools , Collaborative learning , Educational psychology , College students;;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aeducation&amp;atitle=Chinese+Business+English+Students%27+Epistemological+Beliefs%2C+Self-Regulated+Strategies%2C+and+Collaboration+in+Project-Based+Learning&amp;title=The+Asia+-+Pacific+Education+Researcher&amp;issn=01195646&amp;date=2014-06-01&amp;volume=23&amp;issue=2&amp;spage=273&amp;au=Zhao%2C+Ke%3BZheng%2C+Yongyan&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=The+Asia+-+Pacific+Education+Researcher&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/10.1007%2Fs40299-013-0103-z";ProQuest Central,Social Science Premium Collection
Convergence of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) Tools in Project Based Learning (PBL);  Rapid technological advancement influences the communication and information management as well as knowledge construction. Within the context of new challenges, lifelong learning emerges a fundamental element for the constant development of professionals. So that it dynamically adapts to change and retain a state-of-the-art identity. At present, Computer Science Education, Information and Communication Technology (ICT) are becoming one of the most important elements which are defining the basic competencies of students. Information technology integrates medial, informative and computer science education, but also all the educational subjects mentioned in the curriculum basis of general education. In Science education, there is an increasing concept of integrated teaching, which shows the students, the world in a holistic manner. The principle of universal activity of students in cognitive, emotional and motivation, as well as in practical sphere is preferred. More and more often attention is paid to the fact that the contemporary problem is not so much lack of information, as its surplus and crowd of information as well as its unnecessary excess of details may be an effective tool of disinformation. Hence it forms such skills with students as selection, evaluation and organizing of information and forming its structure seems to be justified. So that, they can serve the drawing conclusion. In this article, the author has briefly outlined and taking into account the various manners of didactic transformation of teaching contents. Selected ICT tools have been presented in the light of teaching principles and cognitive activities model.;1558098340;;;Scholarly Journals;;Ismail Thamarasseri;;;; Copyright iManager Publications Jun-Aug 2014;; Feature;;; Jun-Aug 2014;;0973-2217;1; English; English;; 1-7; Nagercoil;Jun-Aug 2014;i-Manager's Journal on School Educational Technology;;2014;;;10;https://search.proquest.com/docview/1558098340?accountid=11774;;; References;;; 1;;; Educational technology , Science education , Cognitive style; Project Based Learning (PBL) , Information and Communication Technology (ICT) , Convergence;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aindianjournals&amp;atitle=Convergence+of+Information+and+Communication+Technology+%28ICT%29+Tools+in+Project+Based+Learning+%28PBL%29&amp;title=i-Manager%27s+Journal+on+School+Educational+Technology&amp;issn=09732217&amp;date=2014-06-01&amp;volume=10&amp;issue=1&amp;spage=1&amp;au=Ismail+Thamarasseri&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=i-Manager%27s+Journal+on+School+Educational+Technology&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/";ProQuest Central
Interdisciplinary Project Experiences: Collaboration between Majors and Non-Majors;Students in computer science and information technology should be engaged in solving real-world problems received from government and industry as well as those that expose them to various areas of application. In this paper, we discuss interdisciplinary project experiences between majors and non-majors that offered a creative and innovative opportunity for collaborative learning. Active-learning exercises allowed students to express their creativity and apply concepts learned from each discipline. Feedback from this effort resulted in the development of the Seven C's (Competencies) for collaborative learning that were ascertained for successful completion of an interdisciplinary project. We feel that these interdisciplinary and collaborative efforts increased student appreciation, enhanced team skills, and created a positive learning environment for the application of concepts.;1913345833; EJ1140732;;Scholarly Journals;;"Smarkusky, Debra L.;Toman, Sharon A.";;;;;; Article , Report , 080: Journal Articles , 141: Reports - Descriptive; 1545-679X;; May 2014;;;3; English; English;; 67-75;;May 2014;Information Systems Education Journal; Scholarly Journals , Reports;2014; http://isedj.org; ERIC, © Information Systems and Computing Academic Professionals;12;https://search.proquest.com/docview/1913345833?accountid=11774;;;;;; 67;;;  5385ER5 6603ER5  5368 6582 ,  2236ER5 5901ER5  2225 5882 ,  10282ER5 9179ER5 126ER5  10240 9146 126 ,  2065ER5 5172ER5 8290ER5 3164ER5  2054 5155 8260 3150 ,  5185ER5 10713ER5  5168 10669 ,  8263ER5 1719ER5  8233 1710 ,  11139ER5 1815ER5 10321ER5 8043ER5 4558ER5  11095 1806 10278 8016 4542 ,  6276ER5 10321ER5 8043ER5 4558ER5  6256 10278 8016 4542 ,  7140ER5 10321ER5 8043ER5 4558ER5  7114 10278 8016 4542 ,  124ER5 5901ER5  124 5882 ,  2399ER5 8440ER5 5068ER5  2388 8409 5051 ,  3939ER5 5365ER5 8800ER5  3924 5348 8768 ,  1983ER5 3164ER5  1972 3150 ,  5899ER5  5880 ,  10685ER5 4527ER5 912ER5  10642 4511 909 ,  6934ER5 3164ER5  6909 3150 ,  10219ER5 732ER5  10181 730 ,  10303ER5 10423ER5 3643ER5 6603ER5  10260 10380 3629 6582 ,  6085ER5 730ER5 6468ER5 8635ER5  6066 728 6447 8603 ,  8359ER5 2064ER5 5171ER5 9385ER5 5983ER5  8328 2053 5154 9351 5964 , Pennsylvania; Higher Education , Postsecondary Education , Pennsylvania;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aeric&amp;atitle=Interdisciplinary+Project+Experiences%3A+Collaboration+between+Majors+and+Non-Majors&amp;title=Information+Systems+Education+Journal&amp;issn=1545-679X&amp;date=2014-05-01&amp;volume=12&amp;issue=3&amp;spage=67&amp;au=Smarkusky%2C+Debra+L.%3BToman%2C+Sharon+A.&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=Information+Systems+Education+Journal&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/EJ1140732&amp;rft_id=info:doi/";Social Science Premium Collection
Promoting proper education for sustainability: An exploratory study of ICT enhanced Problem Based Learning in a developing country;  One of the goals of education is to create responsible citizens who can adequately understand the problems faced by their societies and who can then act to help solve them. Such behaviour can be fostered through proper education that facilitates expert knowledge about social issues, nurtures the ability to think critically and learns the skills needed to pro-actively search for possible solutions. Through this study we aimed to develop an Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) supported pedagogical framework, Children as Agents of Social Change (CASC), as a possible vehicle to facilitate appropriate education about social issues. This article analyses the first implementation of the CASC framework carried out at schools in Tanzania. Forest fires in Tanzania are often caused by human activity and education about this pressing problem needs to be provisioned on a large scale. However, due to a lack of teachers and teacher expertise, this is not the reality. With help of the local community, we created a locally contextualised video supported by a Problem Based Learning (PBL) solution to connect local forest experts with school students. These students then creatively conducted PBL activities in order to help solve local environmental and conservation problems. Data was collected through preand post-tests of control-experimental groups and teacher interviews. Results suggest that the participants were enlightened as to a variety of active problem solving possibilities and that they ranked the CASC methodology as an effective approach to sustainability.;1533431079;;;Scholarly Journals;;"Roy, Amit;Kihoza, Patrick;Suhonen, Jarkko;Vesisenaho, Mikko;Tukiaianen, Markku";;" United Nations Educational Scientific & Cultural Organization

Flipping the Statistics Classroom in Nursing Education;"  Flipped classrooms are so named because they substitute the traditional lecture that commonly encompasses the entire class period with active learning techniques, such as small-group work. The lectures are delivered instead by using an alternative mode--video recordings--that are made available for viewing online outside the class period. Due to this inverted approach, students are engaged with the course material during the class period, rather than participating only passively. This flipped approach is gaining popularity in many areas of education due to its enhancement of student learning and represents an opportunity for utilization by instructors of statistics courses in nursing education. This article presents the author's recent experiences with flipping a statistics course for nursing students in a PhD program, including practical considerations and student outcomes and reaction. This transformative experience deepened the level of student learning in a way that may not have occurred using a traditional format.

Pre-test Data and Lessons Learned from a Group Research Project Examining Changes in Physical Activity Behavior Following Construction of a Rails-to-Trails Facility;"  Built environments in rural settings may provide greater challenges than those in urban settings due to physical characteristics inherent to low-density population areas. Multiuse recreational trails, such as those that repurpose abandoned railroad lines, may provide a physical activity resource that is well suited to rural areas. However, the direct impact of trail availability on physical activity behavior is not generally known because it is unclear whether activity reported in most trail research represents increases in physical activity or displacement of activity in individuals who previously exercised in other locations. This research, initiated by a group of students in a graduate seminar, represents to our knowledge, the first instance in which PA was assessed prior to the availability of an entirely new rails-to-trails facility. The research was implemented using a nonequivalent dependent variable design to counter the lack of a control group; the nonequivalent dependent variable chosen was weekly servings of fruit and vegetables. Participants responding to intercept interviews classified days of activity during the prior week as mild, moderate or vigorous. Baseline results for 244 participants suggested generally low levels of activity prior to trail availability; number of reported days of activity decreased with described intensity. We also discuss several issues encountered in planning and implementing this group project including those related to data collection, variable levels of commitment among student members, and inconsistent project management, and offer potential solutions to these concerns.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]";1503218045; 24162856;;Scholarly Journals;;"Chatfield, Sheryl L;Mumaw, Elizabeth;Davis, T;Hallam, Jeffrey S"; JCMHBR;;; Springer Science+Business Media New York 2014; 10.1007/s10900-013-9775-9; Feature , Journal Article;;; Apr 2014;;0094-5145;2; English; English;; 386-93; New York;Apr 2014;Journal of Community Health;;2014;;;39;https://search.proquest.com/docview/1503218045?accountid=11774;;;;;; 386;; Adult , Female , Humans , Male , Middle Aged , Recreation , Rural Population; Group dynamics , Research , Physical fitness , Behavior , Construction , Railway networks;;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Apsychology&amp;atitle=Pre-test+Data+and+Lessons+Learned+from+a+Group+Research+Project+Examining+Changes+in+Physical+Activity+Behavior+Following+Construction+of+a+Rails-to-Trails+Facility&amp;title=Journal+of+Community+Health&amp;issn=00945145&amp;date=2014-04-01&amp;volume=39&amp;issue=2&amp;spage=386&amp;au=Chatfield%2C+Sheryl+L%3BMumaw%2C+Elizabeth%3BDavis%2C+T%3BHallam%2C+Jeffrey+S&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=Journal+of+Community+Health&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/24162856&amp;rft_id=info:doi/10.1007%2Fs10900-013-9775-9";ProQuest Central,SciTech Premium Collection,Social Science Premium Collection
Towards designing cognitively-enriched project-oriented courses within a blended problem-based learning context;  Traditional education seems to gradually and moderately make way for self-directed and student-centred learning strategies that will efficiently enable students to reach their full potentials and will sufficiently prepare them for their upcoming professional careers. Problem-Based Learning (PBL) is such a strategy, since it enables active participation by shifting the focus from the delivery of knowledge to its creation by the students, in their endeavour to implement problem-based projects. PBL is more commonly used in project-oriented courses, where students have to not only build but also apply new knowledge in real world contexts and therefore familiarize themselves with work conditions. Online technologies, such as cognitive tools, are able to harmonize this shift by visualizing some of the more demanding steps of PBL as well as facilitating collaboration and knowledge building. The aim of this paper is to investigate the incorporation of cognitive technologies in project-oriented courses, using a Blended PBL strategy. To this end, we implement our findings in a Project Management postgraduate course. Based on the gathered results, we propose a framework that can guide the design of project-oriented courses and we argue that its adaptation can exploit the identified strengths and avoid the weaknesses and lead to successful and immersive learning processes.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT];1495433835;;;Scholarly Journals;;"Tambouris, Efthimios;Zotou, Maria;Tarabanis, Konstantinos";;;; Springer Science+Business Media New York 2014; 10.1007/s10639-012-9209-9; Feature;;; Mar 2014;;1360-2357;1; English; English;; 61-86; New York;Mar 2014;Education and Information Technologies;;2014;;;19;https://search.proquest.com/docview/1495433835?accountid=11774;;; References;;; 61;;; Cognitive style , Instructional design , Educational technology;;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aeducation&amp;atitle=Towards+designing+cognitively-enriched+project-oriented+courses+within+a+blended+problem-based+learning+context&amp;title=Education+and+Information+Technologies&amp;issn=13602357&amp;date=2014-03-01&amp;volume=19&amp;issue=1&amp;spage=61&amp;au=Tambouris%2C+Efthimios%3BZotou%2C+Maria%3BTarabanis%2C+Konstantinos&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=Education+and+Information+Technologies&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/10.1007%2Fs10639-012-9209-9";ProQuest Central,Social Science Premium Collection
Mixing Problem Based Learning And Conventional Teaching Methods In An Analog Electronics Course;"  This study, undertaken at the Walter Sisulu University of Technology (WSU) in South Africa, describes how problem-based learning (PBL) affects the first year 'analog electronics course', when PBL and the lecturing mode is compared. Problems were designed to match real-life situations. Data between the experimental group and the control group that related to attitudinal effect; the amount of reflection and learning outcome effects, were compared. A strong correlation was found between the students' attitudes and project marks for those who used the problem-based learning method. It was found that students who followed the PBL method learned to do research, learned better how to work in groups and developed greater confidence. Also what they learned was more of a practical value and they had more positive attitudes and reflected more, but there were no significant improvements in their learning. This research is in response to the real need to address gaps between employer expectations and higher education outcomes in South Africa.";1822108542;;;Scholarly Journals;;"Podges, J M;PAM Kommers Kommers;K Winnips Winnips;WR van Joolingen van Joolingen";;;; Copyright The Clute Institute 2014; 10.19030/ajee.v5i2.8973; Journal Article;;; 2014;;2153-2516;2; English; English;; 99-114; Littleton;2014;American Journal of Engineering Education;;2014;;;5;https://search.proquest.com/docview/1822108542?accountid=11774;;;;;; 99;;;; PBL , Problem-Solving , Engineering Education , Electronics Practical;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aengineeringjournals&amp;atitle=Mixing+Problem+Based+Learning+And+Conventional+Teaching+Methods+In+An+Analog+Electronics+Course&amp;title=American+Journal+of+Engineering+Education&amp;issn=21532516&amp;date=2014-01-01&amp;volume=5&amp;issue=2&amp;spage=99&amp;au=Podges%2C+J+M%3BPAM+Kommers+Kommers%3BK+Winnips+Winnips%3BWR+van+Joolingen+van+Joolingen&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=American+Journal+of+Engineering+Education&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/10.19030%2Fajee.v5i2.8973";ProQuest Central,SciTech Premium Collection

Educational Data Mining and Problem-Based Learning;  This paper considers the use of log data provided by learning management systems when studying whether students obey the problem-based learning (PBL) method. Log analysis turns out to be a valuable tool in measuring the use of the learning material of interest. It gives reliable figures concerning not only the number of use sessions but also the interlocking of various course activities. The longitudinal study based on log analysis makes use of a new software tool, SPY US. Our study concentrates on using log data analysis in improving the PBL method used in learning diagnostic skills with the help of Virtual Patients.;1562511957;;;Scholarly Journals;;"Walldén, Sari;Mäkinen, Erkki";;;; Copyright Institute of Mathematics and Informatics 2014;; Journal Article;;; 2014;;1648-5831;1; English; English;; 141-156; Vilnius;2014;Informatics in Education;;2014;;;13;https://search.proquest.com/docview/1562511957?accountid=11774;;;;;; 141;;; Data mining , Problem solving , Learning , Education;;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aeducation&amp;atitle=Educational+Data+Mining+and+Problem-Based+Learning&amp;title=Informatics+in+Education&amp;issn=16485831&amp;date=2014-01-01&amp;volume=13&amp;issue=1&amp;spage=141&amp;au=Walld%C3%A9n%2C+Sari%3BM%C3%A4kinen%2C+Erkki&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=Informatics+in+Education&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/";ProQuest Central,SciTech Premium Collection,Social Science Premium Collection
Design and Implementation of a Capstone Course to Satisfy the Industry Needs of Virtual Product Development and ABET Engineering Criteria;  Over the past two decades, computer aided engineering (CAE) processes and procedures became an integral part of the product development cycle. Virtual product development (VPD) refers to procedures that integrate the CAE tools in a unified approach that spans all the product development phases. Current industrial trends utilize VPD tools and procedures to reduce the product development time without jeopardizing the product quality. These trends led to an increasing demand for engineers with computer skills, multidisciplinary engineering knowledge, and acquaintance with VPD tools. ABET program outcomes emphasize providing courses with an accumulated background of curricular components to solve realistic open-ended engineering problems. Capstone design project (CDP) course has been regarded as important learning activity that could be designed to provide senior engineering student an opportunity to solve such problems. A major objective of the CDP course is to simulate industrial setting and allow students to experience real-life engineering practice. This paper presents an implementation of the VPD procedures in a mechanical engineering CDP course. This integration simulates the industrial environment through multidisciplinary teams working together in subsystems to produce one product using standard commercial VPD tools. This course implementation is demonstrated using a case study of teams working to design and build a solar car.;1547917799;;;Scholarly Journals;;Omar, Mohamed A;;;; Copyright © 2014 Mohamed A. Omar.

Student projects empowering mobile learning in higher education: Revista de Universidad y Sociedad del Conocimiento Revista de Universidad y Sociedad del Conocimiento;  Educational institutions are facing the challenge of providing students with tools for mobile learning (m-learning). However, the evolution of technology makes the development and continuous improvement of these tools rather expensive. For example, it is difficult to assess the different technology options available and to choose which ones are best suited to a particular context. In this article, the proposed solution is to engage students on technology degree courses in the development of m-learning tools. The Open University of Catalonia (UOC) is analyzed as a case study, and several examples of tools developed by students as part of their final year projects are presented. These projects explore different technologies and provide useful information to guide institutional investment in the development of m-learning tools. Akin to the collaborative development model in the field of open source software, this paradigm therefore can ensure the sustainability of m-learning in educational institutions.

Evaluating the Impact and Determinants of Student Team Performance: Using LMS and CATME Data;  Practitioners find it difficult to allocate grades to individual students based on their contributions to the team project. They often use classroom observation of teamwork and student peer evaluations to differentiate an individual's grade from the group's grade, which can be subjective and imprecise. We used objective data from student activity logs from our Learning Management System (LMS) as well as peer evaluations from the Comprehensive Assessment of Team Member Effectiveness' website (CATME.org) to determine impacts on team grades and peer evaluations. We found that student activity in our LMS and conflict scores from peer evaluations (CATME) do correlate with grades, as do GPAs and credits earned at the College. We also found that, while the class was in session, we could use the data from the LMS and CATME scores to intervene with those teams that were experiencing conflict to help them learn productive conflict-resolution skills.;1543335895;;;Scholarly Journals;;"Braender, Lynn M;Naples, Michele I";;" College of New Jersey

Student-Inspired Activities for the Teaching and Learning of Engineering Ethics;  Issue Title: European Perspectives on Teaching Social Responsibility in Science and Engineering Ethics teaching in engineering can be problematic because of student perceptions of its subjective, ambiguous and philosophical content. The use of discipline-specific case studies has helped to address such perceptions, as has practical decision making and problem solving approaches based on some ethical frameworks. However, a need exists for a wider range of creative methods in ethics education to help complement the variety of activities and learning experiences within the engineering curriculum. In this work, a novel approach is presented in which first-year undergraduate students are responsible for proposing ethics education activities of relevance to their peers and discipline area. The students are prepared for the task through a short introduction on engineering ethics, whereby generic frameworks for moral and professional conduct are discussed, and discipline and student-relevance contexts provided. The approach has been used in four departments of engineering at Imperial College London, and has led to the generation of many creative ideas for wider student engagement in ethics awareness, reflection and understanding. The paper presents information on the premise of the introductory sessions for supporting the design task, and an evaluation of the student experience of the course and task work. Examples of proposals are given to demonstrate the value of such an approach to teachers, and ultimately to the learning experiences of the students themselves.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT];1466162851; 21800172;;Scholarly Journals;;Alpay, E;;;; Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht 2013; 10.1007/s11948-011-9297-8; Feature , Journal Article;;; Dec 2013;;1353-3452;4; English; English;; 1455-68; New York;Dec 2013;Science and Engineering Ethics;;2013;;;19;https://search.proquest.com/docview/1466162851?accountid=11774;;; References;;; 1455;; Engineering -- education , Humans , London , Mental Processes , Science -- education , Universities; Engineering , Ethics , Perceptions , College students , Learning;;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Asciencejournals&amp;atitle=Student-Inspired+Activities+for+the+Teaching+and+Learning+of+Engineering+Ethics&amp;title=Science+and+Engineering+Ethics&amp;issn=13533452&amp;date=2013-12-01&amp;volume=19&amp;issue=4&amp;spage=1455&amp;au=Alpay%2C+E&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=Science+and+Engineering+Ethics&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/21800172&amp;rft_id=info:doi/10.1007%2Fs11948-011-9297-8";ProQuest Central,SciTech Premium Collection
Using MBTI for the success assessment of engineering teams in project-based learning;  Project-Based Learning (PBL) is a teaching and learning methodology that emphasizes student centered instruction by assigning projects. The students have to conduct significant projects and cope with realistic working conditions and scenarios. PBL is generally done by groups of students working together towards a common goal. Several factors play a significant role on the final success of each group. It is not only the technical aspects that have an influence on their final achievements, but also the human aspects and group dynamics. These dynamics can be studied through personality assessments, the Myers-Brigss Type Indicator (MBTI) being one of the most used and well-known methods. The MBTI is a psychometric questionnaire designed to measure psychological preferences in how people perceive the world and make decisions. Although MBTI strictly speaking just only identifies a personality type of an individual, it taps into key aspects of personality and behavior in areas such as communication, problem solving, decision making, and interpersonal relations. Several studies have also related MBTI profiles with leadership styles. The MBTI also helps in understanding group dynamics, analyzing shortcomings in an individual's style and how the style affects the group as a whole. MBTI has been widely used in Team Building, Conflict Resolutions, Communication Skills and Understanding. The purpose of this work is to study how different combinations of student profiles could explain different group dynamics and at the same time, to predict the final success in a group. Knowing more about the personality of the team members, their leadership styles and how different personalities get along or conflict with each other can be useful information for building successful PBL groups. To this purpose, the final results of eight different student groups are analyzed, studying the influence of the MBTI profiles of their members with the group success. The final results obtained in this study suggest that the leadership style associated with the profile of the student playing the role of group coordinator and the members' profile combinations have an influence on the group's success.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT];1447763602;;;Scholarly Journals;;"Rodríguez Montequín, V;Mesa Fernández, J M;Balsera, J Villanueva;García Nieto, A";;;; Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht 2013; 10.1007/s10798-012-9229-1; Feature;;; Nov 2013;;0957-7572;4; English; English;; 1127-1146; Dordrecht;Nov 2013;International Journal of Technology and Design Education;;2013;;;23;https://search.proquest.com/docview/1447763602?accountid=11774;;; References;;; 1127;;; Science education , Collaboration , Engineering schools;;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aeducation&amp;atitle=Using+MBTI+for+the+success+assessment+of+engineering+teams+in+project-based+learning&amp;title=International+Journal+of+Technology+and+Design+Education&amp;issn=09577572&amp;date=2013-11-01&amp;volume=23&amp;issue=4&amp;spage=1127&amp;au=Rodr%C3%ADguez+Montequ%C3%ADn%2C+V%3BMesa+Fern%C3%A1ndez%2C+J+M%3BBalsera%2C+J+Villanueva%3BGarc%C3%ADa+Nieto%2C+A&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=International+Journal+of+Technology+and+Design+Education&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/10.1007%2Fs10798-012-9229-1";Art, Design & Architecture Collection,ProQuest Central,SciTech Premium Collection,Social Science Premium Collection
Team Effectiveness Theory from Industrial and Organizational Psychology Applied to Engineering Student Project Teams: A Research Review;  Engineering student team projects are frequently used to meet professional learning outcomes. Industrial and organizational psychologists study teams in the industry settings for which we prepare students, yet this research does not effectively inform engineering education. This research review sought to demonstrate the relevance of literature on teams literature from industrial and organizational psychology to engineering education and to identify implications for practice and future directions for research. Phase 1 systematically reviewed 104 articles published from 2007 to 2012 describing engineering and computer science student team projects and sought to answer the following questions: What professional learning outcomes have been met by team projects? What negative student team behaviors have faculty sought to minimize? What literature has been used to inform development of teamwork outcomes? Phase 2 reviewed five team effectiveness constructs selected according to the results of Phase 1: social loafing, interdependence, conflict, trust, and shared mental models. Examples from Phase 1 articles and our own work explain how this research informs facilitation and assessment of engineering student teams. Engineering faculty sought to achieve a variety of outcomes through team projects, including teamwork, communication, sustainability, and consideration of global/societal design context.

IS Learning: The Impact of Gender and Team Emotional Intelligence;  In university settings, dysfunction in teamwork often challenges problem-based learning in IS projects. Researchers of IS Education have largely overlooked Team Emotional Intelligence (TEI), which offers a collective cognitive skill that may benefit the student learning experience. Hypothesized are four dimensions of emotional intelligence (EI) that influence perceived effectiveness in IS learning teams. This paper proposes a model that explains how these four dimensions influence perceived team effectiveness and how gender affects this relationship. A survey administered to 384 students resulting in 94 IS learning teams produced regression (and moderated regression) results showing that gender, along with two TEI dimensions (awareness and management of one's own emotion) predict team effectiveness. Significant results suggest gender differences in the relationship between a team member's awareness of his or her own emotions, management of others' emotions, and team effectiveness. These findings suggest IS educators should focus on targeted interventions that may help to foster the development of emotionally intelligent IS learning teams. Most prominently, gender plays an important role for emotional intelligence competencies, where differences exist in awareness of one's own emotions and management of others' emotions among student learning teams.

Improving Teaching Methodology in System Analysis and Design using Problem Based Learning for ABET;  System Analysis and Design is an active field that demonstrates continuously new techniques and approaches to develop systems more effectively and efficiently. Teaching System Analysis and Design courses are thus quite challenging for many reasons, such as rapid changes in the environment, changes in the nature of technology, demands and needs of the industry and new market trends. These factors will have a direct effect on the students learning and their effectiveness in the place of work. This paper examines this trend and considers Problem Based Learning as the best methodology to respond to them. It will improve the students understanding of the concepts, ideas and thus enhance their learning experience. This paper also examines the level of achievements in the course learning outcomes as outlined by Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology.;1627736304;;;Scholarly Journals;;"Fatima, Sara;Salha Abdullah";;;; Copyright Modern Education and Computer Science Press Sep 2013; 10.5815/ijmecs.2013.07.07; Journal Article;;; Sep 2013;;2075-0161;7; English; English;; 60-68; Hong Kong;Sep 2013;International Journal of Modern Education and Computer Science;;2013;;;5;https://search.proquest.com/docview/1627736304?accountid=11774;;;;;; 60;;;; System Analysis , Design , Problem based learning , ABET , ACM , KSO , CLO , PEO;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aeducation&amp;atitle=Improving+Teaching+Methodology+in+System+Analysis+and+Design+using+Problem+Based+Learning+for+ABET&amp;title=International+Journal+of+Modern+Education+and+Computer+Science&amp;issn=20750161&amp;date=2013-09-01&amp;volume=5&amp;issue=7&amp;spage=60&amp;au=Fatima%2C+Sara%3BSalha+Abdullah&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=International+Journal+of+Modern+Education+and+Computer+Science&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/10.5815%2Fijmecs.2013.07.07";ProQuest Central,SciTech Premium Collection,Social Science Premium Collection

Doctor of Nursing Practice Programs: Opportunities for Faculty Development: [1];"  This article examines development opportunities for faculty teaching in Doctor of Nursing Practice (DNP) programs. Although faculty development for DNP programs is similar to that of other academic programs, faculty may need different strategies for teaching, scholarship, and service because DNP programs focus on translation of science into practice, systems-level changes, clinical scholarship, and the highest levels of advanced nursing practice. Faculty and student collaboration across DNP and PhD programs provide new approaches for translating research into practice and generating practice questions in need of further scientific development. Specific faculty development strategies for facilitating this collaboration are essential. Capstone projects pose special opportunities for faculty development due to the integration of these projects within diverse practice environments, with differing expectations, regulations, and pacing compared with research. Linking new care delivery models with health informatics is expected to facilitate rapid translation of research and development of improvements in practice.

EFFECT OF PROBLEM-BASED LEARNING ON SENIOR SECONDARY SCHOOL STUDENTS' ACHIEVEMENTS IN FURTHER MATHEMATICS;  The study investigated the effect of Problem-based learning (PBL) on senior secondary school students' achievements in Further Mathematics (FM) in Nigeria within the blueprint of pre-test-post-test non-equivalent control group quasi-experimental design. Intact classes were used and in all, 96 students participated in the study (42 in the experimental group taught with the PBL and 54 in the control group taught using the Traditional Method (TM)). One research instrument manipulated at two levels namely: Teacher-Made Test (TMT) and Researcher-Designed Test (RDT), was developed and used for the study and data collected were analysed using the descriptive statistics of mean and standard deviation which served as precursor to testing the two hypotheses for the study using an independent samples t-test. Results showed that there were statistically significant differences in the mean post-test achievement scores on TMT and mean post-test achievement scores on RDT between students exposed to the PBL and those exposed to the TM, all in favour of the PBL group. Based on the results, the study recommended that the PBL should be adopted as alternative instructional strategy to the TM in enhancing meaningful learning in Further Mathematics classrooms and efforts should be made to integrate the philosophy of PBL into the pre-service teachers' curriculum at the teacher-preparation institutions in Nigeria.

Semantic Wiki: A Tool for Collaborative Learning Environment in Computer Engineering Education;  Computer engineering education encourages students to enhance their communication skills, critical thinking, analysis capabilities and abilities with group working. A successful way of improving student abilities is to organize them in work teams for specific tasks. These specific tasks play an important role for computer engineering students to gain habit of working together during all stages of a project development. Active learning methods can be used in the development of fundamental student qualifications. Collaborative learning methods such as project oriented learning and problem based learning are beneficial techniques to accomplish powerful active learning to promote engineering student's creative and critical thinking. In recent years, web-based collaborative learning strategies have emerged with the growing usage of Web 2.0 based internet technologies which allow web users to create and exchange information actively. One of the most popular tools is the Media Wiki platform used for collaboration among students in web-based education. This Wiki tool creates new opportunities for students to edit learning resources and to share, create, discuss or to modify their projects together. Wikis are mature technology constructed with new trends in e-leaming education such as discussion pages and history pages. On the other hand, Semantic Wiki that is a combination of Wiki and Semantic Web (Web 3.0) technology has not completely explored yet. Semantic Wiki enables users more advanced searching and navigation facilities by using annotations of course materials. In this paper, we introduce the opportunities of Media Wiki and Semantic Wiki platforms for collaborative computer engineering education.

Service-Learning in a Capstone Modeling Course;  A capstone course is often synthetic, bringing together many components of a student's educational background. For this reason, a project-based course in mathematical modeling makes a great capstone, as modeling problems often require a broad collection of mathematical tools for their solution. The addition of a service-learning component can further deepen the capstone experience, as it informs the way students look at a problem and motivates them to create solutions that are both reasonable and implementable. Students also have an added incentive to improve their written and oral skills for their final presentations. In this article, we describe how to build and incorporate a project from a community partner into a modeling capstone course. We include teaching notes and some student responses.

Teaching Case Enterprise Architecture Specification Case Study;"  A graduate course in enterprise architecture had a team project component in which a real-world business case, provided by an industry sponsor, formed the basis of the project charter and the architecture statement of work. The paper aims to share the team project experience on developing the architecture specifications based on the business case of an accountable health care organization. Students collaborated as a team in various roles to develop the architecture specifications for a new business initiative of the sponsoring organization, XYZ ACO. The teaching case describes the case study approach and the architecture approach adopted for the architecture process, and is accompanied by Teaching Case Notes which provide a selection of the models developed by members of the project team towards the architecture specifications. The course started with coverage of enterprise architecture theory, best practices and standards, and the team project gave students the opportunity to apply their theoretical knowledge and ""learn by doing"". Students were challenged to interpret the business case, the project charter and project requirements, and each team member was allocated an architecture viewpoint and a role to play. The Teaching Case presents a summary of the team project and the lessons learned in performing the project.

Advanced Learning Tools for (Non) Formal Education;  An important part of the articles published in the last years highlight teaching and learning approaches and technologies integrated in complex applications and present the concepts used for creating and presenting the educational content. They refer to the methodologies used in self-and collaborative learning, including problem-and project-based learning. The assessment process is also illustrated in several articles but there is no a generic framework that complies with the rules of both formal and non-formal education acts. Our proposal is focused on advanced concepts for improving the educational services and the manner a generic framework for blended learning can be customized for higher education and lifelong learning. In addition, the paper proposes a virtual collaboration prototype that supports interpersonal and inter-process collaborative learning services that can be used as core of any rapidly growing educational community.;1430383942;;;Scholarly Journals;;"Porumb, Sanda;Porumb, Cosmin;Vlaicu, Aurel;Orza, Bogdan";;;; Copyright Trans Tech Publications Ltd.

University ESL Learners Cross-Cultural Transitions through Web-Based Project Work;  This study sought to account for East Asian learners cross-cultural transitions to US university Intensive English classroom culture within a technology-mediated language teaching approach, PrOCALL (Project-Oriented Computer Assisted Language Learning). It explored the influence of this approach on classroom interaction patterns acquired in the prior EFL (English as a Foreign Language) classrooms of their countries of origin. Our interpretation of this influence demonstrates that web-based project work has potential to boost cross-cultural communication, facilitating East Asian learners socialization to the interactive norms of the US university Intensive English classroom. In the study, a group of ESL (English as a Second Language) learners in a university Intensive English high-intermediate reading class implemented a cross-cultural project using web-based authentic materials and tasks. They were involved in decision-making on a cultural topic for a group project, data collection on their cultural topic, group webpage design, and oral presentation. During these activities, learners showed interest and engagement in getting to know other cultures and increased oral interactions. Interviews with the learners confirmed that their classroom interactions had been enhanced through the web-based project implementation.;1490741179;;;Scholarly Journals;;"Kang, Migyu;Katherine Richardson Bruna";;;; Copyright iManager Publications Apr-Jun 2013;; Feature;;; Apr-Jun 2013;;0973-0559;1; English; English;; 22-35; Nagercoil;Apr-Jun 2013;i-Manager's Journal of Educational Technology;;2013;;;10;https://search.proquest.com/docview/1490741179?accountid=11774;;; References;;; 22;;; English as a second language--ESL , College students , Online information services , Cultural differences , Foreign students; Web-Based Project , Technology-Mediated Approach , Cross-Cultural Transition;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aindianjournals&amp;atitle=University+ESL+Learners+Cross-Cultural+Transitions+through+Web-Based+Project+Work&amp;title=i-Manager%27s+Journal+of+Educational+Technology&amp;issn=09730559&amp;date=2013-04-01&amp;volume=10&amp;issue=1&amp;spage=22&amp;au=Kang%2C+Migyu%3BKatherine+Richardson+Bruna&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=i-Manager%27s+Journal+of+Educational+Technology&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/";ProQuest Central
SimEx: Simulation Exercises on Humanitarian Crisis;  A Software Engineering Capstone Service Learning project team at Fairfield University developed SimEx (Simulation Exercises on Humanitarian Crisis), a database driven web application for the JUHAN (Jesuits University Humanitarian Action Network) community to educate students on humanitarian actions and to enhance their knowledge on how to react at the time of a crisis. SimEx is accessible to anyone in the JUHAN community around the world and helps facilitate interaction among instructors, researchers, and student including sharing simulation exercise scenarios and providing students simulation exercises on humanitarian actions without any boundaries. SimEx also provides a discussion board to the JUHAN community to facilitate communication and idea sharing. SimEx was implemented in PHP with a MySQL database and several additional PHP plug-ins. In this paper, we describe the issues, process, and outcome of the collaborative service learning project between academia and community and discuss the future direction of SimEx.;1368765670;;;Scholarly Journals;;Yoo, Wook-Sung;;;; Copyright Pennsylvania State University Spring 2013;; Case Study;;; Spring 2013;;;1; English; English;;; University Park;Spring 2013;International Journal for Service Learning in Engineering;;2013;;;8;https://search.proquest.com/docview/1368765670?accountid=11774;;;;;; 48;;;;;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=unknown&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aengineeringjournals&amp;atitle=SimEx%3A+Simulation+Exercises+on+Humanitarian+Crisis&amp;title=International+Journal+for+Service+Learning+in+Engineering&amp;issn=&amp;date=2013-04-01&amp;volume=8&amp;issue=1&amp;spage=48&amp;au=Yoo%2C+Wook-Sung&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=International+Journal+for+Service+Learning+in+Engineering&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/";ProQuest Central,SciTech Premium Collection
Effects of Academic Service Learning in Drug Misuse and Addiction on Students' Learning Preferences and Attitudes Toward Harm Reduction;  To examine academic service-learning pedagogy on student learning and perceptions of drug misuse and addiction. Third- and fourth-year pharmacology students were exposed to an academic service-learning pedagogy that integrated a community service experience with lectures, in-class discussions and debates, group projects, a final paper, and an examination. Reflective writing assignments throughout the course required students to assimilate and apply what they had learned in the classroom to what they learned in their community placement. Changes in students' responses on pre- and post-course survey instruments reflected shifts toward higher-order thinking. Also, subjective student-learning modalities shifted toward learning by writing. Students' perspectives and attitudes allowed improved context of issues associated with drug misuse and harm reduction models. Academic service-learning pedagogy contributes to developing adaptable, well-rounded, engaged learners who become more compassionate and pragmatic in addressing scientific and social questions relating to drug addiction.;1355435779; 23610481;;Scholarly Journals;;"Kabli, Noufissa, MSc;Liu, Ben, MEd;Seifert, Tricia, PhD;Arnot, Michelle I, PhD";;" University of Toronto

Migrating Successful Student Engagement Strategies Online: Opportunities and Challenges Using Jigsaw Groups and Problem-Based Learning;  Online courses may be criticized for failing to engage students. Faculty members teaching in the classroom often employ a number of strategies that capture the interest of students, but may find the migration to the online environment a daunting prospect. This paper describes the transitioning of two common strategies to engage students in the classroom - jigsaw groups and problem-based learning - from face-to-face to online courses in sociology and soil science, respectively. The paper discusses the challenges and opportunities that were found to be common to the implementation of both these strategies online, and provides suggestions for faculty considering this transition.;1500386307;;;Scholarly Journals;;"Amador, José A;Mederer, Helen";;;; Copyright Multimedia Educational Resource for Learning and Online Teaching (MERLOT) Mar 2013;; Journal Article;;; Mar 2013;;;1; English; English;;;  Long Beach;Mar 2013;Journal of Online Learning and Teaching;;2013;;;9;https://search.proquest.com/docview/1500386307?accountid=11774;;;;;; 89;;; Distance learning , Online instruction , Reading comprehension , Colleges & universities; online teaching , engaging teaching strategies , sociology , soil science , problem-based learning , jigsaw groups;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aeducation&amp;atitle=Migrating+Successful+Student+Engagement+Strategies+Online%3A+Opportunities+and+Challenges+Using+Jigsaw+Groups+and+Problem-Based+Learning&amp;title=Journal+of+Online+Learning+and+Teaching&amp;issn=&amp;date=2013-03-01&amp;volume=9&amp;issue=1&amp;spage=89&amp;au=Amador%2C+Jos%C3%A9+A%3BMederer%2C+Helen&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=Journal+of+Online+Learning+and+Teaching&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/";ProQuest Central,Social Science Premium Collection
Applications of blogging in problem based learning;"  The context of the study presented in this paper is a sixth-semester undergraduate course on ""Relational database management system"" that was held in session 2009-2010. The course is part of the bachelor's degree curriculum of Computer Science and Engineering branch at Punjab Technical University, Punjab, India. It consists of a lecture course and a concurrent lab course. The common approach has been to divide the course into lectures, tutorials, and practicals. To conduct practical sessions, lab plan is prepared beforehand by the faculty. The course duration is 14-16 weeks. Here the lab course was conducted in a blended learning mode, starting with syllabus related tasks, then subject specific projects, and presenting team project results. Problem based learning (PBL) and Blogging have been introduced for practical sessions. This paper describes this novel approach in which problems are designed to cover the syllabus topics, and blogging is used to bridge the communication gap. A significant difference was seen between performance and attitude of the treatment group (PBL with blogging) and control group (only PBL) for Lab sessions. Additionally teamwork and communication skills were also significantly improved in the case of PBL with blogging class.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]";1285236272;;;Scholarly Journals;;"Chhabra, Rishu;Sharma, Vandana";;;; Springer Science+Business Media New York 2013; 10.1007/s10639-011-9168-6; Feature;;; Mar 2013;;1360-2357;1; English;;; 3-13; New York;Mar 2013;Education and Information Technologies;;2013;;;18;https://search.proquest.com/docview/1285236272?accountid=11774;;; References;;; 3;;; Relational data bases , Educational technology , Higher education , Problem solving , Blogs;;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aeducation&amp;atitle=Applications+of+blogging+in+problem+based+learning&amp;title=Education+and+Information+Technologies&amp;issn=13602357&amp;date=2013-03-01&amp;volume=18&amp;issue=1&amp;spage=3&amp;au=Chhabra%2C+Rishu%3BSharma%2C+Vandana&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=Education+and+Information+Technologies&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/10.1007%2Fs10639-011-9168-6";ProQuest Central,Social Science Premium Collection
Changing attitudes and facilitating understanding in the undergraduate statistics classroom: A collaborative learning approach;Collaborative and problem-based learning strategies are theorized to be effective methods for strengthening undergraduate science, technology, engineering, and mathematics education. Peer-Led Team Learning (PLTL) is a collaborative learning technique that engages students in problem solving and discussion under the guidance of a trained peer facilitator. This comparative study investigates the impact of a PLTL-based learning community program on both content mastery and dispositions of undergraduate students taking an introductory course in applied statistics. Results suggest that students participating in the learning community program acquired significantly greater content mastery in statistics when compared to non-participating peers. Moreover, the learning community experience may provide students with a buffer against developing the negative attitudes and perceptions that often pervade the undergraduate applied statistics classroom.;2387858286;;;Scholarly Journals;;"Curran, Erin M;Carlson, Kerri;Dayius L Turvold Celotta";;;; © 2013.

The influence of personality and ability on undergraduate teamwork and team performance;  The ability to work effectively on a team is highly valued by employers, and collaboration among students can lead to intrinsic motivation, increased persistence, and greater transferability of skills. Moreover, innovation often arises from multidisciplinary teamwork. The influence of personality and ability on undergraduate teamwork and performance is not comprehensively understood. An investigation was undertaken to explore correlations between team outcomes, personality measures and ability in an undergraduate population. Team outcomes included various self-, peer- and instructor ratings of skills, performance, and experience. Personality measures and ability involved the Five-Factor Model personality traits and GPA. Personality, GPA, and teamwork survey data, as well as instructor evaluations were collected from upper division team project courses in engineering, business, political science, and industrial design at a large public university. Characteristics of a multidisciplinary student team project were briefly examined. Personality, in terms of extraversion scores, was positively correlated with instructors' assessment of team performance in terms of oral and written presentation scores, which is consistent with prior research. Other correlations to instructor-, students' self- and peer-ratings were revealed and merit further study. The findings in this study can be used to understand important influences on successful teamwork, teamwork instruction and intervention and to understand the design of effective curricula in this area moving forward.;1866082974;;;Scholarly Journals;;"Rhee, Jinny;Parent, David;Basu, Anuradha";;;; SpringerPlus is a copyright of Springer, 2013.; 10.1186/2193-1801-2-16; Journal Article;;; Jan 2013;;;1; English; English;; 1-14; Heidelberg;Jan 2013;SpringerPlus;;2013;;;2;https://search.proquest.com/docview/1866082974?accountid=11774;;;;;; 1;;;; Five-factor personality model , Big five personality model , Ability , Teamwork instruction , Capstone course;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aengineeringjournals&amp;atitle=The+influence+of+personality+and+ability+on+undergraduate+teamwork+and+team+performance&amp;title=SpringerPlus&amp;issn=&amp;date=2013-01-01&amp;volume=2&amp;issue=1&amp;spage=1&amp;au=Rhee%2C+Jinny%3BParent%2C+David%3BBasu%2C+Anuradha&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=SpringerPlus&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/10.1186%2F2193-1801-2-16";ProQuest Central,SciTech Premium Collection
"Different Tools &amp; Techniques for Quality Improvement in Professional Education";"  The purpose of this paper is to determine the effectiveness of various teaching methods used for teaching students at graduate and post graduate levels. Two hundred technical students were interviewed about their perceptions of best and effective teaching methods and the reason for that. Most of the students rated lecture method as the best teaching method. Reasons included; teacher provides all knowledge related to topic, saving of time, students attentively listen to lectures and take notes, etc. Group discussion was rated as the second best method of teaching. The Project-based collaborative learning is an active, problem-centered approach to teaching and learning. As the name implies, it is a fusion of two related approaches- project-based learning and collaborative learning. Use of writing in engineering courses can help in achieving both technical depth and educational breadth in engineering programs. Engineering students can use words in describing concepts so that they will be encouraged to develop a linear, logical, and connected set of ideas in understanding them. Each student is thus forced to think carefully and in detail.

Social network analysis of students' participation and presence in a community of educational blogging;"  Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to report on an investigation of university students' participation and learning presence in a blogging activity, designed to support collaborative learning. There are three main reasons justifying the current research: to better understand the structure and the dynamics of students' blogging subgroups; to reveal students' patterns of engagement and their roles within the blogging community; and to evaluate the applicability of social network analysis (SNA) in studying students' performance and learning presence in educational blogs. Design/methodology/approach - The design of students' blogging activities was rooted on the ideas of authentic learning and followed a project-based learning philosophy. Data analysis used methods of SNA to reveal collaborative aspects of students' engagement, the different roles undertaken by the students and the structure of the community within group blogs. Findings - SNA shed light into the different patterns of students' participation and the dynamics of students' learning presence within the community of group blogs. Research findings, both quantitative and qualitative, indicated that the majority of the students in the sample were generally active and exhibited learning presence actions within their group blog. Differences between students in the various groups were also recorded. Research limitations/implications - The study reported here is limited by the specific sample and the context of implementation. Future research will be directed towards applying the Community of Inquiry schema, in a way complimentary to SNA, to further analyse students' learning and cognitive presence in the community of the whole blogging project. Originality/value - The originality of the paper concerns both the educational design of the blog-based project activities and the use of SNA to reveal the different patterns of students' participation in educational blogging activities. Results could be of value for both educators and researchers in the field.";1355412940;;;Scholarly Journals;;"Jimoyiannis, Athanassios;Tsiotakis, Panagiotis;Roussinos, Dimitrios";;;; Copyright Emerald Group Publishing Limited 2013; 10.1108/17415651311326428; Feature;;; 2013;;1741-5659;1; English;;; 15-30; Bingley;2013;Interactive Technology and Smart Education;;2013;;;10;https://search.proquest.com/docview/1355412940?accountid=11774;;; References;;; 15;;; Higher education , Social networks , Participation , University students , Independent study , Learning , Blogs;;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aeducation&amp;atitle=Social+network+analysis+of+students%27+participation+and+presence+in+a+community+of+educational+blogging&amp;title=Interactive+Technology+and+Smart+Education&amp;issn=17415659&amp;date=2013-01-01&amp;volume=10&amp;issue=1&amp;spage=15&amp;au=Jimoyiannis%2C+Athanassios%3BTsiotakis%2C+Panagiotis%3BRoussinos%2C+Dimitrios&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=Interactive+Technology+and+Smart+Education&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/10.1108%2F17415651311326428";ProQuest Central,SciTech Premium Collection,Social Science Premium Collection
Learning through cooperation and competition;"  In this study, we look into the effects of cooperation and competition on learning outcomes in three universities from Finland, Spain, and Turkey. Feedback was collected via online survey from students who participated in the monitored international group competition. Our results support positive impacts of cooperation on learning outcomes but deny any negative impacts of competition. We argue further that learning outcomes are also influenced by cultural differences in perceptions towards cooperation and competition. Overall, we find the international group project competition with analysis of real-life business problems a creative approach to stimulate enhanced learning for raising ""intelligent consumers of business statistics"".

Adapting to Change in a Master Level Real-World-Projects Capstone Course;Our mission of capstone computing courses for the past ten years has been to offer students experience with the development of real-world information technology projects. This experience has included both the hard and soft skills required for the work they could expect as industrial practitioners. Hard skills entail extending one's knowledge structure with technical know-how, specifically using the latest software and hardware tools for building applications of genuine utility. Soft skills include the ability to work in a collaborative setting (e.g., to participate in team coordination and governance), the ability to interact with a customer (e.g., to establish product requirements and achieve acceptance), the ethos of creating value, and a facility for technical communications (written, oral, and electronic). Significant changes in the instructional environment have taken place in the ten years since the capstone class was first offered. This paper describes the adaptation to changes in the course's delivery so that its mission continues to be fulfilled successfully.;1895971816; EJ1136642;;Scholarly Journals;;"Tappert, Charles C.;Stix, Allen";;;;;; Article , Report , 080: Journal Articles , 141: Reports - Descriptive; 1545-679X;; Dec 2012;;;6; English; English;; 25-37;;Dec 2012;Information Systems Education Journal; Scholarly Journals , Reports;2012; http://isedj.org; ERIC, © Information Systems and Computing Academic Professionals;10;https://search.proquest.com/docview/1895971816?accountid=11774;;;;;; 25;;;  6400ER5 1802ER5 8362ER5  6379 1793 8331 ,  2065ER5 5172ER5 8290ER5 3164ER5  2054 5155 8260 3150 ,  10282ER5 9179ER5 126ER5  10240 9146 126 ,  2526ER5  2515 ,  4467ER5 1815ER5 10321ER5 8043ER5 4558ER5  4452 1806 10278 8016 4542 ,  3190ER5 1393ER5  3176 1387 ,  4525ER5 126ER5  4509 126 ,  10247ER5 3640ER5  10205 3626 ,  7356ER5 2085ER5 2084ER5 10719ER5 2362ER5 2526ER5  7330 2074 2073 10675 2351 2515 ,  10685ER5 4527ER5 912ER5  10642 4511 909 , New York; Higher Education , Postsecondary Education , New York;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aeric&amp;atitle=Adapting+to+Change+in+a+Master+Level+Real-World-Projects+Capstone+Course&amp;title=Information+Systems+Education+Journal&amp;issn=1545-679X&amp;date=2012-12-01&amp;volume=10&amp;issue=6&amp;spage=25&amp;au=Tappert%2C+Charles+C.%3BStix%2C+Allen&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=Information+Systems+Education+Journal&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/EJ1136642&amp;rft_id=info:doi/";Social Science Premium Collection
Learning to think spatially in an undergraduate interdisciplinary computational design context: a case study;"  Spatial thinking skills are vital for success in everyday living and work, not to mention the centrality of spatial reasoning in scientific discoveries, design-based disciplines, medicine, geosciences and mathematics to name a few. This case study describes a course in spatial thinking and communicating designed and delivered by an interdisciplinary team over a three-year period to first-year university students. Four major elements provide a framework for the sequencing of instruction and acquisition of 2D and 3D spatial thinking and reasoning skills in a computational design context. We describe the process of introducing students to computational design environments beginning with a fun and familiar tool in preparation for a more complex, industry-standard system (SolidWorks). A design project provides diverse student teams an opportunity to integrate and apply foundational spatial concepts and skills including sketching, 2D and 3D representations, as well as digital and physical modeling. Samples of student work illustrate the scaffolding necessary for students to successfully draw upon the spatial thinking and communication skills required to complete their team projects beginning with applying sketching techniques; modeling individual 3D parts; creating digital assemblies; and finally building the equivalent 3D physical model. Key instructional principles provide a framework for the analysis of what worked and what didn't in relation to spatial skills development in students. The lessons learned are identified along with potential future directions for teaching and learning scholarship in spatial thinking development within a computational design context.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]";1114687592;;;Scholarly Journals;;"Ben Youssef, Belgacem;Berry, Barbara";;;; Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht 2012; 10.1007/s10798-010-9151-3; Feature;;; Nov 2012;;0957-7572;4; English; English;; 541-564; Dordrecht;Nov 2012;International Journal of Technology and Design Education;;2012;;;22;https://search.proquest.com/docview/1114687592?accountid=11774;;;;;; 541;;; Case studies , Cognition & reasoning , Computer aided design--CAD;;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aeducation&amp;atitle=Learning+to+think+spatially+in+an+undergraduate+interdisciplinary+computational+design+context%3A+a+case+study&amp;title=International+Journal+of+Technology+and+Design+Education&amp;issn=09577572&amp;date=2012-11-01&amp;volume=22&amp;issue=4&amp;spage=541&amp;au=Ben+Youssef%2C+Belgacem%3BBerry%2C+Barbara&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=International+Journal+of+Technology+and+Design+Education&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/10.1007%2Fs10798-010-9151-3";Art, Design & Architecture Collection,ProQuest Central,SciTech Premium Collection,Social Science Premium Collection
A model of critical success factors for software projects;  Purpose - Existing models of critical success factors of software projects have less concentration on communication, team, project management and product related factors. Hence, the purpose of this paper is to develop a conceptual model of critical success factors (CSFs) for software development projects, categorize the success factors, finding the factors in each category and highlighting the product, team, project management and communication factors as important categories of success factors for software projects. Design/methodology/approach - A conceptual model and seven categories of success factors comprising a total of 80 success factors for software development projects were identified based on the thorough literature review. These 80 factors are collected based on their importance to software projects and their repeated occurrence in the literature related to CSFs. Based on the occurrence of the success factor in the literature, each category comprising top five success factors are identified as critical success factors for software projects. Based on these seven categories of success factors a conceptual model was developed. Findings - A total of 35 CSFs from seven CSF categories are identified from secondary research of the CSFs for software development projects. The identified CSFs include communication in project, top management support, clear project goal, reliability of output, project planning, teamwork, project team coordination, quality control, client acceptance, accuracy of output, reduce ambiguity, maximize stability, realistic expectations and user involvement. Project management, product, team and communication factors are identified as important categories of success factors for software projects. Research limitations/implications - Different categories of critical success factors such as product, project management, team and communication, which were not highlighted or categorized earlier in the literature are discussed in this current work. Practical implications - This research is definitely useful for organizations working on software projects. The project managers working in the industry can benefit from the mentioned critical success factors and the categories of factors by concentration on them while planning and executing software projects. Originality/value - The conceptual model, categorization of CSFs, identifying 35 CSFs for software projects and highlighting product, team and communication factors are major contributions of this research work.;1113518551;;;Scholarly Journals;;Goparaju, Purna Sudhakar; LINMEC;;; Copyright Emerald Group Publishing Limited 2012; 10.1108/17410391211272829; Feature;;; 2012;;1741-0398;6; English;;; 537-558; Bradford;2012;Journal of Enterprise Information Management;;2012;;;25;https://search.proquest.com/docview/1113518551?accountid=11774;;;;;; 537;;; Studies , Project management , Information systems , Software , Product development , Models , Success factors;;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aabiglobal&amp;atitle=A+model+of+critical+success+factors+for+software+projects&amp;title=Journal+of+Enterprise+Information+Management&amp;issn=17410398&amp;date=2012-11-01&amp;volume=25&amp;issue=6&amp;spage=537&amp;au=Goparaju%2C+Purna+Sudhakar&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=Journal+of+Enterprise+Information+Management&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/10.1108%2F17410391211272829";ProQuest Central,SciTech Premium Collection,Social Science Premium Collection
Project-Based Learning with an Online Peer Assessment System in a Photonics Instruction for Enhancing LED Design Skills;This study proposed a novel instructional approach, a two-stage LED simulation of Project-based learning (PBL) course with online peer assessment (OPA), and explored how to apply OPA to the different structured problems in a PBL course to enhance students' professional skills in LED design as well as meta-cognitive thinking. The participants of the study, 73 junior students were divided into two groups, OPA group (with OPA) and Traditional group (without OPA). The evaluation results were listed as follows. (1) OPA group performed better than Traditional group in concept clarification. (2) For the enhancement of LED design skills in well-structured problem solving, OPA group performed better than Traditional group. (3) For the enhancement of LED design skills in ill-structured problem solving, there was no significant difference between the performances of these two groups. (4) For students' perception about the effect of OPA applied in PBL, OPA group could benefit from inquiry learning and reflective thinking. Most students agreed that the two-stage LED simulation of PBL course was challenging and interesting and they learned useful things from the course.;1288340307;;;Scholarly Journals;;"Shu-Hsuan CHANG;WU, Tsung-Chih;Yen-Kuang KUO;Li-Chih YOU";;;; Copyright Sakarya University 2012;; Journal Article;;; 2012;;;4; English;;; n/a; Adapazari;2012;TOJET : The Turkish Online Journal of Educational Technology;;2012;;;11;https://search.proquest.com/docview/1288340307?accountid=11774;;;;;; n/a;;; Distance learning , Peer relationships , Students , Simulation , Design improvements , Learning , Group dynamics , Problem solving , On-line systems , Skills , Student attitudes , Photonics , Teaching methods , Metacognition , Problem solving , Students , Taiwan;;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aeducation&amp;atitle=Project-Based+Learning+with+an+Online+Peer+Assessment+System+in+a+Photonics+Instruction+for+Enhancing+LED+Design+Skills&amp;title=TOJET+%3A+The+Turkish+Online+Journal+of+Educational+Technology&amp;issn=&amp;date=2012-10-01&amp;volume=11&amp;issue=4&amp;spage=&amp;au=Shu-Hsuan+CHANG%3BWU%2C+Tsung-Chih%3BYen-Kuang+KUO%3BLi-Chih+YOU&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=TOJET+%3A+The+Turkish+Online+Journal+of+Educational+Technology&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/";ProQuest Central,SciTech Premium Collection,Social Science Premium Collection
Enabling Problem Based Learning through Web 2.0 Technologies: PBL 2.0;"Advances in Information and Communications Technology (ICT), particularly the so-called Web 2.0, are affecting all aspects of our life: How we communicate, how we shop, how we socialise, how we learn. Facilitating learning through the use of ICT, also known as eLearning, is a vital part of modern educational systems. Established pedagogical strategies, such as Problem Based Learning (PBL), are being adapted for online use in conjunction with modern Web 2.0 technologies and tools. However, even though Web 2.0 and progressive social-networking technologies are automatically associated with ideals such as collaboration, sharing, and active learning, it is also possible to use them in a very conservative, teacher-centred way limiting thus their impact. In this paper, we present PBL 2.0 framework, i.e., a framework combining PBL practices with Web 2.0 technologies. More specifically, we (a) explain the theoretical considerations and construct the PBL 2.0 framework; (b) develop a learning platform to support the PBL 2.0 framework approach; and (c) apply PBL 2.0 in a real-world setting for lecturing University students. Pilot results are encouraging as overall satisfaction with the developed platform and good acceptance of the new learning practices is observed. Although the full potential of PBL 2.0 could not be achieved due to different institutional and cultural obstacles, authors believe that PBL 2.0 framework provides good guidance for designing and implementing a PBL course.";1287025375;;;Scholarly Journals;;"Tambouris, Efthimios;Panopoulou, Eleni;Tarabanis, Konstantinos;Ryberg, Thomas;Buus, Lillian;Peristeras, Vassilios;Lee, Deirdre;Porwol, Lukasz";;;; © 2012.

Peer Evaluation in Blended Team Project-Based Learning: What Do Students Find Important?;Team project-based learning is reputed to be an appropriate way to activate interactions among students and to encourage knowledge building through collaborative learning. Peer evaluation is an effective way for each student to participate actively in a team project. This article investigates the issues that are important to students when evaluating their peers in team project-based learning. A message analysis framework was inductively derived for the study, and data collected from the team-project learning process were categorized within this framework. Each message type was analyzed with respect to the students’ peer evaluation results. The results showed that managerial, procedural, and social messages, rather than academic messages, significantly predicted peer evaluation results. These results indicate that students find social contributions, such as organizing or coordinating managerial abilities, more important than cognitive contributions when they evaluate peers. Additional results and the significance of their implications are discussed.;1287025373;;;Scholarly Journals;;"Lee, Hye-Jung;Lim, Cheolil";;;; © 2012.

Using Online Lectures to Make Time for Active Learning;  To make time in class for group activities devoted to critical thinking, we integrated a series of short online lectures into the homework assignments of a large, introductory biology course at a research university. The majority of students viewed the online lectures before coming to class and reported that the online lectures helped them to complete the in-class activity and did not increase the amount of time they devoted to the course. In addition, students who viewed the online lecture performed better on clicker questions designed to test lower-order cognitive skills. The in-class activities then gave the students practice analyzing the information in groups and provided the instructor with feedback about the students' understanding of the material. On the basis of the results of this study, we support creating hybrid course models that allow students to learn the fundamental information outside of class time, thereby creating time during the class period to be dedicated toward the conceptual understanding of the material.

Examining competence factors that encourage innovative behaviour by European higher education graduate professionals;  Purpose - This paper aims to examine the effects of individual competencies and characteristics linked to educational programmes that contribute to the development of competencies conducive to innovation. Design/methodology/approach - The authors draw on theories of intrapreneurial competencies - i.e. intrapreneurship and competence-based innovation - and the entrepreneurship education literature. The study uses comprehensive survey data on approximately 11,000 higher education graduates, five years after graduation in 12 European countries, collected in 2005. The authors test hypotheses regarding the effects of individual competencies and study programme characteristics on the probability of introducing innovations at work, using logistic regression. Findings - Several kinds of competencies are found to increase the probability that graduates introduce innovations at work: professional and creative, communications and championing, and brokering do so, while productivity/efficiency does not. Education programmes emphasising the development of entrepreneurial skills and problem-based learning also promote innovation. Graduates in engineering are particularly innovative, whereas business and administration graduates are least innovative. Research limitations/implications - The central implication is that intrapreneurial competencies are learnable. The results refer specifically to higher educated persons, five years after graduation. Practical implications - Organisations that aim at stimulating employee-driven innovation need to emphasise the development of intrapreneurial, and especially, brokering competencies. Higher education institutions should put more emphasis on the development of entrepreneurial competencies, for example through problem-based learning. Originality/value - The study makes an empirical contribution to theories of intrapreneurship and competency-based innovation, by examining a wide range of competencies that promote innovation by graduate professionals in Europe.;1034101911;;;Scholarly Journals;;"Bjornali, Ekaterina S;Støren, Liv Anne";;;; Copyright Emerald Group Publishing Limited 2012; 10.1108/14626001211250135; Feature;;; 2012;;1462-6004;3; English;;; 402-423; Bradford;2012;Journal of Small Business and Enterprise Development;;2012;;;19;https://search.proquest.com/docview/1034101911?accountid=11774; 9520 Small business , 9130 Experimental/theoretical , 8306 Schools and educational services; 9520 Small business , 9130 Experimental/theoretical , 8306 Schools and educational services;; 9520 Small business , 9130 Experimental/theoretical , 8306 Schools and educational services;; 402; 9520 Small business , 9130 Experimental/theoretical , 8306 Schools and educational services;; Studies , Innovations , Entrepreneurs , Behavior , Gender , Hypotheses , Employees , Entrepreneurship , Risk aversion , Variables , Technological change , Higher education;;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aabiglobal&amp;atitle=Examining+competence+factors+that+encourage+innovative+behaviour+by+European+higher+education+graduate+professionals&amp;title=Journal+of+Small+Business+and+Enterprise+Development&amp;issn=14626004&amp;date=2012-07-01&amp;volume=19&amp;issue=3&amp;spage=402&amp;au=Bjornali%2C+Ekaterina+S%3BSt%C3%B8ren%2C+Liv+Anne&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=Journal+of+Small+Business+and+Enterprise+Development&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/10.1108%2F14626001211250135";ProQuest Central
Filling in the Distance Between Us: Group Metacognition During Problem Solving in a Secondary Education Course;While a body of research exists on individual metacognition, research on reflective communities is just beginning. This study generated a framework for conceptualizing metacognition in groups by describing likely components of group metacognition. I focused on a group of five preservice science teachers engaged in problem-based learning (PBL). The purpose of the PBL course was to help students gain useful concepts from the learning sciences to apply to teaching. I investigated forms of metacognition and the role reflective discourse played during the learning process. The group and facilitator were videotaped during PBL sessions. A segment of video to study further was identified through interaction analysis. I analyzed the discourse of this segment of the transcribed group discussion, and I examined the group’s final paper. Supplementary data sources included the interaction analysis transcript of the full 8-h videotape and, specifically, the comments the group made about the resources they used to solve the problem. Categories of group metacognition were identified, claims proposed, and recombined or rejected until saturation. I identified three components of group metacognition that helped the group members solve the instructional redesign problem: (1) metasocial awareness about other member’s expertise, (2) monitoring of understanding, and (3) monitoring of process. Future research directions and instructional implications are discussed.;2259584860;;;Scholarly Journals; Department of Learning, Teaching, & Curriculum, Department of Biochemistry, University of Missouri, Columbia, MO, USA;Siegel, Marcelle A;;;; Journal of Science Education and Technology is a copyright of Springer, (2011).

Supporting Online Group Projects1;"  Group work has been used to enhance student learning in online classrooms. It has been also found to create a sense of community, thereby contributing to increased learning and satisfaction. However, educators who work in online settings may struggle with how to effectively structure group projects to maximize the effectiveness of this teaching strategy. This paper focuses on specific teaching strategies the authors recommend to help facilitate successful group projects in online settings. These recommendations are based on the results of a research study conducted by the authors to explore ""How do students define their roles and responsibilities in online group projects?"" Results showed the difficulty students had with understanding how to make group projects work in an online setting and thus, specific strategies are recommended to support effective group work. These strategies include structured assignments to allow a climate of collaboration, use of preliminary assignments to help students understand group roles and styles, faculty and peer input into grade assignment for group projects, use of online tools to help gage group participation and determine additional intervention strategies when needed, and using a multi-stage process to help students solve problems that can arise during group work. Instructors need to be aware of the challenges specific to social task development and effectively use online platform tools, assignments and activities to scaffold and facilitate student learning and community building.

Comparing technology-related teacher professional development designs: a multilevel study of teacher and student impacts;This article presents a quasi-experimental study comparing the impact of two technology-related teacher professional development (TTPD) designs, aimed at helping junior high school science and mathematics teachers design online activities using the rapidly growing set of online learning resources available on the Internet. The first TTPD design (tech-only) focused exclusively on enhancing technology knowledge and skills for finding, selecting, and designing classroom activities with online resources, while the second (tech + pbl) coupled technology knowledge with learning to design problem-based learning (PBL) activities for students. Both designs showed large pre-post gains for teacher participants (N = 36) in terms of self-reported knowledge, skills, and technology integration. Significant interaction effects show that teachers in the tech + pbl group had larger gains for self-reported knowledge and externally rated use of PBL. Three generalized estimating equation (GEE) models were fit to study the impact on students' (N = 1,247) self reported gains in behavior, knowledge, and attitudes. In the resulting models, students of tech + pbl teachers showed significant increases in gain scores for all three outcomes. By contrast, students of tech-only teachers showed improved gains only in attitudes.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT];1013636768;;;Scholarly Journals;;"Walker, Andrew;Recker, Mimi;Ye, Lei;Robertshaw, M Brooke;Sellers, Linda;Leary, Heather";;;; Association for Educational Communications and Technology 2012; 10.1007/s11423-012-9243-8; Feature;;; Jun 2012;;1042-1629;3; English; English;; 421-444; New York;Jun 2012;Educational Technology, Research and Development;;2012;;;60;https://search.proquest.com/docview/1013636768?accountid=11774;;; References;;; 421;;; Professional development , Educational technology , Learning , Teaching methods;;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Apsychology&amp;atitle=Comparing+technology-related+teacher+professional+development+designs%3A+a+multilevel+study+of+teacher+and+student+impacts&amp;title=Educational+Technology%2C+Research+and+Development&amp;issn=10421629&amp;date=2012-06-01&amp;volume=60&amp;issue=3&amp;spage=421&amp;au=Walker%2C+Andrew%3BRecker%2C+Mimi%3BYe%2C+Lei%3BRobertshaw%2C+M+Brooke%3BSellers%2C+Linda%3BLeary%2C+Heather&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=Educational+Technology%2C+Research+and+Development&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/10.1007%2Fs11423-012-9243-8";ProQuest Central,Social Science Premium Collection
Leveraging learning technologies for collaborative writing in an online pharmacotherapy course;  The purpose of this project was to evaluate the development and delivery of a hypertext case scenario document to be used as the capstone assessment tool for doctoral-level physical therapy students. The integration of Web-based collaborative tools (PBworks(TM) and Google Sites(TM)) allowed students in this all-online course to apply their pharmacotherapy knowledge in a physical therapy patient scenario, while working with colleagues to determine the best route of patient care. Students developed digital writing skills imperative to a patient-centered, collaborative health-care field, and practiced evidence-based patient care. The findings demonstrate that the implementation of collaborative digital writing with a hypertext document case scenario assessment as the primary assessment tool in this online pharmacotherapy course delivered to doctoral-level physical therapy students is a feasible and effective educational strategy.

Framework for Implementing Engineering Senior Design Capstone Courses and Design Clinics;Senior design capstone projects for engineering students are essential components of an undergraduate program that enhances communication, teamwork and problem solving skills. Capstone projects with industry are well established in management, but not as heavily utilized in engineering. This paper outlines a general framework that can be used by students and faculty to create a strong, industry-based senior design capstone course. The framework has been established over the past 17 years at The University of Toledo College of Engineering and has been applied to over 90 projects in the Mechanical Engineering Department. This paper outlines the course framework, a discussion of the resources required, overviews of typical industry projects, a discussion of evaluation criteria, and a discussion of the benefits and challenges. In addition, commentary of students who have completed the course is included.

Behind the Final Grade in Hybrid v. Traditional Courses: Comparing Student Performance by Assessment Type, Core Competency, and Course Objective;There are many different delivery methods used by institutions of higher education. These include traditional, hybrid, and online course offerings. The comparisons of these typically use final grade as the measure of student performance. This research study looks behind the final grade and compares student performance by assessment type, core competency, and course objective. The statistical conclusions showed that hybrid course delivery could produce similar if not better results than traditional delivery. In addition, students performed significantly higher in assignments, critical thinking, written communications, and the advanced course objectives. Surprisingly, there appeared to be little if any impact on group projects and teamwork skills in the hybrid sections. Therefore, this study supports the hybrid delivery method for courses with similar course components.;1895977859; EJ1136737;;Scholarly Journals;;Bain, Lisa Z.;;;;;; Article , Report , Undefined , 080: Journal Articles , 143: Reports - Research , 160: Tests/Questionnaires; 1545-679X;; Feb 2012;;;1; English; English;; 47-60;;Feb 2012;Information Systems Education Journal; Scholarly Journals , Reports , Other Sources;2012; http://isedj.org; ERIC, © Information Systems and Computing Academic Professionals;10;https://search.proquest.com/docview/1895977859?accountid=11774;;;;;; 47;;;  4459ER5  4444 ,  1063ER5 10664ER5 3241ER5 6603ER5  1060 10621 3227 6582 ,  2222ER5 10664ER5 3241ER5 6603ER5  2211 10621 3227 6582 ,  1966ER5 3643ER5 6603ER5  1955 3629 6582 ,  10247ER5 3640ER5  10205 3626 ,  1981ER5 1ER5  1970 1 ,  2355ER5 7256ER5  2344 7230 ,  2065ER5 5172ER5 8290ER5 3164ER5  2054 5155 8260 3150 ,  5184ER5  5167 ,  1815ER5 10321ER5 8043ER5 4558ER5  1806 10278 8016 4542 ,  677ER5 5259ER5  675 5242 ,  4525ER5 126ER5  4509 126 ,  10282ER5 9179ER5 126ER5  10240 9146 126 ,  10833ER5 6468ER5  10789 6447 ,  2443ER5 1719ER5  2432 1710 ,  11660ER5 6120ER5 5771ER5  11614 5752 6101 ,  10685ER5 4527ER5 912ER5  10642 4511 909; Higher Education , Postsecondary Education;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aeric&amp;atitle=Behind+the+Final+Grade+in+Hybrid+v.+Traditional+Courses%3A+Comparing+Student+Performance+by+Assessment+Type%2C+Core+Competency%2C+and+Course+Objective&amp;title=Information+Systems+Education+Journal&amp;issn=1545-679X&amp;date=2012-02-01&amp;volume=10&amp;issue=1&amp;spage=47&amp;au=Bain%2C+Lisa+Z.&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=Information+Systems+Education+Journal&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/EJ1136737&amp;rft_id=info:doi/";Social Science Premium Collection
Designing the Research Commons: Classical Models for School Libraries;"School libraries and media centers today are embracing the idea of the ""learning commons,"" an approach to learning which makes use of the facility's physical openness and group meeting places to facilitate current shifts towards computer-based resource sharing and collaborative student projects. How can libraries yet to make this transition reverse a prior, mid-twentieth-century architectural bent toward segmentation of school library resources from the surrounding institution, and implement a more inclusive school library design? The open library paradigm is shown to represent a return to the principles of the earliest democratic libraries and repositories in the Western tradition. A qualitative metasynthesis of both the literature of library architecture and of the history of school libraries was undertaken in order to increase librarians' awareness of classical forms which influence design decisions into the twenty-first century.

Multi-Disciplinary Learning through a Database Development Project;Recently, there are many good examples of how multi-disciplinary learning can support students to learn collaboratively and not solely focus on a single professional sector. During the Fall 2011 and Spring 2012 semesters, we have attempted to gather students studying different professional domains together. Students from the Department of Computing (COMP) and the School of Hotel and Tourism Management (SHTM) are involved as partners and team members to work on joint student projects. One group of SHTM students is planning a conference event in 2012 with over 300 guests. These students act as the clients who require a banquet management system as well as a delegates managing application. Another group of SHTM students is to manage the development projects with the support of IT consultants who are in fact the COMP students. During the Fall semester, different communication channels have been set up to facilitate the inter-group and intra-group communications with the support offered by an e-learning system, Blackboard. Furthermore, there are classroom presentations given by the SHTM students and prototype demonstrations prepared by the COMP students. Pre-project and post-project questionnaires have been given to all participating students in order to assess their gain in professional and business knowledge in 2 different areas, namely database application development and conference management. During the Spring semester, another group of COMP students continued the development and made the 2 systems available on the Web. The two systems were used in a real conference and have received many positive feedbacks. In this paper, we would like to report the group dynamics of our students, achievement and difficulties encountered in this multi-disciplinary project.

Instructional Approaches on Science Performance, Attitude and Inquiry Ability in a Computer-Supported Collaborative Learning Environment;This study examined the effects of an inquiry-based learning (IBL) approach compared to that of a problem-based learning (PBL) approach on learner performance, attitude toward science and inquiry ability. Ninety-six students from three 7th-grade classes at a public school were randomly assigned to two experimental groups and one control group. All groups received the same web-based curriculum on the scientific topic of the greenhouse effect. These IBL groups, though, were asked to actively participate in the processes of predicting, hypothesizing, and testing, while the PBL groups were instructed to follow a specific problem-solving process. The results revealed that all students performed equally in science performance despite of the treatment groups. In terms of attitude toward science, the findings indicated that students participated in IBL or PBL groups reported more positive attitudes toward learning science and resulted in higher inquiry abilities than those who were in the control group. This study concerns itself with the features of the experimental treatment that may have contributed to these results, the implications of which are also considered.;1288341657;;;Scholarly Journals;;"CHEN, Ching-Huei;CHEN, Chia-Ying";;;; Copyright Sakarya University 2012;; Journal Article;;; 2012;;;1; English;;; n/a; Adapazari;2012;TOJET : The Turkish Online Journal of Educational Technology;;2012;;;11;https://search.proquest.com/docview/1288341657?accountid=11774;;;;;; n/a;;; Science education , Attitudes , Computers , Collaboration , Learning , Problem based learning , Computer assisted instruction--CAI , Cooperative learning , Greenhouse effect , Problem solving , Attitudes , Curricula , Collaborative virtual environments , Elementary education , Teaching methods , Learning environment , Attitudes , Problem solving , Students , Taiwan;;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aeducation&amp;atitle=Instructional+Approaches+on+Science+Performance%2C+Attitude+and+Inquiry+Ability+in+a+Computer-Supported+Collaborative+Learning+Environment&amp;title=TOJET+%3A+The+Turkish+Online+Journal+of+Educational+Technology&amp;issn=&amp;date=2012-01-01&amp;volume=11&amp;issue=1&amp;spage=&amp;au=CHEN%2C+Ching-Huei%3BCHEN%2C+Chia-Ying&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=TOJET+%3A+The+Turkish+Online+Journal+of+Educational+Technology&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/";ProQuest Central,SciTech Premium Collection,Social Science Premium Collection

The Impact of Problem-Based Learning (PBL) on Student Attitudes Toward Science, Problem-Solving Skills, and Sense of Community in the Classroom;  Problem-based learning (PBL) is a constructivist pedagogical approach to learning in which students work together to find solutions to a complex problem. This study used a mixed-method approach to examine the impact of PBL on student attitudes toward science, problem-solving skills and their perceptions of the learning environment. Forty-eight students in three regular high school chemistry classes participated in the study. Results based on student answers to a survey questionnaire, journal entries, approaches to solving a problem, and teacher classroom observations indicated a significant increase in student attitudes toward science, problem-solving skills and positive views of the learning environment. The use of PBL also facilitated the development of a sense of community in the classroom.

Self-Efficacy for Cross-Disciplinary Learning in Project-Based Teams;"  While research indicates that self-efficacy is related to learning on discrete tasks, less is known about self-efficacy for learning in complex, ill-structured learning environments. A measure of self-efficacy for design teams provides grounding for the design of learning support. This study aims to determine the usefulness of a measure of self-efficacy for cross-disciplinary team learning (CDTL) within a multi-disciplinary, project based setting. Research questions include: (1) Does student efficacy for CDTL change over the course of the semester? (2) What is the effect of (a) task complexity, (b) prior learner experience; (c) team composition; and (d) personal factors on efficacy for CDTL? Efficacy for CDTL while working on multi-disciplinary team projects was assessed using a 16-item Self-efficacy for CDTL scale. A total of 112 undergraduates from 34 teams in a service learning program completed both pre and post project questionnaires. A statistically significant increase in pre-post semester self-efficacy was found across three team learning factors: identification, recognition, and integration. Individual GPA and year in college were related to higher levels of improvement in the identification factor, while the completion of multiple design phases in team tasks was related to lower levels of improvement in the identification factor. This study contributes to our knowledge of individual self-efficacy and the design of learning environments involving multi-disciplinary teams. It is an important step toward the development of theory and evidence that can help higher educational institutions to better understand if and how students learn to collaborate while working on team design projects.";1014006072;;;Scholarly Journals;;"Schaffer, Scott P;Chen, Xiaojun;Zhu, Xiumei;Oakes, William C"; JEEDEQ;;; Copyright AMERICAN SOCIETY FOR ENGINEERING EDUCATION Jan 2012;; Feature;;; Jan 2012;;1069-4730;1; English; English;; 82-94; Washington;Jan 2012;Journal of Engineering Education;;2012;;;101;https://search.proquest.com/docview/1014006072?accountid=11774;;; Tables , References;;; 82;;; Studies , College students , School environment , Core curriculum , Behavior , Design , Influence , Foreign language learning;;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aeducation&amp;atitle=Self-Efficacy+for+Cross-Disciplinary+Learning+in+Project-Based+Teams&amp;title=Journal+of+Engineering+Education&amp;issn=10694730&amp;date=2012-01-01&amp;volume=101&amp;issue=1&amp;spage=82&amp;au=Schaffer%2C+Scott+P%3BChen%2C+Xiaojun%3BZhu%2C+Xiumei%3BOakes%2C+William+C&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=Journal+of+Engineering+Education&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/";ProQuest Central,SciTech Premium Collection,Social Science Premium Collection
A Toolkit for Web-Based Course Creation and Conversion;"Web-based instruction is not a new phenomenon. There are 15-20 years of research and literature to support the effectiveness of web-based instruction. The purpose of this article is to synthesize the research in this field in order to determine which factors are critical to the success of web-based instruction. We created a toolkit to assist instructors in creating web-based instruction. First, we attest that one must be aware of web-based students' performance. Second, social presence should be established through discussion forums and collaborative activities. Third, teacher presence should be moderated. Fourth, web-based courses should base course content in project-based learning activities. Fifth, a web-based instructor must provide optimal feedback. Empirical evidence is cited to support each of the five ""tools.""

Influences of Teaching Approaches and Class Size on Undergraduate Mathematical Learning;  An issue for many mathematics departments is the success rate of precalculus students. In an effort to increase the success rate, this quantitative study investigated how class size and teaching approach influenced student achievement and students' attitudes towards learning mathematics. Students' achievement and their attitudes toward learning mathematics were compared across four treatments of a precalculus course. The four treatments were (a) traditional lecture-based structure, (b) traditional lecture- based structure with a reduced class size, (c) instruction that engaged students in problem solving, and (d) instruction that included opportunities for small collaborative groups. The achievement of students engaged in problem-based learning (PBL) was significantly higher than the other treatments. These findings suggest that undergraduates benefit from instruction that encourages reflection on prior knowledge while developing new ideas through problem solving. Surprisingly, students in the PBE treatment did not continue to outperform students in the other treatments in calculus. These findings suggest the need for longitudinal studies that investigate the long-term effect of teaching approach and small class size on student learning and student success in advanced mathematics courses.

Pedagogical Uses of Technology in Physical Education;"  The primary goals of the program are to (1) provide preservice teachers with an opportunity to experience problem-based learning that requires the training in and application of several digital instructional tools, including data collection devices and multimedia applications; (2) engage preservice teachers in authentic discussion about the pedagogical uses of digital tools; and (3) explore new instructional models that provide technical and instructional support throughout the process of integrating curriculum and technology. Since knowledge is an essential element in making proper decisions regarding the implementation of new technologies in education, teacher preparation programs should focus on the development of preservice teachers' knowledge of the subject matter in conjunction with how best to structure and support their teaching and learning activities with technology.";903536104;;;Scholarly Journals;;Juniu, Susana;;;; Copyright American Alliance for Health, Physical Education and Recreation Nov/Dec 2011;; Feature;;; Nov/Dec 2011;;0730-3084;9; English; English;; 41-49; Reston;Nov/Dec 2011;Journal of Physical Education, Recreation & Dance;;2011;;;82;https://search.proquest.com/docview/903536104?accountid=11774;;; Tables , References;;; 41;;; Physical fitness , Teaching methods , Teacher education , Physical education teachers , Learning , Data collection , Heart rate , Educational technology , Skills;;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aeducation&amp;atitle=Pedagogical+Uses+of+Technology+in+Physical+Education&amp;title=Journal+of+Physical+Education%2C+Recreation+%26+Dance&amp;issn=07303084&amp;date=2011-11-01&amp;volume=82&amp;issue=9&amp;spage=41&amp;au=Juniu%2C+Susana&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=Journal+of+Physical+Education%2C+Recreation+%26+Dance&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/";Art, Design & Architecture Collection,ProQuest Central,Social Science Premium Collection
Key Determinants Of Student Satisfaction When Undertaking Group Work;The increasing popularity of team structures in business environment coupled with the common practice of including group projects/assignments in university curricula means that business schools should direct efforts towards maximizing team as well as personal results. Yet, most frameworks for studying teams center exclusively on team level outcomes to address organizational needs. Far fewer studies have examined effectiveness at individual team member level in an educational context. The quantitative study on which this paper is based investigated the impact of team process on the effectiveness of individual satisfaction in group work amongst business students in Hong Kong with work group effectiveness and management educational literature providing the theoretical background. The study surveyed 489 university business students and revealed that all three team process factors, namely workload sharing, mutual support and communication play a positive and significant role in individual satisfaction in team settings.

Group projects in teaching microcontrollers;  This paper describes a course on microcontrollers, in which the principal learning activity happens in small group projects. The course design includes some unusual solutions, such as a group and project lottery, or the inter- and intra-group peer assessment scheme. The details of the design of the course are presented, together with some variations tried. Some reflections are offered on the choices made, and some ways in which this teaching format may be improved have been suggested. The experiences with this course have been positive, and group projects can be recommended without reserve to all courses on this and similar subjects.

Redesigning a curriculum for inquiry: an ecology case study;  This article reports on an interdisciplinary ecology degree that was redesigned to provide more research activity for undergraduates. A case study approach explored how the teaching team constructed a curriculum that used inquiry activities. The development of an inquiry curriculum was enabled by a University audit focusing on the links between teaching and research, a Programme Review that signalled a need for change, and a Programme Director and group of academics committed to change. In addition, curriculum planning discussions were facilitated by an academic staff developer, who developed a shared vision for an inquiry approach during extended conversations amongst the planning group. Consequently, the new programme progressively develops inquiry skills in four out of five core courses (papers/modules). At stages 1 and 2, structured, guided and open inquiry activities lead to an open inquiry capstone course at stage 3.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT];881354588;;;Scholarly Journals;;"Spronken-smith, R A;Walker, R;Dickinson, K J; M;Closs, G P;Lord, J M;Harland, T"; INLSBJ;;; Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2011; 10.1007/s11251-010-9150-5; Feature;;; Sep 2011;;0020-4277;5; English; English;; 721-735; Dordrecht;Sep 2011;Instructional Science;;2011;;;39;https://search.proquest.com/docview/881354588?accountid=11774;;;;;; 721;;;;;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aeducation&amp;atitle=Redesigning+a+curriculum+for+inquiry%3A+an+ecology+case+study&amp;title=Instructional+Science&amp;issn=00204277&amp;date=2011-09-01&amp;volume=39&amp;issue=5&amp;spage=721&amp;au=Spronken-smith%2C+R+A%3BWalker%2C+R%3BDickinson%2C+K+J%3B+M%3BCloss%2C+G+P%3BLord%2C+J+M%3BHarland%2C+T&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=Instructional+Science&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/10.1007%2Fs11251-010-9150-5";ProQuest Central,Social Science Premium Collection

How do students define their roles and responsibilities in online learning group projects?;  The goal of this study was to explore the processes of group role formation in online class settings. Qualitative analysis was used to code chat logs and discussion threads in six undergraduate Family and Consumer Sciences online courses that required online group projects. Four themes related to the process of group role formation emerged: testing the waters, apologies as being nice, tag - you're it, and struggling to find one's role. Students created roles of leader, wannabe, spoiler, agreeable enabler, coat-tails, and supportive worker as the group process evolved over the course of the semester. Results lend support for a balance between allowing students to create and experience roles on their own and faculty assignment of roles. Questions are raised related to faculty approaches toward directing and scaffolding the group process.

The impact of problem-based learning strategies on STEM knowledge integration and attitudes: an exploratory study among female Taiwanese senior high school students;"  This study was designed to explore the effects of problem-based learning (PBL) strategies on the attitudes of female senior high school students toward integrated knowledge learning in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM). Content analysis and focus group methods were adopted as the research processes. Data and information about the STEM internet platform, an attitude scale and the contents of interviews were also collected for analysis. The subjects were 10th grade students at a girls' senior high school who volunteered to organize teams for a Solar Electric Trolley Contest. A total of 40 students were grouped into 18 teams. The results of the study indicate: (1) that PBL strategies can be helpful in enhancing students' attitudes toward STEM learning and the exploration of future career choices; (2) that the PBL teaching strategy helped to lead students step by step toward completing the contest's mission and to experience the meaning of integrated STEM knowledge; (3) that not only that students can actively apply engineering and science knowledge, but also that students tend to gain more solid science and mathematics knowledge through STEM learning in PBL; and (4) that PBL can enhance students' abilities and provide them experiences related to knowledge integration and application. Therefore, it is recommended that the curriculum at the girls' senior high school include more content related to specialty subjects to enhance their technological capabilities. In addition, a learning mechanism should be offered to aid advisers or teachers in strengthening students' integrated and systematic knowledge about STEM.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]";861392736;;;Scholarly Journals;;"Lou, Shi-jer;Shih, Ru-chu;Ray Diez, C;Tseng, Kuo-hung";;;; Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2011; 10.1007/s10798-010-9114-8; Feature;;; May 2011;;0957-7572;2; English; English;; 195-215; Dordrecht;May 2011;International Journal of Technology and Design Education;;2011;;;21;https://search.proquest.com/docview/861392736?accountid=11774;;; References;;; 195;;; Learning , Technology education , Student attitudes , Secondary school students , Instructional design;;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aeducation&amp;atitle=The+impact+of+problem-based+learning+strategies+on+STEM+knowledge+integration+and+attitudes%3A+an+exploratory+study+among+female+Taiwanese+senior+high+school+students&amp;title=International+Journal+of+Technology+and+Design+Education&amp;issn=09577572&amp;date=2011-05-01&amp;volume=21&amp;issue=2&amp;spage=195&amp;au=Lou%2C+Shi-jer%3BShih%2C+Ru-chu%3BRay+Diez%2C+C%3BTseng%2C+Kuo-hung&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=International+Journal+of+Technology+and+Design+Education&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/10.1007%2Fs10798-010-9114-8";Art, Design & Architecture Collection,ProQuest Central,SciTech Premium Collection,Social Science Premium Collection
Problem-based Learning: Influence on Students' Learning in an Electrical Engineering Course;  Recently, there has been a shift from using lecture-based teaching methods in undergraduate engineering courses to using more learner-centered teaching approaches, such as problem-based learning. However, research on the impact of these approaches has mainly involved student perceptions of the teaching method and anecdotal and opinion pieces by faculty on their use of the teaching method, rather than empirically collected data on students' learning outcomes. This paper describes an investigation of the impact of problem-based learning (PBL) on undergraduate electrical engineering students' conceptual understanding and their perceptions of learning using PBL as compared to lecture. Fifty-five students enrolled in an electrical engineering course at a Midwestern university participated in this research. The study utilized a within-subjects A-B-A-B research design with traditional lecture as the baseline phase and problem-based learning as the experimental phase of the study. Participants completed pre- and post-tests surrounding the four topics covered in the study and also completed a Student Assessment of Learning Gains (SALG) survey. Results suggested participants' learning gains from PBL were twice their gains from traditional lecture. Even though students learned more from PBL, students thought they learned more from traditional lecture. We discuss these findings and offer implications for faculty interested in implementing PBL. Given the limited research on the beneficial effects of PBL on student learning, this study provides empirical support for PBL. We discuss findings from this study and provide specific implications for faculty and researchers interested in problem-based learning in engineering.;873571059;;;Scholarly Journals;;"Yadav, Aman;Subedi, Dipendra;Lundeberg, Mary A;Bunting, Charles F"; JEEDEQ;;; Copyright AMERICAN SOCIETY FOR ENGINEERING EDUCATION Apr 2011;; Feature;;; Apr 2011;;1069-4730;2; English; English;; 253-280; Washington;Apr 2011;Journal of Engineering Education;;2011;;;100;https://search.proquest.com/docview/873571059?accountid=11774;;; Graphs , Tables , References;;; 253;;; Learning , Electrical engineering , Teaching methods , College students , Higher education , Mathematical models;;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aeducation&amp;atitle=Problem-based+Learning%3A+Influence+on+Students%27+Learning+in+an+Electrical+Engineering+Course&amp;title=Journal+of+Engineering+Education&amp;issn=10694730&amp;date=2011-04-01&amp;volume=100&amp;issue=2&amp;spage=253&amp;au=Yadav%2C+Aman%3BSubedi%2C+Dipendra%3BLundeberg%2C+Mary+A%3BBunting%2C+Charles+F&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=Journal+of+Engineering+Education&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/";ProQuest Central,SciTech Premium Collection,Social Science Premium Collection
"Reflections on iCODE: using web technology and hands-on projects to engage urban youth in computer science and&amp;#xa0;engineering";More than 200 middle school and high school students from underserved urban communities in Boston, Lowell, and Lawrence, Massachusetts, participated in after-school and summer enrichment programs over a three-year period, using hands-on learning materials and web resources to complete hands-on microcontroller-based projects. Program content was based on a suite of robotics and electronics kits developed by the University of Massachusetts Lowell and Machine Science Inc., together with on-line instructions, a web-based programming tool, and a shared electronic portfolio of student projects. Participating students worked with classroom teachers and undergraduate mentors to complete a series of projects, and took part each year in a non-competitive robotics exhibition and a competitive robot sumo tournament. Goodman Research Group assessed learning outcomes and attitudinal changes using a variety of measures, including observations of program sessions, group interviews with participating students, pre- and post-program student surveys, and educator feedback. The program was found to effectively engage participants, give them real engineering and programming skills, improve their attitudes toward science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) subjects, and increase their interest in STEM career pathways. These results are presented, along with lessons learned from the program implementation, technology development, and evaluation.;853676031;;;Scholarly Journals; University of Massachusetts Lowell, Lowell, USA , University of Massachusetts Lowell, Lowell, USA , Machine Science Inc., Cambridge, USA , Machine Science Inc., Cambridge, USA , Goodman Research Group, Inc., Cambridge, USA , Goodman Research Group, Inc., Cambridge, USA , Goodman Research Group, Inc., Cambridge, USA;"Martin, Fred G;Scribner-MacLean, Michelle;Christy, Sam;Rudnicki, Ivan;Londhe, Rucha;Manning, Colleen;Goodman, Irene F";;;; Autonomous Robots is a copyright of Springer, (2011).

Exploring Impact of Self-Selected Student Teams and Academic Potential on Student Satisfaction;"Creation of teams in professional and student contexts has been well researched and written about. The research landscape can be divided into instructor selected and student selected teams, both of which have advantages and disadvantages. The purpose of this paper is to combine the two techniques for creating teams in an effort to maximize the advantages and minimize the disadvantages, all while achieving high student satisfaction. The paper explores a technique for creating student teams to maximize student satisfaction in a high pressure project using two antecedents: (i) prior academic performance in the same major and (ii) compliance with student's preferences for their peers. Student satisfaction is measured by a survey developed and used for a similar project (Mahenthiran &amp; Rouse, 2000). Results confirm that academic performance is a clear predictor of student satisfaction; however the act of students selecting their teammates has a very small impact in their level of satisfaction in the team. The causes of this outcome are discussed along with a few limitations of the study and implications.";1941335224; EJ1145465;;Scholarly Journals;;"Matta, Vic;Luce, Thom;Ciavarro, Gina";;;;;; Article , Report , Undefined , 080: Journal Articles , 143: Reports - Research , 160: Tests/Questionnaires; 1545-679X;; Apr 2011;;;1; English; English;; 14-23;;Apr 2011;Information Systems Education Journal; Scholarly Journals , Reports , Other Sources;2011; http://isedj.org; ERIC, © Information Systems and Computing Academic Professionals;9;https://search.proquest.com/docview/1941335224?accountid=11774;;;;;; 14;;;  10685ER5 4527ER5 912ER5  10642 4511 909 ,  26ER5 1ER5  26 1 ,  10219ER5 732ER5  10181 730 ,  7697ER5 8043ER5 4558ER5  7670 8016 4542 ,  10282ER5 9179ER5 126ER5  10240 9146 126 ,  8131ER5 732ER5  8102 730 ,  28ER5 96ER5  28 96 ,  8128ER5  8099 ,  1990ER5 2232ER5 912ER5  1979 2221 909 ,  4459ER5  4444 ,  6303ER5  6283 ,  5184ER5  5167 ,  2065ER5 5172ER5 8290ER5 3164ER5  2054 5155 8260 3150 ,  4467ER5 1815ER5 10321ER5 8043ER5 4558ER5  4452 1806 10278 8016 4542 ,  11139ER5 1815ER5 10321ER5 8043ER5 4558ER5  11095 1806 10278 8016 4542 ,  9404ER5 2584ER5  9370 2572 ,  10303ER5 10423ER5 3643ER5 6603ER5  10260 10380 3629 6582 ,  10125ER5 2586ER5 3643ER5 6603ER5  10087 2574 3629 6582; Higher Education , Postsecondary Education;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aeric&amp;atitle=Exploring+Impact+of+Self-Selected+Student+Teams+and+Academic+Potential+on+Student+Satisfaction&amp;title=Information+Systems+Education+Journal&amp;issn=1545-679X&amp;date=2011-04-01&amp;volume=9&amp;issue=1&amp;spage=14&amp;au=Matta%2C+Vic%3BLuce%2C+Thom%3BCiavarro%2C+Gina&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=Information+Systems+Education+Journal&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/EJ1145465&amp;rft_id=info:doi/";Social Science Premium Collection
Enhancing Team Projects Using an Event-Triggered Knowledge Network;Across the disciplines and levels of education, team projects are becoming an increasingly important tool for assessment. However, it is often difficult to make sure that work is fairly distributed, that a reasonable schedule is formed which does not leave everything for the last minute, and that individual students are fairly rewarded/penalized for their respective contributions. To solve these problems, we can model a project using events, rules, and workflows. Depending on the nature of an event, an appropriate rule can be triggered, which can subsequently initiate a workflow that will assign specific tasks to specific roles within the team. Events that occur over the course of the project, fired from a variety of sources, can lead to the derivation of new knowledge, and potentially alter the flow of the team’s activities. An integration of mobile devices into the system can insure that students are always aware of the current state of the system and their roles within it. At the conclusion and at all prior points in the project lifecycle, a comprehensive log of each student’s activities will be available and will greatly simplify the task of assigning fair and accurate grades. The result will be a more educational, more equitable, and far more engaging learning experience.;1955103779;;;Scholarly Journals;;"DePree, Jeff;Xiao, Xuelian;Su, Stanley Y W";;;;" (c) 2011 Jeff DePree, Xuelian Xiao, Stanley Y W Su.

An integrated approach to teaching and learning logistics: A case study;Business managers and students often criticise university teaching for not addressing real-life problems. Furthermore, professors are dissatisfied with the research capabilities of postgraduate students. This paper advocates an integrated approach to teaching and learning based on the features of project-based learning aimed at enhancing the practical and research skills of undergraduate students in Logistics. A case study is presented where third-year students were engaged in a real-life project in collaboration with industry, exposing them to collaborative learning, questionnaire design, surveys, analysing and evaluating results, literature review and report writing. The project was carried out in phases where students were assessed after each phase. The paper analyses the assessment of students and their perception of the value of the project. It is concluded that an integrated teaching and learning approach will increase students’ interest in the subject, understanding of theoretical concepts, research skills, business skills and life skills.;1898641280;;;Scholarly Journals;;Cronjé, Jacobus N;;;; Copyright AOSIS (Pty) Ltd 2011; 10.4102/jtscm.v5i1.21; Journal Article;;; 2011;;2310-8789;1; English; English;;; Johannesburg;2011;Journal of Transport and Supply Chain Management;;2011;;;5;https://search.proquest.com/docview/1898641280?accountid=11774;;;;;; n/a;;; Students , Collaboration , Skills , Case studies , Literature reviews , Logistics;;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aabiglobal&amp;atitle=An+integrated+approach+to+teaching+and+learning+logistics%3A+A+case+study&amp;title=Journal+of+Transport+and+Supply+Chain+Management&amp;issn=23108789&amp;date=2011-01-01&amp;volume=5&amp;issue=1&amp;spage=&amp;au=Cronj%C3%A9%2C+Jacobus+N&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=Journal+of+Transport+and+Supply+Chain+Management&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/10.4102%2Fjtscm.v5i1.21";ProQuest Central,SciTech Premium Collection
Hydrostatic Pressure Project: Linked-Class Problem-Based Learning In Engineering;  Over the last few years, WTAMU Mathematics, Engineering and Science faculty has used interdisciplinary projects as the basis for implementation of a linked-class approach to Problem-Based Learning (PBL). A project that has significant relevance to engineering statics, fluid mechanics, and calculus is the Hydrostatic Pressure Project. This project was developed by faculty associated with the NSF-funded INCRSE project, Increasing Numbers and Connections in Science, Math, and Engineering, for application of the linked-class PBL to calculus II and engineering statics. The students in the linked classes were to predict the horizontal force and the vertical force on a submerged surface and determine the appropriate locations of these forces in order to experimentally verify the calculations. They worked in groups to outline their procedures, develop their functional relations, record experimental data, and report on their findings. Assessment efforts have focused on student laboratory reports and student perceptions about their learning and experiences with this linked-class PBL project collected through surveys and focus groups. In all the surveys and focus groups conducted with students who had participated in the Hydrostatic Pressure Project, all of the students felt their experience was beneficial and had enhanced their understanding and applications of engineering and mathematics.;1822121601;;;Scholarly Journals;;"Davis, Freddie J;Lockwood-Cooke, Pamela;Hunt, Emily M";;;; Copyright The Clute Institute 2011; 10.19030/ajee.v2i1.4275; Journal Article;;; 2011;;2153-2516;1; English; English;;; Littleton;2011;American Journal of Engineering Education;;2011;;;2;https://search.proquest.com/docview/1822121601?accountid=11774;;;;;; n/a;;;; -based learning , engineering education , undergraduate project;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aengineeringjournals&amp;atitle=Hydrostatic+Pressure+Project%3A+Linked-Class+Problem-Based+Learning+In+Engineering&amp;title=American+Journal+of+Engineering+Education&amp;issn=21532516&amp;date=2011-01-01&amp;volume=2&amp;issue=1&amp;spage=&amp;au=Davis%2C+Freddie+J%3BLockwood-Cooke%2C+Pamela%3BHunt%2C+Emily+M&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=American+Journal+of+Engineering+Education&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/10.19030%2Fajee.v2i1.4275";ProQuest Central,SciTech Premium Collection

The effects of using problem-based learning in science and technology teaching upon students' academic achievement and levels of structuring concepts;"The present study aimed to investigate the impact of the problem-based learning method used in science and technology teaching upon elementary school students' construction levels for the concepts concerning the ""Systems in Our Body"" unit in the science and technology course and their academic achievement. To this end, during the four-week experimental application process, the course was taught using the problem-based learning method in the experimental group and the control group curriculum was only based on the science and technology textbook. The study used two groups including the experimental (n=20) and control (n=21) groups, and the study used the pretest posttest control group semi-experimental design. The analysis of the obtained data revealed a significant difference in favor of the experimental group on students' scores on the academic achievement test and the open-ended questions that identified their construction levels for the concepts. This study should guide further studies and to help determine the effectiveness of the method in question on elementary school students.";1955058854;;;Scholarly Journals; Usak University, Faculty of Education, Department of Science Education, Usak, TURKEY Email: dideminel@gmail.com , Dokuz Eylul University, Faculty of Education, Department of Science Education, Izmir, TURKEY;"Inel, Didem;Balim, Ali Günay";;;; Copyright The Education University of Hong Kong, Department of Science and Environmental Studies Dec 2010;; Journal Article;;; Dec 2010;;;2; English; English;; 1-23; Hong Kong;Dec 2010;Asia - Pacific Forum on Science Learning and Teaching;;2010;;;11;https://search.proquest.com/docview/1955058854?accountid=11774;;;;;; 1;;; International conferences , Cooperative learning , Teaching methods , Problems , Achievement tests , Concept mapping , Curricula , Science education , Academic achievement , Knowledge , Science teachers , Critical thinking , Cognitive ability , Problem based learning , Cognition & reasoning;;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aeducation&amp;atitle=The+effects+of+using+problem-based+learning+in+science+and+technology+teaching+upon+students%27+academic+achievement+and+levels+of+structuring+concepts&amp;title=Asia+-+Pacific+Forum+on+Science+Learning+and+Teaching&amp;issn=&amp;date=2010-12-01&amp;volume=11&amp;issue=2&amp;spage=1&amp;au=Inel%2C+Didem%3BBalim%2C+Ali+G%C3%BCnay&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=Asia+-+Pacific+Forum+on+Science+Learning+and+Teaching&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/";ProQuest Central,Social Science Premium Collection
A project-based competitive learning scheme to teach mobile communications;  This paper presents a project-based learning experience to teach mobile communications courses, carried out at Alcalá University, Madrid, Spain. The experience consists of a competition among teams formed by students, who act as consultant companies working for imaginary operators. The objective of the teams is to obtain the best network design and the most economical budget for an imaginary operator in the city of Alcalá de Henares. The proposed learning scheme uses existing concepts of different fields, such as the project-based or competitive games methodologies, and applies them to the teaching of telecommunications subjects. Details of the practical application of the methodology and results obtained at Alcalá University are discussed in this paper.

A Systematic Review of Developing Team Competencies in Information Systems Education;The ability to work effectively in teams has been a key competence for information systems engineers for a long time. Gradually, more attention is being paid to developing this generic competence as part of academic curricula, resulting in two questions: how to best promote team competencies and how to implement team projects successfully. These questions are closely interwoven and need to be looked at together. To address these questions, this paper identifies relevant studies and approaches, best practices, and key findings in the field of information systems education and related fields such as computer science and business, and examines them together to develop a systematic framework. The framework is intended to categorize existing research on teams and team competencies in information systems education and to guide information systems educators in supporting teamwork and promoting team competencies in students at the course and curricular level in the context of teaching in tertiary education.

Developing a problem-based learning (PBL) curriculum for professionalism and scientific integrity training for biomedical graduate students;"  A multidisciplinary faculty committee designed a curriculum to shape biomedical graduate students into researchers with a high commitment to professionalism and social responsibility and to provide students with tools to navigate complex, rapidly evolving academic and societal environments with a strong ethical commitment. The curriculum used problem-based learning (PBL), because it is active and learner-centred and focuses on skill and process development. Two courses were developed: Scientific Professionalism: Scientific Integrity addressed discipline-specific and broad professional norms and obligations for the ethical practice of science and responsible conduct of research (RCR). Scientific Professionalism: Bioethics and Social Responsibility focused on current ethical and bioethical issues within the scientific profession, and implications of research for society. Each small-group session examined case scenarios that included: (1) learning objectives for professional norms and obligations; (2) key ethical issues and philosophies within each topic area; (3) one or more of the RCR instructional areas; and (4) at least one type of moral reflection. Cases emphasised professional standards, obligations and underlying philosophies for the ethical practice of science, competing interests of stakeholders and oversight of science (internal and external). To our knowledge, this is the first use of a longitudinal, multi-semester PBL course to teach scientific integrity and professionalism.

Supporting distributed team working in 3D virtual worlds: a case study in Second Life;"Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to report on a study into how a three-dimensional (3D) virtual world (Second Life) can facilitate socialisation and team working among students working on a team project at a distance. This models the situation in many commercial sectors where work is increasingly being conducted across time zones and between multiple teams. Collaboration in these geographically distributed teams is virtual rather than through face-to-face interactions. The paper investigates how a virtual world such as Second Life compares to other collaboration tools such as instant messaging or Skype; and the challenges that students experience in becoming acquainted with and working in Second Life. Design/methodology/approach - The paper has employed a qualitative research methodology involving data collection through group interviews, epistolary (email) interviews and semi-structured individual interviews. The data have been analysed by applying the inductive analysis technique. Findings - The analysis is presented through answers to questions which educators may have about the effectiveness of virtual worlds in supporting collaboration in virtual teams. Research limitations/implications - The paper highlights the pedagogical role of 3D virtual worlds in supporting communication, team working and community building. The methodology will be of interest to researchers in the area of virtual worlds as there is little guidance in the literature about how to evaluate student experiences of these environments. Practical implications - The research reported in this paper is timely and significant in view of current business scenarios such as the challenges of a globally distributed work-place, the need to offer training to develop employees' skills of working in distributed environments and to meet changing market needs. Furthermore, the research will support the development of a coordinated response to the Leitch review of skills in the UK, which identified issues of resource-intensive travel, global warming and the need for businesses to be seen as ""green"" for customer attraction and retention. Originality/value - The paper discusses the role of 3D virtual worlds in supporting student team projects involving students who are geographically dispersed. The sense of visual presence and of place in a 3D world can make socialising in a virtual world, a more ""human"" experience than in 2D environments such as web sites, e-mail, wikis and blogs, and even phone or video-conferencing. The research reported in this paper could enhance uptake of 3D virtual worlds by organisations facing the challenges of facilitating socialisation and knowledge sharing in a distributed workforce.";1012765734;;;Scholarly Journals;;"Minocha, Shailey;Morse, David R";;" Linden Lab

Engaging Undergraduates to Solve Global Health Challenges: A New Approach Based on Bioengineering Design;"  Recent reports have highlighted the need for educational programs to prepare students for careers developing and disseminating new interventions that improve global public health. Because of its multi-disciplinary, design-centered nature, the field of Biomedical Engineering can play an important role in meeting this challenge. This article describes a new program at Rice University to give undergraduate students from all disciplines a broad background in bioengineering and global health and provides an initial assessment of program impact. Working in partnership with health care providers in developing countries, students in the Beyond Traditional Borders (BTB) initiative learn about health challenges of the poor and put this knowledge to work immediately, using the engineering design process as a framework to formulate solutions to complex global health challenges. Beginning with a freshman design project and continuing through a capstone senior design course, the BTB curriculum uses challenges provided by partners in the developing world to teach students to integrate perspectives from multiple disciplines, and to develop leadership, communication, and teamwork skills. Exceptional students implement their designs under the guidance of clinicians through summer international internships. Since 2006, 333 students have designed more than 40 technologies and educational programs; 28 have been implemented in sub-Saharan Africa, Latin America, the Caribbean, southeast Asia, and the United States. More than 18,000 people have benefited from these designs. 95% of alumni who completed an international internship reported that participation in the program changed or strengthened their career plans to include a focus on global health medicine, research, and/or policy. Empowering students to use bioengineering design to address real problems is an effective way to teach the new generation of leaders needed to solve global health challenges.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]";743961856; 20387116;;Scholarly Journals;;"Oden, Maria;Mirabal, Yvette;Epstein, Marc;Richards-kortum, Rebecca";;;; Biomedical Engineering Society 2010; 10.1007/s10439-010-0036-0; Journal Article;;; Sep 2010;;0090-6964;9; English; English;; 3031-41; New York;Sep 2010;Annals of Biomedical Engineering;;2010;;;38;https://search.proquest.com/docview/743961856?accountid=11774;;;;;; 3031;; Asia, Southeastern , Caribbean Region , Developing Countries , Female , Humans , Internship & Residency , Latin America , Leadership , Male , United States;;;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aengineeringjournals&amp;atitle=Engaging+Undergraduates+to+Solve+Global+Health+Challenges%3A+A+New+Approach+Based+on+Bioengineering+Design&amp;title=Annals+of+Biomedical+Engineering&amp;issn=00906964&amp;date=2010-09-01&amp;volume=38&amp;issue=9&amp;spage=3031&amp;au=Oden%2C+Maria%3BMirabal%2C+Yvette%3BEpstein%2C+Marc%3BRichards-kortum%2C+Rebecca&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=Annals+of+Biomedical+Engineering&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/20387116&amp;rft_id=info:doi/10.1007%2Fs10439-010-0036-0";ProQuest Central,SciTech Premium Collection
A study of the role of user-centered design methods in design team projects;  User-centered approaches to design can guide teams toward an understanding of users and aid teams in better posing design problems. This paper investigates the role of user-centered design approaches in design process and outcome within the context of design team projects. The value of interaction with users is examined at several stages throughout the design process. The influence of user-centered design on the performance of design teams is also explored. Results suggest that the quantity of interactions with users and time spent interacting with users alone is not linked with better design outcome, but that iterative evaluation of concepts by users may be of particular value to design prototypes. Suggestions are made based on the reflections from the authors after conducting this study.

Moral conflicts in project-based learning in ISD;"  The purpose of this paper is to increase understanding of moral conflicts in information systems development by studying student perceptions in an information systems (IS) project course implemented in close collaboration with information technology firms. The paper is based on an empirical case study. Students' perceptions of moral conflicts were gathered through diaries, drawings, and questionnaires; and the analysis was inspired by phenomenography. The analysis reveals six types of moral conflicts. Students face conflicts related to their work tasks and to human and outside parties, and inherent in them is an inclination to moral failure in terms of doing something they perceive to be morally wrong, and also the desire for moral success in resolving the conflicts as well as possible. Students practicing the project manager's job confronted the most difficult moral conflicts. The just IS student project community is suggested as a way of integrating ethics into IS education, and extending the research on moral conflicts to the business context is recommended. The paper offers two contributions. First, it develops the research on IS and project-based learning (PjBL) from a moral perspective and second, it facilitates ethics integration into IS education in the PjBL context.";750891082;;;Scholarly Journals;;Vartiainen, Tero;;;; Copyright Emerald Group Publishing Limited 2010; 10.1108/09593841011069167; Feature;;; 2010;;0959-3845;3; English;;; 265-280; West Linn;2010;Information Technology & People;;2010;;;23;https://search.proquest.com/docview/750891082?accountid=11774; 9175 Western Europe , 9130 Experimental/theoretical , 5240 Software & systems , 2500 Organizational behavior; 9175 Western Europe , 9130 Experimental/theoretical , 5240 Software & systems , 2500 Organizational behavior; References , Photographs , Tables; 9175 Western Europe , 9130 Experimental/theoretical , 5240 Software & systems , 2500 Organizational behavior;; 265; 9175 Western Europe , 9130 Experimental/theoretical , 5240 Software & systems , 2500 Organizational behavior;; International , Studies , Information systems , Learning , Ethics , Project management , Group dynamics , Systems development;;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aabiglobal&amp;atitle=Moral+conflicts+in+project-based+learning+in+ISD&amp;title=Information+Technology+%26+People&amp;issn=09593845&amp;date=2010-07-01&amp;volume=23&amp;issue=3&amp;spage=265&amp;au=Vartiainen%2C+Tero&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=Information+Technology+%26+People&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/10.1108%2F09593841011069167";ProQuest Central,SciTech Premium Collection,Social Science Premium Collection
Team Learning in Technology-Mediated Distributed Teams;This study examines technological, educational/learning, and social affordances associated with the facilitation of project-based learning and problem solving in technology-mediated distributed teams. An empirical interpretive research approach using direct observation is used to interpret, evaluate and rate observable manifested behaviors and qualitative content (i.e. discussions) associated with project-based team learning. The theory of affordances and social impact theory are integrated to develop a conceptual model that asserts that collaboration mode (collocated vs. non-collocated and videoconferencing supported) will dictate the quality of information exchange, progressive elaboration of ideas, and the social processes that influence team learning. Team learning is then suggested to yield better productivity and higher perceived interaction quality. Results showed that collaboration mode can impact team information exchange and interpretation and ultimately task outcomes. Further, collaboration mode can also create a social structure that influences the capacity for a team to maintain a mutual supportive and positive climate needed for successful project-based task outcomes. The results offer some extended insights into the technology-mediated collaborative learning process among students in a higher education context as well as in organizational settings. Theoretical, methodological and practical implications of the study are discussed.

Evaluating students' perceptions and attitudes toward computer-mediated project-based learning environment: A case study;This research investigated 68 secondary school students' perceptions of their computer-mediated project-based learning environment and their attitudes towards Project Work (PW) using two instruments--Project Work Classroom Learning Environment Questionnaire (PWCLEQ) and Project Work Related Attitudes Instrument (PWRAI). In this project-based learning environment, students experienced a face-to-face classroom setting and e-learning by using a synchronous computer-mediated communication (CMC) tool called 'iCollaborate' for online communication and project collaboration with peers from other countries. The PWCLEQ and PWRAI instruments were used to evaluate the computer-mediated project-based learning environment using students' perceptions of the learning environment and to further investigate how their perceptions might affect their attitudes towards PW lessons. Students perceived the computer-mediated project-based learning environment favourably but they preferred to experience more Material Environment and more Open-Endedness and Social Presence. Simple correlation analysis revealed that all environment dimensions were significantly and positively related to the students' attitudes towards PW, while multiple regression analysis indicated that two scales, Instructor Support and Social Presence, were the strongest predictors of attitudes towards PW lessons.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT];501355124;;;Scholarly Journals;;"Seet, Ling Ying; Britta;Quek, Choon Lang";;;; Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2010; 10.1007/s10984-010-9073-8; Feature;;; Jul 2010;;1387-1579;2; English; English;; n/a; Dordrecht;Jul 2010;Learning Environments Research;;2010;;;13;https://search.proquest.com/docview/501355124?accountid=11774;;; References;;; 173;;; Student attitudes , School environment , Computer assisted instruction--CAI , Secondary school students;;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Apsychology&amp;atitle=Evaluating+students%27+perceptions+and+attitudes+toward+computer-mediated+project-based+learning+environment%3A+A+case+study&amp;title=Learning+Environments+Research&amp;issn=13871579&amp;date=2010-07-01&amp;volume=13&amp;issue=2&amp;spage=173&amp;au=Seet%2C+Ling+Ying%3B+Britta%3BQuek%2C+Choon+Lang&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=Learning+Environments+Research&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/10.1007%2Fs10984-010-9073-8";ProQuest Central,Social Science Premium Collection
Developing Leadership Skills of Undergraduate Engineering Students: Perspectives from engineering faculty;The engineering education community (motivated by internal and external factors) has begun to focus on leadership abilities of college students in engineering fields via reports from ABET, the National Academy of Engineering, and the National Research Council. These reports have directed criticism toward higher education institutions for their lack of success in instilling leadership abilities within recent engineering graduates. Recognizing the importance of leadership development among undergraduate engineering students, researchers in the current study interviewed twelve engineering faculty at a Midwestern university about ways that leadership might be incorporated into engineering curricula given the current environment of engineering and engineering faculty's roles and responsibilities. An idea emerging from the interviews includes an integration of leadership topics into current courses and in capstone courses. Faculty also noted the importance of real-life experiences and extracurricular activities in students' leadership development. Additional barriers to incorporating leadership into undergraduate engineering experiences are discussed.

Spreading of project and virtual teams in traditional organizational cultures;  In our article we would like to give an overview of the recent literature about special present work arrangements emphasizing the differences between `traditional´ work and `(virtual) project team´ work.`Traditional work´ means that the employee has an invariable package of tasks that he/she is responsible for. In `project teams´ members have common complex goals and there are a lot of parts of assignments that one is responsible for in the team. `Project´ means that there is a specific exercise that must be carried out in defined time and budget. The nature of work is dynamically changing and there is a new view of work in project groups. There are different antecedences and emphasizes than in `traditional work´.There is a lot of information, and information acquisition is not a problem, but one has to be very clever to structure the abounding information he/she gets. Due to technical development,it is possible to work at home and people do not need to go out to work every day. Working together with others has also become special: you may not know personally the persons you work together with, you may have only virtual contact with them. The goals and the conditions of project team work are really special and it is important to know because more and more project groups are appearing. There are project groups appearing in Hungary also. According to the ``Collectively for Workplaces of the Future´´ Foundation´s (``Közösen a Jövõ Munkahelyeiért`` Alapítvány)competition in 2009 we began a research related to project works in Hungarian organizations. We tried to analyze project work as an atypical type of work and we tried to also analyze how it can be appropriate to make possibilities of labour market better and ensure flexible opportunities for organizations and individuals. We analyzed such Hungarian organizations,which have one or more project teams and we tried to reveal work psychological aspects of this type of work.;1629435068;;;Scholarly Journals;;"Répáczki, Rita;Juhász, Márta";;;; Copyright Periodica Polytechnica, Budapest University of Technology and Economics 2010; 10.3311/pp.so.2010-2.04; Journal Article;;; 2010;;1416-3837;2; English , German; German;; 87-98; Budapest;2010;Periodica Polytechnica.

Mobile-Device-Supported Problem-Based Computational Estimation Instruction for Elementary School Students;This study implemented a three-stage problem-based estimation instruction scenario and combined it with mobile technology to provide elementary teachers with an effective e-tool for observing student estimation and leading effective class or group discussions on the selection and assessment of appropriate strategies for solving daily estimation problems. Twenty-eight fourth graders were randomly sampled and assigned to two groups: the experimental group (problem-based estimation instruction using mobile devices) and the control group (problem-based estimation instruction without mobile devices). The analytical results demonstrated that problem-based estimation instruction could effectively help students learn computational estimation skills. Moreover, using mobile devices for problem-based computational estimation instruction appeared to help students discuss and cooperate with others, and moreover the mobile-device-supported problem-based estimation scenario helped students develop metacognition knowledge of estimation strategies.;1287030722;;;Scholarly Journals;;"Yu-Ju, Lan;Yao-Ting, Sung;Ning-chun, Tan;Chiu-Pin, Lin;Chang, Kuo-En";;;; © 2010.

Effects of Problem-Based Learning on University Students’ Epistemological Beliefs About Physics and Physics Learning and Conceptual Understanding of Newtonian Mechanics;"This study investigated the effects of problem-based learning on students’ beliefs about physics and physics learning and conceptual understanding of Newtonian mechanics. The study further examines the relationship between students’ beliefs about physics and their conceptual understanding of mechanics concepts. Participants were 124 Turkish university students (PBL&#xa0;=&#xa0;55, traditional&#xa0;=&#xa0;69) enrolled in a calculus-based introductory physics class. Students’ beliefs about physics and physics learning and their physics conceptual understanding were measured with the Colorado Learning Attitudes about Science Survey (CLASS) and the Force Concept Inventory (FCI), respectively. Repeated measures analysis of variance of how PBL influence beliefs and conceptual understanding were performed. The PBL group showed significantly higher conceptual learning gains in FCI than the traditional group. PBL approach showed no influence on students’ beliefs about physics; both groups displayed similar beliefs. A significant positive correlation was found between beliefs and conceptual understanding. Students with more expert-like beliefs at the beginning of the semester were more likely to obtain higher conceptual understanding scores at the end of the semester. Suggestions are presented regarding the implementation of the PBL approach.";2259569589;;;Scholarly Journals; Department of Secondary Science and Mathematics Education, Dokuz Eylül University, Buca, Izmir, Turkey;Sahin, Mehmet;;;; Journal of Science Education and Technology is a copyright of Springer, (2009).

Enterprise Integration: An Experiential Learning Model;With the ceaseless development of new and more advanced technologies, along with their growing influence and control over business and commerce, it is no surprise that the educational community is struggling to come up with programs to educate students to adequately handle these developments. Textbooks are becoming a thing of the past, for information and standards are changing faster than any publisher is willing to re-publish. Instead, a student of advancing business technologies must be able to adapt and learn from the 'here and now' while efficiently filtering out any antiquated information. These students must also be able to handle the myriad technologies currently in use and solve complex problems. This paper investigates innovations in experiential learning and their application to enterprise systems integration education.;1969022953; EJ1146941;;Scholarly Journals;;"Cameron, Brian H.;Purao, Sandeep";;; 722112 , 722141;;; Article , Report , 080: Journal Articles , 143: Reports - Research; 1545-679X;; Jun 2010;;;38; English; English;; 13;;Jun 2010;Information Systems Education Journal; Scholarly Journals , Reports;2010; http://isedj.org; ERIC, © Information Systems and Computing Academic Professionals;8;https://search.proquest.com/docview/1969022953?accountid=11774;;;;;; 1;;;  3707ER5 5901ER5  3692 5882 ,  3358ER5 2054ER5 1860ER5 10724ER5 1873ER5 10713ER5 8281ER5 6603ER5  3344 8251 6582 2043 10680 1862 10669 1849 ,  3229ER5 5205ER5  3215 5188 ,  10664ER5 3241ER5 6603ER5  10621 3227 6582 ,  5185ER5 10713ER5  5168 10669 ,  8257ER5 5901ER5  8227 5882 ,  5184ER5  5167 ,  5172ER5 8290ER5 3164ER5  5155 8260 3150 ,  8326ER5  8295 ,  1331ER5 8868ER5 3643ER5 6603ER5  1326 3629 6582 8836 ,  10685ER5 4527ER5 912ER5  10642 4511 909 ,  1815ER5 10321ER5 8043ER5 4558ER5  1806 10278 8016 4542 ,  3225ER5 4179ER5 4787ER5 9842ER5 9385ER5 5983ER5 4935ER5  3211 4164 4770 4918 5964 9804 9351 , Pennsylvania; Higher Education , Postsecondary Education , Pennsylvania;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aeric&amp;atitle=Enterprise+Integration%3A+An+Experiential+Learning+Model&amp;title=Information+Systems+Education+Journal&amp;issn=1545-679X&amp;date=2010-06-01&amp;volume=8&amp;issue=38&amp;spage=1&amp;au=Cameron%2C+Brian+H.%3BPurao%2C+Sandeep&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=Information+Systems+Education+Journal&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/EJ1146941&amp;rft_id=info:doi/";Social Science Premium Collection
Increasing Active Learning and End-Client Interaction in the Systems Analysis and Design and Capstone Courses;Systems analysis and design (SAD) is one of the core courses offered in most IS programs, yet this class can be challenging for students and instructors alike. The concepts can be abstract, and getting students to appreciate their importance can be difficult. This paper discusses the implementation of a two semester sequence in which the students are placed in teams to complete an analysis, design and implementation of a real world project for an end client. The result is the theories of the systems analysis and design course are placed into practice immediately through active learning and also the capstone projects have a higher level of success.;1969019093; EJ1146849;;Scholarly Journals;;"Reinicke, Bryan A.;Janicki, Thomas N.";;;;;; Article , Report , 080: Journal Articles , 141: Reports - Descriptive; 1545-679X;; Jun 2010;;;40; English; English;; 10;;Jun 2010;Information Systems Education Journal; Scholarly Journals , Reports;2010; http://isedj.org; ERIC, © Information Systems and Computing Academic Professionals;8;https://search.proquest.com/docview/1969019093?accountid=11774;;;;;; 1;;;  5184ER5  5167 ,  10685ER5 4527ER5 912ER5  10642 4511 909 ,  1985ER5 912ER5  1974 909 ,  10664ER5 3241ER5 6603ER5  10621 3227 6582 ,  2780ER5  2768 ,  10464ER5 6603ER5  10421 6582 ,  124ER5 5901ER5  124 5882 ,  2526ER5  2515 ,  1815ER5 10321ER5 8043ER5 4558ER5  1806 10278 8016 4542 , North Carolina; Higher Education , Postsecondary Education , North Carolina;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aeric&amp;atitle=Increasing+Active+Learning+and+End-Client+Interaction+in+the+Systems+Analysis+and+Design+and+Capstone+Courses&amp;title=Information+Systems+Education+Journal&amp;issn=1545-679X&amp;date=2010-06-01&amp;volume=8&amp;issue=40&amp;spage=1&amp;au=Reinicke%2C+Bryan+A.%3BJanicki%2C+Thomas+N.&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=Information+Systems+Education+Journal&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/EJ1146849&amp;rft_id=info:doi/";Social Science Premium Collection
A Generalized Thurstonian Paired Comparison Multicriteria Heuristic Model for Peer Evaluation of Individual Performance on IS Team Projects;"Information Systems instructors are generally encouraged to introduce team projects into their pedagogy, with a consequential issue of objectively evaluating the performance of each individual team member. The concept of ""freeloading"" is well-known for team projects, and for this, and other reasons, a peer review process of team members, by team members, is often advocated. We propose an objective heuristic model for obtaining a scale of individual performance, based upon a generalization of Thurstone's Law of Comparative Judgment, where pair wise comparisons of team member's performance are elicited with regard to various criteria, and we demonstrate how a scale may be obtained to objectively rate the individual members of each team. A numerical example is provided to illustrate our Generalized Thurstone model's heuristic methodologies.";1969016112; EJ1146947;;Scholarly Journals;;Scher, Julian M.;;;;;; Article , Report , 080: Journal Articles , 141: Reports - Descriptive; 1545-679X;; Jun 2010;;;23; English; English;; 9;;Jun 2010;Information Systems Education Journal; Scholarly Journals , Reports;2010; http://isedj.org; ERIC, © Information Systems and Computing Academic Professionals;8;https://search.proquest.com/docview/1969016112?accountid=11774;;;;;; 1;;;  5184ER5  5167 ,  10685ER5 4527ER5 912ER5  10642 4511 909 ,  10282ER5 9179ER5 126ER5  10240 9146 126 ,  10247ER5 3640ER5  10205 3626 ,  7696ER5 3640ER5  7669 3626 ,  3643ER5 6603ER5  3629 6582 ,  1966ER5 3643ER5 6603ER5  1955 3629 6582 ,  4730ER5 6603ER5  4713 6582 ,  6775ER5 9687ER5 6603ER5  6752 9651 6582 ,  1815ER5 10321ER5 8043ER5 4558ER5  1806 10278 8016 4542; Higher Education , Postsecondary Education;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aeric&amp;atitle=A+Generalized+Thurstonian+Paired+Comparison+Multicriteria+Heuristic+Model+for+Peer+Evaluation+of+Individual+Performance+on+IS+Team+Projects&amp;title=Information+Systems+Education+Journal&amp;issn=1545-679X&amp;date=2010-06-01&amp;volume=8&amp;issue=23&amp;spage=1&amp;au=Scher%2C+Julian+M.&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=Information+Systems+Education+Journal&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/EJ1146947&amp;rft_id=info:doi/";Social Science Premium Collection
Distributing attention across multiple social worlds;  Being a member of both local and global teams requires constant distribution and re-distribution of attention, engagement, and intensive communication over synchronous and asynchronous channels with remote and local partners. We explore in this paper the increasing number of social worlds such participants distribute their attention to, how this affects their level of engagement and attention, and how the workspace, collaboration technologies, and interaction modes afford and constrain the communicative events. The use of information and collaboration technologies (ICT) shapes and reshapes work spaces, processes, and social interactions among team members, and team members reshape ICT and the way it is used. We use as a testbed the AEC Global Teamwork course established at Stanford in 1993 in collaboration with universities worldwide and provide examples from two sites--Stanford PBL Lab, California USA and Chalmers University, Goteborg Sweden. We used temporal analysis and qualitative methods of inquiry in order to study participants' attention, how they used the site and the means, i.e., their social and material resources, to accomplish their interaction needs, and how they engaged throughout project reviews.

Virtual software team project management;  Issue Title: Global Software Engineering Globally distributed information systems development has become a key strategy for large sections of the software industry. This involves outsourcing projects to third parties or offshoring development to divisions in remote locations. A popular approach when implementing these strategies is the establishment of virtual teams. The justification for embarking on this approach is to endeavor to leverage the potential benefits of labor arbitrage available between geographical locations. When implementing such a strategy organizations must recognize that virtual teams operate differently to collocated teams, therefore, they must be managed differently. These differences arise due to the complex and collaborative nature of information systems development and the impact distance introduces. Geographical, temporal, cultural, and linguistic distance all negatively impact on coordination, cooperation, communication, and visibility in the virtual team setting. In these circumstances, it needs to be recognized that the project management of a virtual team must be carried out in a different manner to that of a collocated team. Results from this research highlight six specific project management areas, which need to be addressed to facilitate successful virtual team operation. They are: Organizational Virtual Team Strategy, Risk Management, Infrastructure, Implementation of a Virtual Team Process, Team Structure and Organization, and Conflict Management.;1773053291;;;Scholarly Journals;;Casey, Valentine;;;; The Brazilian Computer Society 2010; 10.1007/s13173-010-0013-3; Journal Article;;; May 2010;;0104-6500;2; English; English;; 83-96; Rio de Janeiro;May 2010;Journal of the Brazilian Computer Society;;2010;;;16;https://search.proquest.com/docview/1773053291?accountid=11774;;;;;; 83;;;; Project management , Virtual teams , Global Software Development (GSD) , Culture , Coordination , Cooperation , Communication , Visibility , Tools , Process re-engineering , Knowledge transfer;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Acompscijour&amp;atitle=Virtual+software+team+project+management&amp;title=Journal+of+the+Brazilian+Computer+Society&amp;issn=01046500&amp;date=2010-05-01&amp;volume=16&amp;issue=2&amp;spage=83&amp;au=Casey%2C+Valentine&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=Journal+of+the+Brazilian+Computer+Society&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/10.1007%2Fs13173-010-0013-3";ProQuest Central,SciTech Premium Collection
Towards Greater Learner Control: Web Supported Project-Based Learning;Project-based learning has been suggested as an appropriate pedagogy to prepare students in information systems for the realities of the business world. Web-based resources have been used to support such pedagogy with mixed results. The paper argues that the design of web-based learning support to cater to different learning styles may give students more control over the learning process. A case study approach was used to analyse an undergraduate information systems class in a French business school. The results show that while students generally believe they attained the class learning objectives, they react very differently to this pedagogy.

Leveraging PBL and Game to Redesign an Introductory Course;  The purpose of this paper is to discuss one instructional design that leverages problem-based learning and game structures as a means of developing innovative higher education courses for students as responsive, lived experiences. This paper reviews a curricular redesign that stemmed from the evaluation of an introductory course in computer applications that had high drop, failure, and withdrawal (D/F/W) rates. Interviews with students and faculty in this course revealed that students were not engaged with, motivated by, or satisfied with the instructional methods, which were often frustrating and difficult to navigate. Using data collected from students and faculty, we describe the full redesign of the course, which included ill-structured problems for students to solve, multiple forms of learning assessment, and a contextual framing stemming from a digital, alternate reality game design. When comparing the new design to the original, the first iteration research indicated decreased failure rates, increased achievement on standardized assessments, and a range of individual student experiences from high praise of the design to some disappointment.;1473901141;;;Scholarly Journals;;"Warren, Scott J;Dondlinger, Mary Jo;Jones, Greg;Whitworth, Cliff";;;; Copyright iManager Publications Apr-Jun 2010;; Journal Article;;; Apr-Jun 2010;;0973-0559;1; English; English;; 40-51; Nagercoil;Apr-Jun 2010;i-Manager's Journal of Educational Technology;;2010;;;7;https://search.proquest.com/docview/1473901141?accountid=11774;;;;;; 40;;;; Undergraduate , Computer Literacy , Problem-based Learning , Course Redesign;"http://sfx.nelliportaali.fi/nelli09b?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aindianjournals&amp;atitle=Leveraging+PBL+and+Game+to+Redesign+an+Introductory+Course&amp;title=i-Manager%27s+Journal+of+Educational+Technology&amp;issn=09730559&amp;date=2010-04-01&amp;volume=7&amp;issue=1&amp;spage=40&amp;au=Warren%2C+Scott+J%3BDondlinger%2C+Mary+Jo%3BJones%2C+Greg%3BWhitworth%2C+Cliff&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=i-Manager%27s+Journal+of+Educational+Technology&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/";ProQuest Central
